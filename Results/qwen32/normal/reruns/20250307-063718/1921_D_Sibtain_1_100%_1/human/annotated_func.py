#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100. For each test case, n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5. a_i is a list of n integers where each a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. b_i is a list of m integers where each b_i satisfies 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: the output state you calculate.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of two lists of integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value that represents the minimum possible sum of the maximum absolute differences between elements of the two lists when paired optimally.
