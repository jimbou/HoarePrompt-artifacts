#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. For each test case, n, m, and k are integers such that 1 <= k <= m <= n <= 2 * 10^5. a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= a_i <= 10^6. b is a list of m integers where each integer is in the range 1 <= b_i <= 10^6. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, and the sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.

    #State: `cnt_b` is a list of 1000001 zeros.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it determines how many contiguous subarrays of length `m` in list `a` contain at least `k` elements that are also present in list `b`. The function prints the result for each test case.
