#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, x is an integer such that 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2 · 10^5), and y is an integer such that 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x. The sum of x over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5. The second line of each test case consists of x distinct integers from 1 to n, representing the vertices Bessie has chosen.

    #State: the final value of `cons` printed in the last iteration of the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and a list of `x` distinct integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value `cons` which represents a specific configuration based on the given constraints.
