#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of multiple test cases. Each test case starts with an integer n (3 ≤ n ≤ 3·10^5), representing the number of houses. The next line contains a string a of length n, consisting only of the characters '0' and '1', where '0' indicates a resident wants to live on the left side and '1' indicates a resident wants to live on the right side. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3·10^5.

    #State: a series of integers, each representing the boundary position for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` representing the number of houses and a string `a` of length `n` with characters '0' and '1'. It calculates and prints the optimal boundary position for each test case such that the number of '0's on the left side and '1's on the right side are as balanced as possible.
