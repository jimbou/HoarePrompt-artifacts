#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 1440. Each of the following t lines contains a string s of length 5 in the format "hh:mm", where hh is a two-digit integer from 00 to 23 representing the hour, and mm is a two-digit integer from 00 to 59 representing the minute. The input will always be a valid time in 24-hour format.

    #State: For each of the t lines of input, the output will be the time converted to 12-hour format with AM/PM. Each output will be in the format "hh:mm AM" or "hh:mm PM" where hh is the hour in 12-hour format, mm is the minute, and AM/PM indicates the period of the day.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `t` representing the number of time entries, each in the format "hh:mm" in 24-hour format. It then converts each time entry to the 12-hour format with AM/PM and prints the converted time.
