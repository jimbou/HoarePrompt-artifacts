This function reads a series of input pairs (x, n) from the standard input, where x is a number and n is a divisor, and for each pair, it calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a number that can be obtained by subtracting n times a divisor of x from x, such that the result is divisible by the divisor. The function processes multiple input pairs, as specified by an initial integer t, and outputs the maximum possible value for each pair.
