Functionality: **This function generates a string of length 'n' where each character corresponds to the alphabetical position of the count of occurrences of the corresponding element in list 'a', and updates a dictionary 'a_map' to store the count of occurrences of each element in list 'a'. The function takes a positive integer 'n' and a list 'a' of 'n' non-negative integers as input, and returns the generated string. The input list 'a' and the integer 'n' remain unchanged.**
