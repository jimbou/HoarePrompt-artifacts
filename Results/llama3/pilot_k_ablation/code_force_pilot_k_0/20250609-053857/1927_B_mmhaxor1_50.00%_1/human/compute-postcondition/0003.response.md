Output State: **The program returns a string 'res' of length 'n' where each character is the i-th letter of the alphabet (where i is the value of a_map[a[j]] % 27 at the j-th iteration of the loop), 'n' remains unchanged, 'a' remains unchanged, 'sam' remains unchanged, and 'a_map' has been updated such that for each key 'i', a_map[i] is equal to the number of occurrences of 'i' in list 'a'.**
