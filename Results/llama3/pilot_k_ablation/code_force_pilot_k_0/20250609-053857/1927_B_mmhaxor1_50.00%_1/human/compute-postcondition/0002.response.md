Output State: The final state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: n remains unchanged, a remains unchanged, sam remains unchanged, a_map has been updated such that for each key i, a_map[i] is equal to the number of occurrences of i in list a, and res is a string of length n where each character is the i-th letter of the alphabet (where i is the value of a_map[a[j]] % 27 at the j-th iteration of the loop).
