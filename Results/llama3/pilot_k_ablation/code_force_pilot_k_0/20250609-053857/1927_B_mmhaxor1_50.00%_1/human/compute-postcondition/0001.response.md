Output State: The string res is a string of length n, where each character is a lowercase letter from 'a' to 'z'. The string is constructed by iterating over the list a, and for each element a_i, it appends the character at index a_map[a_i] % 27 in the string sam to res, and then increments the value of a_map[a_i] by 1. The values of a_map are incremented in a cyclic manner, i.e., after reaching 'z', it wraps around to 'a'. The final state of a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1, where each value is the count of occurrences of the corresponding index in the list a.
