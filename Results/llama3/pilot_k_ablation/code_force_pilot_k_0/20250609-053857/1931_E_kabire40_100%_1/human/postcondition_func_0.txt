This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and m, representing the length of a list and a maximum power, respectively. The second line contains a list of n integers. The function then sorts the list based on the length of each integer (excluding trailing zeros) and constructs a new string by concatenating the sorted integers, with even-indexed integers having their trailing zeros removed. Finally, the function prints 'Sasha' if the length of the constructed string is greater than or equal to m + 1, and 'Anna' otherwise.
