Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates a value 'ans' for each test case based on the input values and prints the result. The function iterates through all test cases, performing calculations and printing results without modifying the input values or any external state.**
