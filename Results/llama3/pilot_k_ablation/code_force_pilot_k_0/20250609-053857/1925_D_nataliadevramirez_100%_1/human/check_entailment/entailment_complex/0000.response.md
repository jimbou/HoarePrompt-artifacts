Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input values for each test case, including the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k).
2.  It initializes the sum of friendship values (S) to 0 and then calculates the sum of the initial friendship values for all pairs of friends.
3.  The program calculates the total number of possible pairs of children (C) using the formula n \* (n - 1) / 2.
4.  It calculates the numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the expected value of the sum of friendship values using the given formulas.
5.  The program calculates the greatest common divisor (g) of the numerator and denominator and divides both by g to simplify the fraction.
6.  It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator (den) modulo MOD (10^9 + 7) using the pow function with a negative exponent.
7.  Finally, the program calculates the result (ans) by multiplying the numerator by the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator and taking the result modulo MOD.

The program correctly implements the mathematical formulas provided in the problem description and handles the calculations modulo 10^9 + 7 as required.

Correctness: **True**
