Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to calculate the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions. It reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. The program calculates a value 'ans' for each test case based on the input values and prints the result.

The program uses the formula for the expected value of the sum of friendship values, which is derived from the problem description. It calculates the numerator and denominator of the expected value, reduces the fraction to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, and then calculates the modular inverse of the denominator modulo 10^9+7. Finally, it multiplies the numerator by the modular inverse of the denominator and takes the result modulo 10^9+7 to obtain the final answer.

The program correctly handles the input values, performs the necessary calculations, and prints the results without modifying the input values or any external state. Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
