Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. It calculates the maximum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. The calculation is done by simulating the worst-case scenario where Sasha loses x times in a row, and then wins once. The amount of coins Sasha needs to have is the sum of the amounts he needs to bet in each of the x+1 rounds.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as when x is 1, or when a is very large. The use of the floor division operator (//) ensures that the calculation is done correctly even when the result is not an integer.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore I conclude that the program is correct.
