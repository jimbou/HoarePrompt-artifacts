Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the number of players remaining after each iteration of the game, and the `func_2` function correctly uses these results to answer the queries for each test case.

The program handles all possible inputs as described in the problem statement, including the case where `t` is 0, in which case it correctly returns an empty list.

The use of the `bisect` module to efficiently find the number of players to eliminate in each iteration is also correct.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
