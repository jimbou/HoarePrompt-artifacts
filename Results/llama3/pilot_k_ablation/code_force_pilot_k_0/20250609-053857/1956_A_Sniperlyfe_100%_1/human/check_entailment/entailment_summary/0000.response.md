Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem described, where Nene's game is simulated, and the number of players declared as winners is determined for each test case. 

Function 1 (`func_1`) calculates the number of players remaining after each iteration of the game, based on a given list of unique integers `p`. It uses the `bisect` module to efficiently find the number of players to eliminate in each round. The function returns a list of these remaining player counts.

Function 2 (`func_2`) is the main function that takes no arguments and returns a list of lists containing the remaining players in the game. It reads the input, calls `func_1` with the list `p` as an argument, and uses the result to create a list of remaining players at the indices specified by `qs`.

The program correctly implements the game simulation and determines the number of players declared as winners for each test case. It handles the input and output correctly and uses the `bisect` module efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
