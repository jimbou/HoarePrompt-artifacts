Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1. The program first defines a function `func_1(p)` that calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players `n` from 1 to 100. This function uses a while loop to simulate the game rounds, and the `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` function is used to count the number of players that are kicked out in each round.

2. The function `func_2()` reads the input, calls `func_1(p)` to calculate the remaining players for each possible initial number of players, and then uses this information to answer the queries.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the number of players `n` is less than the minimum value in the sequence `p`. In this case, the `while` loop in `func_1(p)` will not be executed, and the number of remaining players will be `n`.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where the number of players `n` is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the sequence `p`. In this case, the `while` loop in `func_1(p)` will be executed, and the number of remaining players will be calculated correctly.

5. The program uses a list comprehension to generate the results for each query, which is an efficient and correct way to do so.

6. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that would prevent it from producing the correct output.

Therefore, based on the analysis above, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
