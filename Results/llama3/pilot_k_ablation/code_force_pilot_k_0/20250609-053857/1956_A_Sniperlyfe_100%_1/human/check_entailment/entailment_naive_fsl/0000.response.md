Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly simulates the game and determines the number of players declared as winners for each initial number of players.

The program uses a clever approach by precomputing the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players (from 1 to 100) using the `func_1` function. This function uses binary search to efficiently determine the number of players that will be kicked out in each round.

The `func_2` function then uses the precomputed results to answer the queries for each test case.

I have analyzed the program and could not find any potential case where it does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and edge cases, including the cases where the initial number of players is less than the minimum value in the sequence `a`, or where the sequence `a` contains duplicate values.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
