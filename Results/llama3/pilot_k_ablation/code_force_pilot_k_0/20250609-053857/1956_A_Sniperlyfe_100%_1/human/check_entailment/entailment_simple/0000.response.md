Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game logic and calculates the number of players remaining after each round. The use of the `bisect` module to find the count of players that have been eliminated is efficient and accurate.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases, the sequence `a`, and the queries `n_i`, and printing the results in the required format.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the number of players remaining after each round by subtracting the count of eliminated players from the current number of players. The use of a precomputed table `remaining_players` to store the results for each possible number of players is also efficient.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
