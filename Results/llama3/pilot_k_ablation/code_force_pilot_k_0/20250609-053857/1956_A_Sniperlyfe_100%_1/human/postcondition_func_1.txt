This function takes no arguments and returns a list of lists containing the remaining players in a game. It first reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer k (not used in the function), an integer q, a list of distinct integers p, and a list of indices qs. It then calls another function func_1 with the list p as an argument, and uses the result to create a list of remaining players at the indices specified by qs. The function returns a list of these results for all test cases. If t is 0, the function returns an empty list.
