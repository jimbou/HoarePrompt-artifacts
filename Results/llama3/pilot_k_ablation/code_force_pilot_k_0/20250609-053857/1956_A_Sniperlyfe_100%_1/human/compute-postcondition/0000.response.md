Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that 1 <= p[0] < p[1] < ... < p[len(p)-1] <= 100, and len(p) is a non-negative integer, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains one less input than before.**

The first line of the code assigns an integer value from stdin to the variable t. As a result, stdin now contains one less input than before. The second line initializes an empty list called results. The variable p remains unchanged, retaining its initial state as a list of distinct integers within the specified range.
