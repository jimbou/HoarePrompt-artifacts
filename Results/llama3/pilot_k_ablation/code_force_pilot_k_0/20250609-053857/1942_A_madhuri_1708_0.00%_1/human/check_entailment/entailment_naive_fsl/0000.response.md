Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n > 1. In this case, the program prints the numbers from 0 to n-1, but this does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "0 1 2", but the cyclic shifts of this array are [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0], and [2, 0, 1], and only the first one is sorted, so this does not satisfy the condition.

The correct solution should print an array where the first k elements are in increasing order, and the rest of the elements are in decreasing order. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the correct output should be "1 2 1", because the cyclic shifts of this array are [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], and [1, 1, 2], and only the first one is sorted.
