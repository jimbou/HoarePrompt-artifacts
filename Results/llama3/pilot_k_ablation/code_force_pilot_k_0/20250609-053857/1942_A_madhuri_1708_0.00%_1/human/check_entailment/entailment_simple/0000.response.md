Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program uses a simple approach based on the value of `k`.

If `k` is 1, the program prints a sequence of integers from 0 to `n-1`. This is a valid solution because the only sorted cyclic shift is the original sequence itself.

If `k` is greater than 1 and equal to `n`, the program prints a sequence of `k` repeated `k` times. This is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this sequence are sorted.

If `k` is greater than 1 and not equal to `n`, the program prints -1. This is correct because it is impossible to find an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts in this case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
