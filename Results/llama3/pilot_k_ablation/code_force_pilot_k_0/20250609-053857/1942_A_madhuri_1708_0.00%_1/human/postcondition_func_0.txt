The function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, representing the number of test cases. Each subsequent line contains two integers, n and k, where n is the number of elements in a sequence and k is a parameter that determines the sequence's pattern. The function generates and prints t sequences, each based on the values of n and k. If k is 1, the sequence consists of integers from 0 to n-1. If k is greater than 1 and equal to n, the sequence consists of k repeated k times. If k is greater than 1 and not equal to n, the sequence is -1. The function prints each sequence on a separate line, resulting in t lines of output.
