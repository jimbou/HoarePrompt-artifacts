Output State: **The output state contains t lines, each containing a sequence of integers. If k is 1, the sequence is a list of integers from 0 to n-1. If k is greater than 1 and equal to n, the sequence is a list of k repeated k times. If k is greater than 1 and not equal to n, the sequence is -1.**
