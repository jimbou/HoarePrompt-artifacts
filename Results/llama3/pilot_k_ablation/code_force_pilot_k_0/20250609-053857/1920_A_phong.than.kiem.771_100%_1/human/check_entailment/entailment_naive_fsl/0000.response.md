Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It first finds the start and end values by iterating through the constraints and updating the start and end values accordingly. Then, it counts the number of integers in the range [start, end] that are not equal to any of the values in the num list. Finally, it returns the total count of integers that satisfy all constraints.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

* When there are no constraints of type 3 (i.e., no values to exclude), the program correctly returns the total count of integers in the range [start, end].
* When there are constraints of type 3, the program correctly excludes those values from the count.
* When the start value is greater than the end value, the program correctly returns 0, indicating that there are no integers that satisfy all constraints.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input values are at the boundaries of the range (e.g., start = 1, end = 1000000000).

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
