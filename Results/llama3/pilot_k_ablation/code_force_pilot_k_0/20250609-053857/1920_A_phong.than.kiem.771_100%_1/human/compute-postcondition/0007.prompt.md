You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and then n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of start is the maximum of its initial value and the maximum value of v when t is 1, the value of end is the minimum of its initial value and the minimum value of v when t is 2, and num is a list of values of v when t is 3.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of start is the maximum of its initial value and the maximum value of v when t is 1, the value of end is the minimum of its initial value and the minimum value of v when t is 2, num is a list of values of v when t is 3, and count_num is the number of values in num that are within the range [start, end].
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the minimum value of v when t is 2 and the maximum value of v when t is 1, plus 1, minus the number of values in num that are within this range, if this range is valid (i.e., the minimum value is less than or equal to the maximum value); otherwise, it returns 0.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the minimum value of v when t is 2 and the maximum value of v when t is 1, plus 1, minus the number of values in num that are within this range, if this range is valid (i.e., the minimum value is less than or equal to the maximum value); otherwise, it returns 0.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
