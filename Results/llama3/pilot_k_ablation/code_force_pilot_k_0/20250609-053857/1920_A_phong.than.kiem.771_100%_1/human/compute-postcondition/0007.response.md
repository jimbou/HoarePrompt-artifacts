Functionality: **This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum and minimum values of 'v' when 't' is 1 and 2, respectively, from a series of input pairs (t, v). The function returns this count, or 0 if the range is invalid (i.e., the minimum value is greater than the maximum value).**
