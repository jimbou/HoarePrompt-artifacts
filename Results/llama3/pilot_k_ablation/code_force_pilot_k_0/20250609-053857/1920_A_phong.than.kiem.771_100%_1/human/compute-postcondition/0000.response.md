The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the standard input, initializes two variables `start` and `end`, and creates an empty list `num`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

*   The first line reads an integer `n` from the standard input, which means `n` is now an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). This also means that the standard input now contains `n` lines, each with two integers.
*   The second line initializes the variable `start` to -1.
*   The third line initializes the variable `end` to 1,000,000,000 (1 billion).
*   The fourth line creates an empty list called `num`.

After executing the entire code block, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), start is -1, end is 1,000,000,000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n lines, each containing two integers.**
