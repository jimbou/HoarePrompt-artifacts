#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value that is entered by the user through the input function. The value of the boolean variable `isOne` is not used in the return statement and remains False.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1

#Overall this is what the function does:This function returns an integer value based on the input boolean variable `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, it prompts the user to enter an integer value and returns it. If `isOne` is True, it returns the integer 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value and to_int is a boolean value.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string. If `space` is true, `items` is a list of strings split from `line`. If `space` is false, `items` is a list of characters in the string `line`.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is true, the list contains integers converted from the strings split from `line`. If `space` is false, the list contains integers converted from the characters in the string `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of strings or characters. If `space` is true, the list contains strings split from `line`. If `space` is false, the list contains individual characters from the string `line`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string input from the user and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is true, the function splits the input string into a list of substrings separated by spaces. If `space` is false, the function converts the input string into a list of individual characters. If `to_int` is true, the function attempts to convert each item in the list into an integer. The function returns the resulting list, which can contain either integers or strings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.

    return string
    #The program returns the concatenated string of all elements in the arr list, with each element separated by the sym string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of values and a separator string as input, concatenates all elements in the list into a single string with the separator in between each element, and returns the resulting concatenated string.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings, and substring is not an empty string.
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)

    #State: indices is a list of all the indices of the occurrences of substring in string, index is -1.
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of all the indices of the occurrences of substring in string.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of their indices. It accepts two parameters: a string and a non-empty substring. After execution, the function returns a list of indices where the substring is found in the string. If the substring is not found, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and element is a value of any type.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices where the element appears in the list 'arr'. The list 'arr' contains elements of any type and the element is a value of any type.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list, regardless of the element's type. It leaves the original list unchanged and returns an empty list if the element is not found.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of integers, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is an integer.
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: Output State: The loop will return the first sub-array in the 2D list 'arr' where the element at the specified 'index' is equal to the given 'value'. If no such sub-array is found, the loop will not return anything (i.e., it will implicitly return None). The state of the variables 'arr', 'index', and 'value' remains unchanged.
    return None
    #The program returns None.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches a 2D list of integers for the first sub-array where the element at a specified index matches a given value, returning that sub-array if found, otherwise returning None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) and then n lines, each containing two integers t and v (1 <= t <= 3, 1 <= v <= 10^9).

            num.append(v)
        
    #State: Output State: The value of start is the maximum of its initial value and the maximum value of v when t is 1, the value of end is the minimum of its initial value and the minimum value of v when t is 2, and num is a list of values of v when t is 3.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: Output State: The value of start is the maximum of its initial value and the maximum value of v when t is 1, the value of end is the minimum of its initial value and the minimum value of v when t is 2, num is a list of values of v when t is 3, and count_num is the number of values in num that are within the range [start, end].
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the minimum value of v when t is 2 and the maximum value of v when t is 1, plus 1, minus the number of values in num that are within this range, if this range is valid (i.e., the minimum value is less than or equal to the maximum value); otherwise, it returns 0.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. The range is defined by the maximum and minimum values of 'v' when 't' is 1 and 2, respectively, from a series of input pairs (t, v). The function returns this count, or 0 if the range is invalid (i.e., the minimum value is greater than the maximum value).
