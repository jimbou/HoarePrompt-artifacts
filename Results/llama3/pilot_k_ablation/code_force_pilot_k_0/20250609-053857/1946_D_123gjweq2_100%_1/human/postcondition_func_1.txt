This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit` such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and a non-negative integer `x` such that 0 <= x < 2^30 as input. It returns the maximum value between the length of a new list `new_arr` created by XORing elements in `cur_arr` and the result of a recursive call to the function `find_new` with `cur_arr` and `bit - 1` as arguments, or -1 if the bit-th bit of the XOR result is 1. If `bit` is -1, the function returns the length of `cur_arr`. The function performs XOR operations, creates a new list, and makes recursive calls to itself.
