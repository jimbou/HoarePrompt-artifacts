Output State: **The program returns the result of the function `find_new` called with the list `new_arr` and the argument `bit - 1`. The list `new_arr` contains non-negative integers and its length is stored in the variable `thing1`, which is not equal to -1. The value of `bit - 1` is not specified, but it is related to the integer `xor` which has a bit-th bit equal to 0.**
