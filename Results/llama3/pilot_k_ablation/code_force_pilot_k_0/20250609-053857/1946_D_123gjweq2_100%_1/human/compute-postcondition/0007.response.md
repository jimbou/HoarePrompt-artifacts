Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is an integer such that 0 <= `xor` < 2^30, and the current value of `xor` has a bit set at position `bit`, `thing1` is -1**

In this output state, the values of `new_arr` and `xor` remain unchanged, as the code only introduces a new variable `thing1` and assigns it the value -1. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is still set to 1. The introduction of `thing1` does not affect the existing variables, so their properties and values are preserved.
