Output State: **`new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is an integer such that 0 <= xor < 2^30, and the bit-th bit of xor is 0, `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` is equal to the length of the list `new_arr`, which is a list of non-negative integers. The value of `xor` remains unchanged, still being an integer between 0 and 2^30, and the bit-th bit of `xor` is still 0. The list `new_arr` also remains unchanged.
