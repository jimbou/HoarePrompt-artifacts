Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), but the first test case has been read and its value is stored in `t`.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been read and its value is stored in `t`. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin, each containing two lines of input: the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
