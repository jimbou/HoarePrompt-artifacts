Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program works by first sorting the array, then finding the median and its index. It then calculates the total number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal to the median.

However, the problem statement requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median, not to make all elements equal to the median. The program's approach is incorrect because it calculates the total number of operations required to make all elements equal to the median, which is not the same as finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median.

For example, in the test case [5, 5, 5, 4, 5], the program calculates the total number of operations required to make all elements equal to the median (5) as 3, but the correct answer is 3 because we can increase the median by applying one operation to each of the numbers at indices 1, 2, and 3.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
