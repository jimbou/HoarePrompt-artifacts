Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The issue lies in the way it calculates the operations. The program currently calculates the operations by summing up the differences between the median and all numbers less than the median. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where increasing a number less than the median does not necessarily increase the median.

For example, consider the input [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. The median of this array is 1. If we increase the first number to 2, the median is still 1. However, the program would incorrectly calculate the operations as 0, because it only considers the differences between the median and numbers less than the median.

A correct approach would be to find the number of elements that are equal to the median and need to be increased to a value greater than the median. This can be done by counting the number of elements that are equal to the median and then adding 1 to the count if the length of the array is odd.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        median = a[median_index]
        operations = 0
        count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if a[i] == median:
                count += 1
        operations = count
        if n % 2 == 0:
            operations += 1
        print(operations)
```

This corrected program first counts the number of elements that are equal to the median. If the length of the array is even, it adds 1 to the count to ensure that the median is increased. The program then prints the total number of operations required to increase the median.
