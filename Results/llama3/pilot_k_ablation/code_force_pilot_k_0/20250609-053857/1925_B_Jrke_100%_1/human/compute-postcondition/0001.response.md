Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and n. For each test case, it calculates the maximum number of factors that can be obtained from x, considering factors up to x/n, and prints the result. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the maximum number of factors for each case.**
