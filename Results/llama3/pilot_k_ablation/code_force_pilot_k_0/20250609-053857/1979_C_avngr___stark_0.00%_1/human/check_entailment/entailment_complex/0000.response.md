Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases and the multipliers for each outcome as input and calculates the bets for each outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the bets and divides each bet by the GCD to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the LCM and the bets for each outcome, and it checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. The use of the GCD to minimize the total amount of coins bet is also correct.

However, the program assumes that the input is valid, i.e., the number of test cases and the multipliers are positive integers, and the number of outcomes is at least 1. If the input is invalid, the program may produce incorrect results or crash.

Correctness: **True**
