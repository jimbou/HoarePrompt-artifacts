Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of distributing coins in a game with n possible outcomes, where each outcome has a multiplier k_i. The goal is to distribute the coins such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program uses the concept of the least common multiple (LCM) to find the minimum amount of coins that need to be bet on each outcome. It calculates the LCM of all the multipliers k_i and then divides it by each k_i to get the amount of coins to be bet on each outcome. The program then checks if the sum of these amounts is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the amounts; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers. This function is used to find the GCD of the amounts of coins to be bet on each outcome, which is then used to reduce the amounts.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
