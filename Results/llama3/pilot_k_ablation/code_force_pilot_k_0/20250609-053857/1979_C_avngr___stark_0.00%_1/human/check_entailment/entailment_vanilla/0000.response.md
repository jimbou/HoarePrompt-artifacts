Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and the multiplier for each outcome as input, and it outputs the amount of coins to bet on each outcome.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the program:

1. The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers. This is done by multiplying all the multipliers together.

2. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome.

3. After that, it calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of all the amounts calculated in the previous step. This is done using a custom function `func_1` that uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the HCF.

4. The program then divides each amount by the HCF to get the smallest possible amounts that still satisfy the condition.

5. Finally, it checks if the sum of all the amounts is less than the LCM. If it is, it prints out the amounts; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the smallest possible amounts that satisfy the condition. The use of LCM and HCF ensures that the amounts are minimized while still ensuring that the sum of the amounts is less than the LCM.

Correctness: **True**
