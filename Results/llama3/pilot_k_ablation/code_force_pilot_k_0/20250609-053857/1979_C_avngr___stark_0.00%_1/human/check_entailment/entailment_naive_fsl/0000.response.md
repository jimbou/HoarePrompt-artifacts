Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, then divides the LCM by each multiplier to get the bet for each outcome. The program also checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM, and if not, it prints -1.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including the case where the number of outcomes is 1, and the case where the multipliers are all the same. It also handles the case where the sum of the bets is equal to the LCM, in which case it prints -1.

The program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is used to calculate the LCM. The `func_1` function is used to calculate the highest common factor (HCF) of a list of numbers, which is used to simplify the bets.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
