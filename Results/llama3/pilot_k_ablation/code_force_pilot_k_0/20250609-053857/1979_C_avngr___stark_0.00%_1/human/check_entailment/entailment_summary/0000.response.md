Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where you need to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of outcomes and their respective multipliers as input and calculates the bets for each outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. The program then checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome; otherwise, it prints -1.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers. This function is used to find the GCD of the bets for each outcome, which is then used to reduce the bets to their simplest form.

The execution summary shows that the program correctly calculates the GCD of the bets for each outcome and reduces them to their simplest form.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
