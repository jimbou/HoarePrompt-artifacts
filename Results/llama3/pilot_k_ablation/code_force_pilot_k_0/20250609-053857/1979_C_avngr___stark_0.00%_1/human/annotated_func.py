#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list is composed of test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) represents the number of outcomes, and the next n integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_n (2 ≤ k_i ≤ 20) represent the multipliers for the amount of coins if the i-th outcome turns out to be winning.
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: The value of `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the initial value of `hcf` and all the integers in the `numbers` list, excluding the first element. The `numbers` list remains unchanged.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the initial value of `hcf` and all the integers in the `numbers` list, excluding the first element.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the input list, excluding the first element, which is assumed to be the initial value for the GCD calculation. The function takes a list of integers as input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and the rest of the list contains test cases with their respective multipliers. The function does not modify the input list.
