This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the input list, excluding the first element, which is assumed to be the initial value for the GCD calculation. The function takes a list of integers as input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and the rest of the list contains test cases with their respective multipliers. The function does not modify the input list.
