This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers n and m. It then checks each case against two conditions: (1) if n is less than m, it prints 'NO'; (2) if n and m are both odd or both even, it prints 'YES'. The function outputs 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether the given numbers satisfy the conditions. The number of output lines equals the number of test cases.
