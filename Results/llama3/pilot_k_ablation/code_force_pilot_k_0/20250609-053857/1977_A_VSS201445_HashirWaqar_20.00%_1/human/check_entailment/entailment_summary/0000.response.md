Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The given program checks two conditions:

1. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO'. This is correct because Nikita cannot build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves he makes.

2. If n and m are both odd or both even, it prints 'YES'. This is also correct because Nikita can build a tower with an odd number of cubes if he makes an odd number of moves (by putting one cube on top and then removing none), and he can build a tower with an even number of cubes if he makes an even number of moves (by putting two cubes on top and then removing none).

However, the program does not handle the case where n is greater than or equal to m and n and m have different parity (one is odd and the other is even). In this case, Nikita can still build a tower with m cubes by making some moves to put cubes on top and then removing some cubes. For example, if n = 4 and m = 3, Nikita can put 3 cubes on top and then remove 1 cube.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases.

Correctness: **False**
