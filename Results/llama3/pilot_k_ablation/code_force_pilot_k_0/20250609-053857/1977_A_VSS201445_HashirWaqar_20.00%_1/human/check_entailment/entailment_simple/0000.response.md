Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either puts exactly 1 cube on top of the tower or removes exactly 1 cube from the top of the tower.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve the problem. It iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and m, and then checks two conditions:

1. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to build a tower with more cubes than the number of moves.

2. If n is greater than or equal to m, it checks the parity of both n and m. If both n and m are odd or both are even, it prints 'YES' because it's possible to build a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it doesn't print anything, which means the answer is 'NO' by default.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
