This function determines the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from a given tree data structure to satisfy a specific condition checked by another function (func_3). It takes as input a tree with n vertices and a non-negative integer k, and returns the minimum number of edges to be removed, without modifying the original tree or the input values.
