Output State: **The tree has n vertices and n - 1 edges, representing a connected graph with the specified vertices and edges, and the root of the tree is set to vertex 0, with its parent set to -1 (indicating no parent), and the tree has been traversed non-recursively starting from the root.**

In this output state, the tree's structure remains the same, with n vertices and n - 1 edges, representing a connected graph. The code `tree.root_tree_non_recursive(0, -1)` sets the root of the tree to vertex 0 and its parent to -1, indicating that vertex 0 has no parent. Additionally, the tree has been traversed non-recursively starting from the root vertex 0.
