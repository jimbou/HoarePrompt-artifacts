Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that k < n, n represents the number of vertices in a tree, k represents the number of edges to be removed, tree is a Tree object with n vertices**.

The code first reads two integers from the input, assigning them to n and k, respectively. Since n and k are already defined as positive integers in the initial state, their values are updated to the newly read values. The condition k < n is still valid after this update.

The second line creates a new Tree object with n vertices and assigns it to the variable tree. This introduces a new variable, tree, which is a Tree object with n vertices.

The final state includes the updated values of n and k, as well as the new variable tree, which is a Tree object with n vertices. The condition k < n is still valid, and the tree object has n vertices.
