Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem involving a tree data structure. The task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program consists of multiple functions that work together to achieve this goal. Function 1 (func_1) performs a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree and identifies the number of good components (subtrees with at least x vertices) in the subtree rooted at a specified vertex 's'. Function 2 (func_2) calculates the total number of good components and the total size of remaining components in the subtrees rooted at the children of a given vertex. Function 3 (func_3) determines if a tree meets certain conditions based on the number of good components and their size. Function 4 (func_4) determines the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from the tree to satisfy the conditions checked by func_3. Function 5 (func_5) is the main function that reads input, constructs the tree, and calls func_4 to find the result.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it appears that the functions are working correctly. The program correctly constructs the tree, performs the necessary traversals, and calculates the required values. The use of a binary search approach in func_4 to find the minimum number of edges to be removed is also correct.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
