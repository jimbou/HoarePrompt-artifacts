Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving a tree with n vertices, where the task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number x. It starts by initializing the search range to [1, n] and then iteratively checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the current mid value.

The program uses a recursive function (func_1) to perform a depth-first search (DFS) traversal of the tree and calculate the number of good components (subtrees with at least x vertices) and the total size of the remaining components that are not good components.

The program also uses another function (func_3) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function calls func_1 to perform the DFS traversal and then checks if the number of good components is greater than k or if the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number x by iteratively checking if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the current mid value. If it is possible, the program updates the search range to [mid, end]; otherwise, it updates the search range to [beg, mid - 1].

Finally, the program prints the result of the function func_4, which returns the minimum number of edges that need to be removed from the tree to satisfy the condition checked by func_3.

Correctness: **True**
