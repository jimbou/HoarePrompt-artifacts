Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_2` function, which is a recursive function that calculates the number of good components and the remaining size of the subtree rooted at a given vertex. However, this function does not correctly handle the case when the remaining size of a subtree is equal to `x`. In this case, the function should count the subtree as a good component, but it does not.

For example, consider a tree with 5 vertices, where vertex 0 has children 1 and 2, and vertex 2 has children 3 and 4. Suppose `k` is 1 and `x` is 2. In this case, the program should return 2, because we can remove the edge between vertices 0 and 2, and the resulting components will have sizes 2 and 3, both of which are greater than or equal to `x`. However, the program will return 1, because the `func_2` function does not correctly count the subtree rooted at vertex 2 as a good component.

To fix this issue, the `func_2` function should be modified to correctly handle the case when the remaining size of a subtree is equal to `x`. One possible solution is to add an additional condition to the `if` statement that checks if the remaining size of a subtree is greater than or equal to `x`, and if so, increments the count of good components.
