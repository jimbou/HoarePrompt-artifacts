The function `func_4` takes a tree with `n` vertices, the number of vertices `n`, and an integer `k` as input, and returns the result of removing `k` edges from the tree, which is a connected graph with the specified vertices and edges. The function modifies the input tree by removing edges, resulting in a new state where the tree has `n` vertices and `n - 1 - k` edges.
