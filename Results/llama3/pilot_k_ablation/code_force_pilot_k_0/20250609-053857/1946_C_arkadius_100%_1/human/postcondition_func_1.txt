This function calculates the total number of good components and the total size of remaining components in the subtrees rooted at the children of a given vertex in a tree data structure. A good component is a subtree with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size. The function recursively traverses the subtrees, counting good components and accumulating the size of remaining components. It returns the total count of good components and the total size of remaining components.
