Output State: **t = 0, n = None, A = None**

After the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables `n` and `A` will be `None` because they are reassigned in each iteration of the loop and their values are not retained after the loop finishes.
