Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line contains 2n integers a_1,a_2,…,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first test case, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still contain two lines each, with the first line containing an integer n and the second line containing 2n integers.
