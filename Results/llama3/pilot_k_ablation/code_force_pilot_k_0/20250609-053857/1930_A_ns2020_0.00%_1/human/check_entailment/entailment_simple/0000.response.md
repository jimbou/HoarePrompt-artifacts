Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by summing up every other element in the sorted list of integers. However, the list of integers is not sorted in the program. The program assumes that the input list is already sorted, which is not guaranteed.

To achieve the maximum final score, we need to pair the smallest numbers together and the largest numbers together. This can be done by sorting the list of integers first. However, the program does not sort the list.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
