Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the line `print(sum(A[::2]))`. This line assumes that the smallest numbers will always be at even indices in the sorted array, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample is when the input is `n = 2` and the array is `[2, 1, 1, 2]`. The program will output `3` (sum of `2` and `1`), but the correct output should be `2` (sum of `1` and `1`).

The correct approach is to sort the array first and then sum the smallest `n` numbers. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = sorted(list(map(int, input().split())))
        print(sum(A[:n]))
        t = t - 1
```

This code first sorts the array in ascending order and then sums the smallest `n` numbers, which are the first `n` elements in the sorted array.
