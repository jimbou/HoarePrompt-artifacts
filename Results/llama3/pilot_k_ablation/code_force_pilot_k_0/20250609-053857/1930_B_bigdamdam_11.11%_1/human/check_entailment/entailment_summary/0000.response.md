Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required permutation pattern by first placing all even numbers from 2 to n in ascending order, followed by all odd numbers from 1 to n in ascending order. This pattern ensures that there are no two distinct indices i and j such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}, as required by the problem statement.

The program also correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases and the length of each permutation, and printing the rearranged permutations for all test cases.

Correctness: **True**
