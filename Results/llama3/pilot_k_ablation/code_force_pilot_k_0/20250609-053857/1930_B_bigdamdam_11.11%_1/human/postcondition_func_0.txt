The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the number of elements in a sequence. For each sequence, the function rearranges the numbers from 1 to n in a specific pattern, printing all even numbers from 2 to n followed by all odd numbers from 1 to n, and outputs the rearranged sequences for all test cases.
