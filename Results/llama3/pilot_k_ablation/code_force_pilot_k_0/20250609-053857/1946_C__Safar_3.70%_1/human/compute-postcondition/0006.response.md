Based on the precondition, we know that `l` is the smallest value such that `check(l)` returns `True`, and `r` is `l - 1`.

When the `print(r)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `r`, which is `l - 1`.

Since `l` is the smallest value such that `check(l)` returns `True`, we can infer that `l` is a value that satisfies some condition or property defined by the `check` function. However, the exact value of `l` is not specified.

Therefore, the output of the `print(r)` statement will be the value of `r`, which is one less than the smallest value `l` that satisfies the condition defined by the `check` function.

Output: **l - 1 (where l is the smallest value such that check(l) returns True)**
