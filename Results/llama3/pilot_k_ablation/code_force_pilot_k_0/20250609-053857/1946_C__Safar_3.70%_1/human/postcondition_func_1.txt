This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function explores the neighboring nodes of x that have not been visited, recursively calling itself on these nodes. It increments c by the sum of the values returned by the recursive calls for nodes with values less than y, and increments r by the sum of the values returned by the recursive calls for nodes with values greater than or equal to y. The function also adds x to the set of visited nodes. The final state of the program is a tuple containing the updated values of c and r, which represent the cumulative counts of nodes with values less than y and greater than or equal to y, respectively, in the subgraph rooted at x.
