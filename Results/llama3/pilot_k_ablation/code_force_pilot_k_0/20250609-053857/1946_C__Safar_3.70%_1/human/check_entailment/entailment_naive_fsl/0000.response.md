Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is a solution to the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It first constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges. Then, it defines a helper function `dfs` that performs a depth-first search on the tree, counting the number of nodes in each connected component and the number of edges that need to be removed to make each component have at least y nodes.

The `check` function uses the `dfs` function to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that each remaining connected component has at least x nodes. It clears the visited set, performs the DFS, and checks if the number of edges that need to be removed is greater than or equal to k.

The main function `func_1` performs a binary search on the possible values of x, starting from 1 and ending at n/k + 1. It uses the `check` function to check if the current value of x is possible, and updates the search range accordingly.

The program correctly implements the binary search approach and the DFS algorithm, and it correctly checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that each remaining connected component has at least x nodes.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
