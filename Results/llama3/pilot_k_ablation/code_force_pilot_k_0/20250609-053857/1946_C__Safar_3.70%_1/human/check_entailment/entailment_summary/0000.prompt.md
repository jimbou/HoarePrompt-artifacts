Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, k, edges):
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  This function constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree from a list of edges, then performs a binary search to find the smallest value that satisfies a certain condition (checked by the `check` function), and finally prints the value found. The function takes as input a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` such that `k < n`, and a list of pairs of integers representing edges in the tree. The function does not modify the input variables `n` and `k`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def dfs(x, y):
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            (ans, rn) = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
    return (c, r)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph, starting from a given node x, and returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. The function explores the neighboring nodes of x that have not been visited, recursively calling itself on these nodes. It increments c by the sum of the values returned by the recursive calls for nodes with values less than y, and increments r by the sum of the values returned by the recursive calls for nodes with values greater than or equal to y. The function also adds x to the set of visited nodes. The final state of the program is a tuple containing the updated values of c and r, which represent the cumulative counts of nodes with values less than y and greater than or equal to y, respectively, in the subgraph rooted at x.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
    if ans >= x and r >= k:
        return True
    return False
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  This function determines whether a given condition is met by performing a depth-first search (DFS) on a graph or tree structure. It takes a positive integer x and a non-negative integer k as input, and returns True if the DFS search yields values that satisfy the condition (ans >= x and r >= k), and False otherwise. The function also clears a visited set or list before performing the DFS search.
