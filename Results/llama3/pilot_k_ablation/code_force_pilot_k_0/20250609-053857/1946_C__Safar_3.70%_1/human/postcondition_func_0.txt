This function constructs an adjacency list representation of a tree from a list of edges, then performs a binary search to find the smallest value that satisfies a certain condition (checked by the `check` function), and finally prints the value found. The function takes as input a positive integer `n`, a non-negative integer `k` such that `k < n`, and a list of pairs of integers representing edges in the tree. The function does not modify the input variables `n` and `k`.
