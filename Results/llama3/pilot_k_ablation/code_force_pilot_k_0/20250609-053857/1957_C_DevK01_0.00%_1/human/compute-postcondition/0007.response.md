Output State: **The program returns the sum of the result of helper(len - 1) and 2 times (len - 1) times the result of helper(len - 2), where len is a non-negative integer larger than 0 and not in dp, and dp has a new entry with key len and value y.**

In this output state, the program returns the value of y, which is the sum of two components: x1 and x2. x1 is the result of the function helper called with the argument len - 1, and x2 is 2 times (len - 1) times the result of the function helper called with the argument len - 2. The value of len is a non-negative integer larger than 0 and is not present in the dictionary dp. Additionally, a new entry is added to dp with len as the key and y as the value.
