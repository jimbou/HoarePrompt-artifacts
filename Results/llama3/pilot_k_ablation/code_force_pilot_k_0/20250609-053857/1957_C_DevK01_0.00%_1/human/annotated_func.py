#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is an integer
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the result of the function helper(x), where x is an integer and dp is an empty dictionary. Since the function helper(x) is not defined in the given code, the output state will depend on the definition of this function. However, based on the initial state, we can say that the function helper(x) will be called with an integer value x and an empty dictionary dp.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function calls the helper function with an integer value x and an empty dictionary dp, and returns the result of this call. The specific actions performed by the function depend on the definition of the helper function, which is not provided. However, it is clear that the function takes an integer x as input and uses an empty dictionary dp in some way, ultimately returning a result that is determined by the helper function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer.
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer and len is larger than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value of dp at index len, where len is a non-negative integer greater than 0 and is an element in the collection dp.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer and len is larger than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns the sum of the result of helper(len - 1) and 2 times (len - 1) times the result of helper(len - 2), where len is a non-negative integer larger than 0 and not in dp, and dp has a new entry with key len and value y.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a value based on the input parameter 'len', which is a non-negative integer. If 'len' is 0 or less, the function returns 1. If 'len' is already present in the collection 'dp', the function returns the corresponding value from 'dp'. Otherwise, the function calculates the value using recursive calls to 'helper' and stores the result in 'dp' before returning it. The function effectively memoizes the results of 'helper' in 'dp' to avoid redundant calculations.
