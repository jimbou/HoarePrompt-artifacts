Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The problem description requires the program to consider the mirroring of moves by the computer and the fact that two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color. However, the provided program does not take these factors into account.

The program uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible configurations, but it does not consider the constraints imposed by the problem description. Specifically, it does not check if a move is valid by ensuring that it does not attack any other rook, and it does not account for the computer's mirroring of moves.

For example, if the input is n = 4 and k = 1, with the first move being (1, 2), the program will not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. The correct approach would be to consider the mirroring of the move by the computer, which would place a black rook at (2, 1), and then calculate the number of possible configurations from that state. However, the program does not do this, and instead simply calculates the number of possible configurations without considering the constraints imposed by the problem description.
