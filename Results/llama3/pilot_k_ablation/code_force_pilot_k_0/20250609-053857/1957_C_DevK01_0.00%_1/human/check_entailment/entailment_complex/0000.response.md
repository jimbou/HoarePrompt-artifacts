Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves.

The program first reads the input, which includes the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the k moves and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. If a move is not mirrored by the computer (i.e., r = c), the size of the chessboard is reduced by 1; otherwise, it is reduced by 2.

The program then calls the function `func_1` with the updated size of the chessboard as an argument. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, but based on the comments, it is clear that it calls the `helper` function with the updated size of the chessboard and an empty dictionary `dp`.

The `helper` function is defined in the code, and it correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible using dynamic programming. The function uses memoization to store the results of subproblems in the `dp` dictionary, which avoids redundant calculations and improves the efficiency of the program.

The `helper` function correctly handles the base case where the length is 0 or less, returning 1 in this case. For lengths greater than 0, the function recursively calculates the number of configurations possible by considering two cases: placing a white rook on the current row and column, and placing a black rook on the current row and column. The function correctly calculates the number of configurations possible in each case and returns the sum of these two cases.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves, and it uses dynamic programming and memoization to improve the efficiency of the calculation.
