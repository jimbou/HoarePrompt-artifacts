Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard, following certain rules. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `helper`, which work together to calculate the final configurations.

The `func_1` function takes an integer `x` as input and calls the `helper` function with `x` and an empty dictionary `dp`. The `helper` function calculates and returns a value based on the input parameter `len`, which is a non-negative integer. It uses memoization to store the results of previous calculations in the `dp` dictionary to avoid redundant calculations.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the final configurations by considering the number of valid moves remaining on the chessboard after `k` moves have been made. It correctly updates the number of valid moves based on whether the moves are mirrored by the computer or not.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
