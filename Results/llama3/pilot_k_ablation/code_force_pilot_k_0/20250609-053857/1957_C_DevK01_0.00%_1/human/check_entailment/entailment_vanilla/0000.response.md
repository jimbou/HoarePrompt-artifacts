Reasoning:

The problem is asking to determine the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The game is played on an n x n chessboard, where two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color. The computer mirrors the player's moves, and if the player places a rook on a position (r, c), the computer places a black rook at position (c, r) in its turn. If r = c, then the computer can't mirror the move, and skips its turn.

The given program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. Function 1, func_1(x), initializes a dictionary dp to store the results of subproblems and calls the helper function with the input x.

Function 2, helper(len), is a recursive function that calculates the number of different final configurations possible for a given length len. If len is less than or equal to 0, it returns 1, as there is only one possible configuration (no rooks on the board). If len is already in the dp dictionary, it returns the stored result. Otherwise, it calculates the result by recursively calling itself with len - 1 and len - 2, and stores the result in the dp dictionary.

The base cases for the recursion are when len is 0 or 1, in which case there is only one possible configuration. For len greater than 1, the function calculates the number of possible configurations by considering two cases: 

1. The player places a rook on a position (r, c) such that r != c. In this case, the computer will mirror the move, and the number of possible configurations is the same as if the player had placed a rook on position (c, r). This is represented by the term x1 = helper(len - 1).

2. The player places a rook on a position (r, c) such that r = c. In this case, the computer cannot mirror the move, and the number of possible configurations is twice the number of possible configurations for a board of size len - 2. This is represented by the term x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2).

The function returns the sum of x1 and x2, which represents the total number of possible configurations for a board of size len.

The program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, and the helper function correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for a given length.

Correctness: **True**
