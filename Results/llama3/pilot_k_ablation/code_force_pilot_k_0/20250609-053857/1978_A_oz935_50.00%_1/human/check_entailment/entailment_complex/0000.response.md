Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of pages `ls`.
3. It removes the last element from the list `ls` and stores it in the variable `last`. This is the largest element in the list, as the problem statement guarantees that the input is a list of distinct integers.
4. It sorts the remaining list `ls` in ascending order and removes the last element (which is now the second-largest element) and stores it in the variable `other`.
5. It prints the sum of `last` and `other`, which is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
