Reasoning:

The problem is asking us to determine the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The game starts with k moves already played, and we need to continue playing until there are no valid moves remaining.

The provided program uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It first initializes a dp array of size 300007 with -1, and then calls the func_1 function with the argument 300000. The func_1 function calculates the dp values for n = 1 to 300000.

In the main part of the program, it reads the number of test cases t, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard n and the number of moves already played k. It then reads the k moves and stores them in a set called invalid.

Finally, it prints the dp value for n - len(invalid), which represents the number of different final configurations possible.

The dp function is calculated as follows:

dp[1] = 1
dp[2] = 3
dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007

The dp function represents the number of different final configurations possible for an i x i chessboard. The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

For i >= 3, the dp function is calculated as the sum of two terms:

1. dp[i - 1]: This represents the number of configurations where the top-left corner of the chessboard is empty.
2. 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]: This represents the number of configurations where the top-left corner of the chessboard is occupied by a rook. There are i - 1 ways to place the rook in the top row, and for each of these ways, there are dp[i - 2] ways to place the remaining rooks.

The dp function is calculated modulo 1000000007 to avoid overflow.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible in the game.

Correctness: **True**
