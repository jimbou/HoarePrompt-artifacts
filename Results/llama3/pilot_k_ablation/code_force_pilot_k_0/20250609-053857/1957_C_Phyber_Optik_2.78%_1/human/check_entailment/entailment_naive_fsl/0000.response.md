Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is designed to calculate the number of different final configurations possible when playing a game of rooks on an n x n chessboard, where the computer mirrors the player's moves. The program uses dynamic programming to store the number of possible configurations for each board size from 1 to 300000.

The function `func_1(n)` calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n` by using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for a board of size `i`, the player can either place a rook in a new row and column (which gives `dp[i - 1]` possibilities), or place a rook in a row and column that already has a rook (which gives `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` possibilities).

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that would attack another rook), and then prints the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid moves.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when `r == c`), as it simply skips the computer's turn in this case.

The program also correctly handles the case where the player has already made `k` moves, as it calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid moves.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
