Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations for a given chessboard size `n` and number of moves `k`. The dynamic programming array `dp` is used to store the number of possible configurations for each board size from 1 to `n`.

The function `func_1(n)` calculates the values of `dp` for each board size from 1 to `n` using the recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. This recurrence relation is derived from the fact that for a board of size `i`, we can either place a rook in the first row (which gives `dp[i - 1]` possibilities) or place a rook in the first column (which gives `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]` possibilities, since we have `i - 1` choices for the row and `dp[i - 2]` choices for the remaining board).

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the number of invalid moves (i.e., moves that would attack an existing rook), and then prints the value of `dp[n - len(invalid)]`, which represents the number of possible final configurations for the given board size and number of moves.

The execution states of the program provided as comments show that the program correctly calculates the values of `dp` for each board size and prints the correct output for the given inputs.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
