Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the given problem. The dynamic programming approach used in the program is correct, and the base cases are properly handled. The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow.

The program first initializes the dp array with -1, and then calls the function func_1 to calculate the values of the dp array. The function func_1 calculates the values of the dp array using the recurrence relation dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007.

After calculating the values of the dp array, the program reads the input for the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard and the number of moves already played. It then calculates the number of invalid positions on the chessboard by adding the rows and columns of the moves already played to a set.

Finally, the program prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)] as the number of possible final configurations.

Correctness: **True**
