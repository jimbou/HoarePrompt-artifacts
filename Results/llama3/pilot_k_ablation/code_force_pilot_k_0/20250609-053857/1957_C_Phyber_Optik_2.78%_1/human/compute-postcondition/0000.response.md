Output State: **dp[1] is 1, dp[2] is 3, n is a non-negative integer.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning a value to a specific index of the `dp` list. The first line sets `dp[1]` to 1, and the second line sets `dp[2]` to 3. These assignments do not affect the value of `n`, which remains a non-negative integer. The final state includes the updated values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]`, as well as the unchanged value of `n`.
