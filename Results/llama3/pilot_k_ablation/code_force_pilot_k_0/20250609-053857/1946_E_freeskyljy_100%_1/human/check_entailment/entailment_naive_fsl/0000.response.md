Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly handles the cases where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not overlap, and it also correctly handles the cases where they do overlap. The program also correctly calculates the number of permutations that could have been guessed.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the number of permutations of a given length `n1` with `n2` fixed points. `func_2` calculates the number of permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program correctly checks for the conditions where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not overlap, and it returns 0 in such cases. It also correctly checks for the conditions where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums overlap, and it calculates the number of permutations that could have been guessed in such cases.

The program uses the modulo operator to avoid overflow, which is a good practice when dealing with large numbers.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and it should work correctly for all possible inputs.
