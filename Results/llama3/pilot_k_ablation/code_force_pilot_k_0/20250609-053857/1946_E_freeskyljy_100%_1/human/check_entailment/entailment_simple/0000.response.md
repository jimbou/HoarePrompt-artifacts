Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when the last element of the prefix maximums is not equal to the first element of the suffix maximums, when the first element of the prefix maximums is not equal to 1, when the last element of the suffix maximums is not equal to N, and when M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1 and the second last element of the prefix maximums is equal to the second element of the suffix maximums. The program also correctly calculates the result using the func_1 function and the product of the numbers from L[-1] - 1 down to 2 and from N - R[0] - 1 down to 1.

Correctness: **True**
