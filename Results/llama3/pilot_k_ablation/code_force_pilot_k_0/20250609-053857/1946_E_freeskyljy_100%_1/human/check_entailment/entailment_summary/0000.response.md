Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The function `func_1` calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, which is used in the main function `func_2` to calculate the final result.

The main function `func_2` first checks if the last element of the prefix maximums is equal to the first element of the suffix maximums, and if not, returns 0. This is because the last element of the prefix maximums and the first element of the suffix maximums must be the same in a valid permutation.

Then, it checks if the first element of the prefix maximums is 1 and the last element of the suffix maximums is N, and if not, returns 0. This is because the first element of the prefix maximums must be 1 and the last element of the suffix maximums must be N in a valid permutation.

Next, it checks if M1 is greater than 1, M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of the prefix maximums is equal to the second element of the suffix maximums, and if so, returns 0. This is because in a valid permutation, the second last element of the prefix maximums and the second element of the suffix maximums cannot be the same.

If none of these conditions are met, it calculates the final result using the function `func_1` and the product of certain numbers from the prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and returns this value modulo MOD.

The program correctly handles all the edge cases and calculates the correct result for the given input. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
