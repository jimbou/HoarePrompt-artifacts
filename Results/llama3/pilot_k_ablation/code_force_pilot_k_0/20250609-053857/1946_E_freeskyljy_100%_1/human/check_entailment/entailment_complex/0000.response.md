Reasoning: The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations and suffix/prefix maximums. It consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, where n1 and n2 are non-negative integers and n2 <= n1. `func_2` uses `func_1` to calculate a value based on the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, and R.

The program first checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and if not, returns 0. Then, it checks if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N, and if not, returns 0. Next, it checks if M1 is greater than 1, M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, and if so, returns 0. If none of these conditions are met, it calculates a value using `func_1` and the product of certain numbers from L and R, and returns this value modulo MOD.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the functions are correctly defined and used. The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when M1 or M2 is 1, or when the last element of L is not equal to the first element of R.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
