#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates a value based on the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, and R. It first checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and if not, returns 0. Then, it checks if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N, and if not, returns 0. Next, it checks if M1 is greater than 1, M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, and if so, returns 0. If none of these conditions are met, it calculates a value using the function func_1 and the product of certain numbers from L and R, and returns this value modulo MOD.
