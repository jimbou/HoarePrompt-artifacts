Output State: **N is an integer, M1 is an integer greater than 1, M2 is an integer, L is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, R is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, L and R are lists of distinct positive integers, L and R are sorted in ascending order, 1 <= L[0] <= N, 1 <= R[-1] <= N, 1 <= M1 <= len(L), 1 <= M2 <= len(R), MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. L[0] is equal to 1 and R[-1] is equal to N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or L[-2] is not equal to R[1]. ans is the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2. nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.**
