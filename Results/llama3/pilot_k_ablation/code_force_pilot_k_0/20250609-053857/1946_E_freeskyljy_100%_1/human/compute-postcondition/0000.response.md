Output State: **N, M1, and M2 are integers, L and R are lists of distinct positive integers, L and R are sorted in ascending order, 1 <= L[0] <= N, 1 <= R[-1] <= N, 1 <= M1 <= len(L), 1 <= M2 <= len(R), and MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of N, M1, and M2 are now integers, which were previously positive integers. The lists L and R are now populated with distinct positive integers, and they are sorted in ascending order. The constraints on the values of L[0], R[-1], M1, and M2 are still valid. The value of MOD remains unchanged as a positive integer. The stdin is now empty, as all the inputs have been read and assigned to the respective variables.
