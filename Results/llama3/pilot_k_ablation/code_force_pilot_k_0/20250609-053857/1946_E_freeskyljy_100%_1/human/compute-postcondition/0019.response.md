Postcondition: ***N, M1, and M2 are integers, L and R are lists of distinct positive integers, L and R are sorted in ascending order, 1 <= L[0] <= N, 1 <= R[-1] <= N, 1 <= M1 <= len(L), 1 <= M2 <= len(R), MOD is a positive integer. If M2 is greater than 1, then i is set to N, ans is set to (N - R[0] - 1)! % MOD, cur is set to M2, and nums_left is set to 0. Otherwise, if M1 is greater than 1, then i is set to 1, ans is set to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 1 down to 2 modulo MOD, cur is set to M1 - 2 - the number of elements in L that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to L[-1] - 1, and nums_left is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of i, ans, cur, and nums_left are not changed. In all cases, nums_left is also set to N - R[0] - 1.***
