Postcondition: ***N, M1, and M2 are integers, L and R are lists of distinct positive integers, L and R are sorted in ascending order, 1 <= L[0] <= N, 1 <= R[-1] <= N, 1 <= M1 <= len(L), 1 <= M2 <= len(R), and MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. L[0] is equal to 1 and R[-1] is equal to N.***
