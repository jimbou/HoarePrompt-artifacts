Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is an integer, M1 is an integer greater than 1, M2 is an integer, L is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, R is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, L and R are lists of distinct positive integers, L and R are sorted in ascending order, 1 <= L[0] <= N, 1 <= R[-1] <= N, 1 <= M1 <= len(L), 1 <= M2 <= len(R), MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. L[0] is equal to 1 and R[-1] is equal to N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or L[-2] is not equal to R[1]. ans is the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2. nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
