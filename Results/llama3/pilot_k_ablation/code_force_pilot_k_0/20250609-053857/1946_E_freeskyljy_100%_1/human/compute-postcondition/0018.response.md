Output State: **i = N, ans = (N - R[0] - 1)! % MOD, cur = M2, nums_left = 0**

In the output state, the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `N`, which is the upper bound of the loop. The variable `ans` has been updated to store the result of the factorial of `(N - R[0] - 1)` modulo `MOD`. The variable `cur` has been incremented to `M2`, which is the length of the list `R`. The variable `nums_left` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all numbers in the range `[R[0] + 1, N)` have been processed.
