Postcondition: **N, M1, and M2 are integers, L and R are lists of distinct positive integers, L and R are sorted in ascending order, 1 <= L[0] <= N, 1 <= R[-1] <= N, 1 <= M1 <= len(L), 1 <= M2 <= len(R), MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. L[0] is equal to 1 and R[-1] is equal to N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or L[-2] is not equal to R[1]. If M1 is greater than 1, then i is 1, ans is the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 1 down to 2 modulo MOD, cur is M1 - 2 - the number of elements in L that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to L[-1] - 1, and nums_left is 1. Otherwise, the values of i, ans, cur, and nums_left are not changed. nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. The current value of M2 is greater than 1.**
