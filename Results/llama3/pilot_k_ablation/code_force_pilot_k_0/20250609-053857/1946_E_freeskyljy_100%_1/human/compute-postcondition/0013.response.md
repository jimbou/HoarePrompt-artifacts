Output State: **i is 1, ans is the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 1 down to 2 modulo MOD, cur is M1 - 2 - the number of elements in L that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to L[-1] - 1, nums_left is 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable i is 1, the variable ans is the result of the function func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by the product of all numbers from L[-1] - 1 down to 2 modulo MOD, the variable cur is M1 - 2 minus the number of elements in L that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to L[-1] - 1, and the variable nums_left is 1.
