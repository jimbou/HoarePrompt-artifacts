Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3
6
1 1 4 5 1 4

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "NO" because the array cannot become non-decreasing after performing the operation any number of times.

However, the program has a logical error. The condition `check_all = all([a[0] > new[i] for i in range(len(new))])` is not sufficient to determine if the array can become non-decreasing. This condition only checks if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array, but it does not consider the relative order of the elements in the new array.

A correct solution would need to check if the new array is non-decreasing, not just if the first element of the original array is greater than all elements in the new array.
