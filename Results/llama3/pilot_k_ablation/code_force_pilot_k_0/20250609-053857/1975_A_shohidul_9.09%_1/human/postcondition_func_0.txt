This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'. If the list is not sorted, it checks if the list can be sorted by removing a prefix of elements. If such a prefix exists, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding 'YES' or 'NO' for each case.
