The code accepts an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and then a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6). Since `t` is assigned the first integer input, `t` is an integer between 2 and 50. The remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 50) and then a list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**
