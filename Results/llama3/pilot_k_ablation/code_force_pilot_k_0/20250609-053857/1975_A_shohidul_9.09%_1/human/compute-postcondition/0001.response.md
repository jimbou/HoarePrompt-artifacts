Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, indicating whether the input list of integers is sorted in ascending order or not. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed is equal to the value of 't', which is the number of test cases. The value of 't' remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop head and body. The input list of integers 'a' is also unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop. The variables 'n', 'check_all', 'new', 'check_all', and 'new_all' are local to the loop and do not affect the output state.**
