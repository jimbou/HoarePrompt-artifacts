Output State: **The output state will be a series of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. If n equals k, the sequence will be a series of 1s repeated n times. If k equals 1, the sequence will be a series of consecutive integers from 1 to n. If neither condition is met, the output will be -1. The number of lines will be equal to the value of t in the initial state.**
