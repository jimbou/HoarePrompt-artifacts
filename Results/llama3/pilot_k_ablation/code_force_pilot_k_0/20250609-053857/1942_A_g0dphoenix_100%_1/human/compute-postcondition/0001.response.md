Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates and prints a sequence of integers based on the values of n and k. If n equals k, the sequence is a series of 1s repeated n times. If k equals 1, the sequence is a series of consecutive integers from 1 to n. If neither condition is met, the function prints -1. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the corresponding sequences or -1 for each case.**
