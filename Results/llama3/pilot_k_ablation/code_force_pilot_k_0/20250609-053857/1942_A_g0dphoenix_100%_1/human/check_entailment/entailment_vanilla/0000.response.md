Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the number of test cases (t) using a for loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of n and k from the input.
3. If n is equal to k, it means that all cyclic shifts must be sorted. In this case, the program prints a string of '1's separated by spaces, with a total length of n. This is because an array of all '1's will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.
4. If k is equal to 1, it means that only one cyclic shift must be sorted. In this case, the program prints a string of numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces. This is because an array with numbers in ascending order will have only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
5. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions. In this case, the program prints -1.

The program's logic is correct because it covers all possible cases:

* If n == k, all cyclic shifts must be sorted, and an array of all '1's satisfies this condition.
* If k == 1, only one cyclic shift must be sorted, and an array with numbers in ascending order satisfies this condition.
* If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions, and the program correctly prints -1.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
