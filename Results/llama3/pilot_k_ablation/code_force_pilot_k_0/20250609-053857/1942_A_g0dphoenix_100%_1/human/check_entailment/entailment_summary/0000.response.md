Reasoning:

The given program is correct because it accurately implements the required logic to solve the problem. 

When n equals k, the program correctly prints a sequence of 1s repeated n times, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.

When k equals 1, the program correctly prints a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.

For all other cases, the program correctly prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
