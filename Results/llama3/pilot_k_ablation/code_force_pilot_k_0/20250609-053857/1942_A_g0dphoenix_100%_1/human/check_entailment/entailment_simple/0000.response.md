Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  If `n == k`, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. This is only possible when all elements of the array are equal. Therefore, the program correctly prints a sequence of 1s repeated `n` times.

2.  If `k == 1`, it means that exactly one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. This is possible when the array is a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the program correctly prints a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`.

3.  If neither `n == k` nor `k == 1`, it means that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions. In this case, the program correctly prints -1.

Therefore, the program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
