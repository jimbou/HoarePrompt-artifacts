Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = n - 1. In this case, the program should output a sequence of numbers that are all equal except for one number, which is larger than the rest. However, the program does not handle this case correctly.

For example, when n = 4 and k = 3, the program should output a sequence like [1, 1, 1, 2], but instead it outputs -1.

The program only handles the cases when k = n or k = 1, but it does not handle the case when k = n - 1, which is a valid case according to the problem description.
