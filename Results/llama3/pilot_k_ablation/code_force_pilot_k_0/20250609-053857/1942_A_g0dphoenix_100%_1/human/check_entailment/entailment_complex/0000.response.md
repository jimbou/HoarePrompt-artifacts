Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1. When `n == k`, it prints a sequence of 1s repeated `n` times, which satisfies the condition that all `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.

2. When `k == 1`, it prints a sequence of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted (the one starting from the smallest number).

3. When neither `n == k` nor `k == 1`, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The output format also matches the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
