This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, processes each test case by creating a list of integers and then answers queries about the list. For each query, it prints the value of the element at the specified index in the list if it is greater than or equal to a given value, otherwise it prints -1. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point it has read all input from standard input and has printed the results of all queries.
