stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, then an integer, and then multiple pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list. The second integer is the number of pairs. The pairs are such that the first integer of each pair is less than the second integer of the pair and both are less than or equal to the length of the list.
