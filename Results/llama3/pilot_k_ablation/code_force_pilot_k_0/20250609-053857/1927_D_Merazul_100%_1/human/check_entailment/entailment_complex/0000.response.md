Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a pair of different elements within a given range in an array. The program uses a clever approach to preprocess the array and store the indices of the last occurrence of a different element for each position in the array.

The program first reads the length of the array, the array itself, and the number of queries. It then preprocesses the array by iterating through it and updating the index of the last occurrence of a different element for each position.

When processing queries, the program simply checks if the index of the last occurrence of a different element for the given range is within the range. If it is, the program prints the index and the value at that index. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by preprocessing the array and using the stored indices to quickly answer queries.

Correctness: **True**
