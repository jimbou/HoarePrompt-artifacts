Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the array and keeps track of the last index where the value was different from the current value. This is done by updating the `j` variable whenever a new value is encountered. The `a` list is then used to store the last index where the value was different for each prefix of the array.

When a query is made, the program checks if the last index where the value was different is within the query range. If it is, it prints the indices `a[r]` and `r`. If not, it prints `-1 -1`.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the query range is the entire array, when the query range is a single element, and when the query range is a subset of the array.

The use of the `R` function to read input and the lambda function to simplify the code does not affect the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
