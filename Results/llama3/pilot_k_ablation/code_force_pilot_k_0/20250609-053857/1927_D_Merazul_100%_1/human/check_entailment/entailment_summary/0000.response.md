Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then enters a loop that runs `t` times.

2. Inside the loop, it reads the length of the array `n` (which is not used in the program), and then reads the array `a` itself.

3. It creates a new list `a` (overwriting the original array) where each element `a[i]` is the index of the first element in the original array that is different from the element at index `i`. This is done by iterating over the original array and keeping track of the last index `j` where the element was different from the current element.

4. Then it reads the number of queries `q` and enters another loop that runs `q` times.

5. Inside this loop, it reads the boundaries of the query `l` and `r`, and then checks if the element at index `r` in the new list `a` is greater than or equal to `l`. If it is, it prints the value of the element at index `r` in the new list `a` and the index `r` itself. Otherwise, it prints `-1` twice.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly finds the first pair of different elements in the array within the given range for each query, or reports that no such pair exists.

Correctness: **True**
