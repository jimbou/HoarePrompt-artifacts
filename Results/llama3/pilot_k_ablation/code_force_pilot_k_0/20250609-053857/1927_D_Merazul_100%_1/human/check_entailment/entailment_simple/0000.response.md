Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding a pair of different elements within a given range in an array. The program uses a clever approach to preprocess the array and store the indices of the last occurrence of a different element for each position in the array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the length of the array, the array itself, and the number of queries.
2. It initializes an array `a` with a single element 0, which will be used to store the indices of the last occurrence of a different element.
3. It iterates through the input array, keeping track of the last index `j` where the current element is different from the previous element `p`. It updates `j` whenever it finds a different element.
4. It appends the current index `i` to the array `a` if the current element is different from the previous element.
5. It reads the queries, which are pairs of integers `(l, r)`.
6. For each query, it checks if the index `a[r]` is less than `l`. If it is, it means that there is no pair of different elements within the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `-1 -1`.
7. If `a[r]` is not less than `l`, it means that there is a pair of different elements within the range `[l, r]`, so it prints the indices `a[r]` and `r`.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by preprocessing the array and storing the indices of the last occurrence of a different element. The use of the ternary operator `(j, i)[x != p]` is a clever way to update the index `j` whenever a different element is found.

Correctness: **True**
