Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three inputs: a list of integers, an integer, and multiple pairs of integers. The first integer is the length of the list. The second integer is the number of pairs. The pairs are such that the first integer of each pair is less than the second integer of the pair and both are less than or equal to the length of the list.**

The first line defines a lambda function `R` that takes no arguments and returns a map object of integers from the input. The second line uses this function to read the first integer from the input, which is the number of test cases, and assigns it to the variable `t`. This reduces the number of test cases in the input by one.
