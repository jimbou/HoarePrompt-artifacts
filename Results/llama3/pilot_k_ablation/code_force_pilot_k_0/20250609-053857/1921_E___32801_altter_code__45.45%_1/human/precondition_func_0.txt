stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b (1 ≤ x_a, x_b ≤ h ≤ 10^6, 1 ≤ y_a, y_b ≤ w ≤ 10^9) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips.
