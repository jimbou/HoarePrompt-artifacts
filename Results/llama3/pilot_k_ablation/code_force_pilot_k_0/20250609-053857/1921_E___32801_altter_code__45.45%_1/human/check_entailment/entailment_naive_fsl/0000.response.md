Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column and Alice is above Bob. In this case, the program should print "Alice" because Alice can move down and capture Bob's chip. However, the program prints "Draw" instead.

For example, if the input is:

10 10 2 5 5 5

The program will print "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice".
