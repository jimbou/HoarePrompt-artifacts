Output State: **The program returns nothing and 'Alice' is printed. The values of n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 remain unchanged as integers equal to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth input integers respectively. The list r still contains the six input integers. The difference between x2 and x1 is still an odd number, and x2 is still larger than x1. The values of y1 and y2 are still equal.**
