Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input integer, m is an integer equal to the second input integer, x1 is an integer equal to the third input integer, y1 is an integer equal to the fourth input integer, x2 is an integer equal to the fifth input integer, y2 is an integer equal to the sixth input integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, r is a list of six integers equal to the input values.**

In this output state, the variables n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2 have been assigned the values of the first six input integers, respectively. The variable r is a list containing these six input integers. Stdin now contains one less test case than initially, as one test case has been read and processed.
