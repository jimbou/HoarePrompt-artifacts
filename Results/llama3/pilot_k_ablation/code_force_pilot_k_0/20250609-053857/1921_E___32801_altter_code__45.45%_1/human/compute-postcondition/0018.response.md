Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on the positions of two chips, Alice's and Bob's, on a board. The function takes six integers as input: the dimensions of the board (h and w) and the initial positions of the chips (x_a, y_a, x_b, and y_b). It prints 'draw' if Bob's chip is not ahead of Alice's chip, 'Alice' if the difference between the x-coordinates of the chips is odd and the y-coordinates are equal, and 'Bob' if the difference between the x-coordinates is even and the y-coordinates are equal. In all cases, the function returns nothing.**
