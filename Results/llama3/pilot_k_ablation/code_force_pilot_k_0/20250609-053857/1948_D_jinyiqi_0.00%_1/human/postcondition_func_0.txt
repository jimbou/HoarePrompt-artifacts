This function determines the length of the longest substring with the same characters or '?' repeated twice in a given input string. It iterates through the string, comparing characters and counting consecutive matches or '?' characters. If a match of the desired length is found, it prints the length of the match multiplied by 2 and returns. If no such match is found after iterating through the entire string, it returns 0, indicating that no substring with the same characters or '?' repeated twice exists in the input string. The input string and its length remain unchanged throughout the process.
