Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat after replacing each question mark in the string with some lowercase Latin letter.

The program iterates through the string from the middle to the start, checking for consecutive matches or '?' characters. If a match of the desired length is found, it prints the length of the match multiplied by 2 and returns. If no such match is found after iterating through the entire string, it returns 0, indicating that no substring with the same characters or '?' repeated twice exists in the input string.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input string does not contain any tandem repeats by returning 0.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
