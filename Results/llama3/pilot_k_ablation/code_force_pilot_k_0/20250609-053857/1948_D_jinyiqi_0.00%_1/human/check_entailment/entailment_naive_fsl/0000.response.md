Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains only one character, which is a question mark. In this case, the program should return 2, because the question mark can be replaced with any lowercase Latin letter, and the resulting string is a tandem repeat of length 2. However, the program returns 0, because it only checks for tandem repeats of length greater than 1.

For example, if the input is "?", the program should return 2, but it returns 0.
