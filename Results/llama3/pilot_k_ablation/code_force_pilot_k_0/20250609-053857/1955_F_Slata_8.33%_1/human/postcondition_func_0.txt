The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of four integers. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of the four input integers by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 3 is equal to 3. The function processes all test cases and produces the corresponding output for each case.
