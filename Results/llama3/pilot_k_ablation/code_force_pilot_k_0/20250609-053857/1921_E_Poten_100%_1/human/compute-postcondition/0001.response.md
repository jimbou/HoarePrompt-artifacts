Output State: The variable 'answers' is a list of strings, where each string is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob', representing the outcome of each test case. The length of the list is equal to the initial value of 'test_cases'. The variable 'test_cases' remains unchanged. The stdin is empty, as all the test cases have been read and processed.
