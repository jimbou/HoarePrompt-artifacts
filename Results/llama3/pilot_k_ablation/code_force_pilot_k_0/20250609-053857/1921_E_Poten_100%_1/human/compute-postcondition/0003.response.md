Output State: The list "answers" remains unchanged, still populated with the results of the game for each test case, where each result is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The value of "test_cases" remains unchanged. The stdin is empty as all the test cases have been read. The loop has printed each result in the "answers" list to the console, one per line.
