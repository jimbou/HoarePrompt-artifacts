You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case consists of a single line containing six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b (1 <= x_a, x_b <= h <= 10^6, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w <= 10^9) — the dimensions of the board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It is guaranteed that either x_a != x_b or y_a != y_b.
    test_cases = int(input())
    answers = []
    for i in range(test_cases):
        clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
            answers.append('Draw')
        elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2] % 2 != 0 and clues[4
            ] % 2 != 0:
            if clues[3] == clues[5]:
                answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
                if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
            elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
                if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                    answers.append('Draw')
                else:
                    answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Alice')
        elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
            answers.append('Alice')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):

            else:
                answers.append('Alice')
        
    #State: The list "answers" is populated with the results of the game for each test case, where each result is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The value of "test_cases" remains unchanged. The stdin is empty as all the test cases have been read.
    for j in answers:
        print(j)
        
    #State: Output State: The list "answers" remains unchanged, still populated with the results of the game for each test case, where each result is either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'. The value of "test_cases" remains unchanged. The stdin is empty as all the test cases have been read.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
