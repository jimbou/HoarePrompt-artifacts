Output State: **test_cases is an integer between 1 and 10^4, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one line that was read to determine the number of test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which was read from the first line of stdin. The `answers` list is empty, as no elements have been added to it yet. Stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one line has been read to determine the number of test cases, so the number of lines in stdin has decreased by one.
