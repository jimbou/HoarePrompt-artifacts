This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of six integers representing the dimensions of a board and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. It then determines the winner of a game for each test case based on the positions of the chips and the dimensions of the board, and prints the result for each test case, which can be either 'Draw', 'Alice', or 'Bob'.
