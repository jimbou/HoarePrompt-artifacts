Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle all possible cases correctly. For example, when Alice's chip is in the first row and Bob's chip is in the last row, the program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game. 

In this case, the program checks if `clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1` and if this condition is true, it appends 'Draw' to the answers list. However, this condition does not cover all possible cases where Alice's chip is in the first row and Bob's chip is in the last row.

For instance, if the input is `10 10 1 5 10 5`, the program will incorrectly output 'Draw' instead of 'Alice'. This is because the program does not correctly check if Alice can win by moving her chip down and then diagonally to capture Bob's chip.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
