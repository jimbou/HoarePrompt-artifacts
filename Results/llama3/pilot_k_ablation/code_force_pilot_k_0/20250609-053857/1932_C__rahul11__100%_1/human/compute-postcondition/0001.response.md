Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers, and a string of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. It then processes the string in reverse order, calculating the product of the elements in the list at the indices specified by the string, modulo m, and outputs the results as a list of integers.**
