Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the commands in the string `s` in reverse order, calculates the product of the elements in the array `arr` at the specified indices modulo `m`, and outputs the results as a list of integers.

The program uses two pointers, `l` and `r`, to keep track of the current left and right indices of the array `arr`. It iterates over the string `s` in reverse order, and for each command, it updates the corresponding index and calculates the product modulo `m`.

The program also correctly handles the case where the product is zero, as it initializes the product `p` to 1 and updates it accordingly.

The output of the program matches the expected output for the given test cases, and the program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
