Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the string of commands in reverse order, calculates the product of the elements in the array at the specified indices modulo m, and outputs the results as a list of integers.

The program uses two pointers, l and r, to keep track of the current left and right indices of the array. It iterates over the string of commands in reverse order, updating the product p and the indices l and r accordingly. Finally, it outputs the list of products in the correct order by reversing the list ans.

The program handles the edge cases correctly, including the case where the array has only one element and the case where the string of commands is empty.

Correctness: **True**
