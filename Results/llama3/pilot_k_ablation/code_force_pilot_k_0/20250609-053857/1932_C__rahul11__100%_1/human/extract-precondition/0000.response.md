Precondition: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4), a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4), and a string s of length n consisting of 'L' and 'R' characters.**
