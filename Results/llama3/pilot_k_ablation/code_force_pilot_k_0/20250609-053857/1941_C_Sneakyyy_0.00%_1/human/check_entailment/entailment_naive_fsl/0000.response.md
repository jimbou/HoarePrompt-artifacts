Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input string is "mapmap", the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. This is because the program increments the index `i` by 3 when it finds a substring "map" or "pie", but it does not check if the next character is also part of a substring "map" or "pie". 

In the case of "mapmap", the program will find the first "map" and increment `i` by 3, but it will not find the second "map" because `i` is now pointing to the last character of the first "map". Therefore, the program will output 2 instead of 1.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the next character is also part of a substring "map" or "pie" before incrementing `i` by 3.
