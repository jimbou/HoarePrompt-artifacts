Reasoning:

The given program is designed to count the number of occurrences of the substrings 'map' and 'pie' in a given string. However, the problem statement requires the program to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, i.e., not contain the substrings 'map' or 'pie'.

The program's logic is to iterate over the string and check every 3-character substring. If the substring is 'map' or 'pie', it increments the counter and moves the index 3 positions forward. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index 1 position forward.

The issue with this approach is that it does not consider overlapping substrings. For example, if the string contains 'mapmap', the program will count it as two occurrences, but in reality, deleting one 'map' will make the string beautiful.

Moreover, the program does not consider the case where the string contains 'map' or 'pie' as a substring of a larger string. For example, if the string contains 'maple', the program will count it as one occurrence, but in reality, deleting one character will make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program's logic is incorrect, and it will not produce the correct output for all test cases.

Correctness: **False**
