Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. The string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
3. It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.
4. It uses a while loop to iterate over the string, checking every substring of length 3.
5. If the substring is "map" or "pie", it increments `ans` by 1 and moves the index `i` 3 positions forward.
6. If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it moves the index `i` 1 position forward.
7. After iterating over the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks substrings of length 3, but it does not consider the case where a character is part of both "map" and "pie". For example, in the string "mapie", the program would count the "p" in "map" and the "p" in "pie" separately, resulting in an incorrect count.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
