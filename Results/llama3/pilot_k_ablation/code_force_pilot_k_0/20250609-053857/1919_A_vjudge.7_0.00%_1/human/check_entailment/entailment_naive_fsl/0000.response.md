Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the winner of the game. The game's outcome depends on the sum of the coins in both wallets, not just the comparison of the number of coins in each wallet. The program does not take into account the fact that the player who has the opportunity to make the last move will win the game.

For example, if the input is (3, 4), the program will output "Alice", but the correct output should be "Bob". This is because the total number of coins is 7, which is odd, and Bob will have the opportunity to make the last move.

The correct solution should check if the sum of the coins in both wallets is odd or even, and output "Alice" if it's odd, and "Bob" if it's even.
