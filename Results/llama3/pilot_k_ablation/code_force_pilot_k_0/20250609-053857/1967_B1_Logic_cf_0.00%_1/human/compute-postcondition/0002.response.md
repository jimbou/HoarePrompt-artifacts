Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. For each test case, it calculates the sum of the number of multiples of each number from 1 to the minimum of n and m (inclusive), plus 1, and prints the result. The function consumes the input from stdin and produces a series of integers as output, one for each test case.**
