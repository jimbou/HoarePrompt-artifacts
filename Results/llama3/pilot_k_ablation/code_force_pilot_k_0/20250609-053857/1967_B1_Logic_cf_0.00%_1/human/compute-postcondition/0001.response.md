Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of integers, each representing the sum of the number of multiples of each number from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m` (inclusive), plus 1, for each test case. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the input from stdin is consumed.**
