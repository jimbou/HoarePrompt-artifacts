Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input (the number of test cases) to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line contains the number of test cases `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), we know that `t` will be an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

2. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. Therefore, the remaining stdin contains the test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each consisting of two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6).**
