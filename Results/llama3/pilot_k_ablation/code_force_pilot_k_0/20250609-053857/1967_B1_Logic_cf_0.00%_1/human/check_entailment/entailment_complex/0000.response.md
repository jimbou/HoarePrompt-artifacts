Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program is trying to calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions:

* 1 ≤ a ≤ n, 1 ≤ b ≤ m;
* a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

However, the program is not correctly implementing this logic. The program is simply calculating the sum of the number of multiples of each number from 1 to the minimum of n and m (inclusive), plus 1. This does not take into account the condition that a + b should be a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and b, and check if the conditions are satisfied. The program should also calculate the gcd of a and b, and check if a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).

Correctness: **False**
