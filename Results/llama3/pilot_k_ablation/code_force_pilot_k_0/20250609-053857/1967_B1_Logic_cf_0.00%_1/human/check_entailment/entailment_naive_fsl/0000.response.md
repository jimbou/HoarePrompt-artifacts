Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line `ans = ans + n // b + 1`. This line incorrectly assumes that for each value of b, there are n // b + 1 possible values of a that satisfy the conditions. However, this is not the case.

A counterexample is when n = 10 and m = 8. The program will output 15, but the correct answer is 14. The pair (10, 2) is counted twice, once for b = 2 and once for b = 1, but it should only be counted once.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to iterate over all possible values of a and b, and check if the conditions are satisfied. We can use the math.gcd function to calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b, and then check if a + b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b).
