Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by iterating over all possible values of `b` from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, and for each `b`, it adds `n // b + 1` to the answer.

However, this approach is incorrect. The condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)` is not being checked in the program. The program is simply adding `n // b + 1` to the answer for each `b`, which is not the correct way to count the number of ordered pairs that satisfy the given conditions.

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b`, and for each pair, check if `a+b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a,b)`. If it is, then increment the answer.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
