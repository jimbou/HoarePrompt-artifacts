Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when k is greater than 2n - 2. In this case, the program will print a value greater than n, which is not possible since we can color at most n cells.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 10, the program will print 6, but we can actually color only 5 cells to satisfy the condition.

The correct solution should handle this case separately and print the minimum number of cells that need to be colored, which is n in this case.
