Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in a square grid of size n x n, such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

The given program uses a simple and efficient approach to solve this problem. It first reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the square grid n and the minimum number of diagonals k.

The program then checks if k is even and if k/2 is odd. If both conditions are true, it prints k/2 + 1. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling of k/2.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

* If k is even, it means that we can color k/2 diagonals with one cell each, resulting in a total of k/2 colored cells.
* If k/2 is odd, it means that we need to color one additional diagonal with two cells, resulting in a total of k/2 + 1 colored cells.
* If k is odd, we can color (k-1)/2 diagonals with one cell each and the remaining diagonal with one cell, resulting in a total of (k+1)/2 colored cells. Since (k+1)/2 is the ceiling of k/2, the program prints the ceiling of k/2 in this case.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the minimum number of colored cells required for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
