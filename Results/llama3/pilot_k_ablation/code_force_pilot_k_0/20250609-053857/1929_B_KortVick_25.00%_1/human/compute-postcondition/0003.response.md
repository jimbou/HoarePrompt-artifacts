Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers: the size of a square grid and the minimum number of diagonals that should contain at least one colored cell. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of colored cells required for each test case, with the output being a series of integers, one per test case. The function consumes the contents of standard input and leaves the value of the number of test cases unchanged.**
