Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 10^8, 1 <= k <= 4n - 2) â€” the size of the square grid and the minimum number of diagonals in which there should be at least one colored cell.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first line of the input, which is between 1 and 1000. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed. The remaining lines contain two integers `n` and `k` each, where `n` is between 2 and 10^8, and `k` is between 1 and 4n - 2.
