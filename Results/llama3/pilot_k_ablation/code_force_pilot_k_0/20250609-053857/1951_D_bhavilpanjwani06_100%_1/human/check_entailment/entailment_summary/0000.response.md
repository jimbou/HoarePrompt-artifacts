Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether Alice can buy the desired number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of ways to do so if possible.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If Alice has fewer coins than the desired number of jewels, it's impossible for her to buy the desired number of jewels, so the program prints 'NO'.

2. If Alice has exactly the desired number of coins, she can buy one jewel from a stall with a price of 1, so the program prints 'YES' and the number of ways to do so (1).

3. If Alice has more coins than the desired number of jewels, the program checks if the difference between the number of coins and the desired number of jewels is less than the difference between the number of coins and the desired number of jewels plus one. If this condition is true, it means that Alice can buy the desired number of jewels by first buying jewels from a stall with a price of `n - k + 1` and then buying one jewel from a stall with a price of 1. So, the program prints 'YES' and the number of ways to do so (2).

4. If none of the above conditions are true, it's impossible for Alice to buy the desired number of jewels, so the program prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct result.

Correctness: **True**
