Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels with her n coins. The program uses a greedy approach, where Alice buys as many jewels as possible from each stall before moving on to the next one.

The program first checks if Alice has enough coins to buy k jewels (n >= k). If not, it prints 'NO'. If Alice has exactly k coins, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy all k jewels.

If Alice has more coins than k, the program checks if k - 1 is less than n - k + 1. This condition ensures that Alice can buy k - 1 jewels from the first stall and still have enough coins to buy 1 jewel from the second stall. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls: the first with a price of n - k + 1 and the second with a price of 1. This allows Alice to buy k - 1 jewels from the first stall and 1 jewel from the second stall, totaling k jewels.

If the condition k - 1 < n - k + 1 is not true, the program prints 'NO', indicating that it is impossible for Bob to set up his store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
