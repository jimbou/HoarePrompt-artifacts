Postcondition: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, and the number 1 is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, and `k - 1` is less than `n - k + 1`, 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and this is printed: `n - k + 1` and 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
