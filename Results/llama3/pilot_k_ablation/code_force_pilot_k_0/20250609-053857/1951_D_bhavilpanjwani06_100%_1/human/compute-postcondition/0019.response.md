Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. n is larger than or equal to k and n is not equal to k. The current value of k minus 1 is less than the current value of n minus k plus 1., 'YES' is printed, and the number 2 is printed, and this is printed: n - k + 1 and 1**
