Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) — the number of test cases. Each of the following t-1 lines contains two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18) — the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to have bought at the end. n is larger than or equal to k. The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed, and the number 1 is being printed**
