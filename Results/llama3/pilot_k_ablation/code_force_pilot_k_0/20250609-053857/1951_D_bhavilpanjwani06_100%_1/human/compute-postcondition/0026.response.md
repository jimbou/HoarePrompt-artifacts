Functionality: **Determines whether Alice can buy the desired number of jewels with her coins and prints the result along with the number of ways to do so if possible.**

This function takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants her to buy, respectively. It then checks the following conditions:

1. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'.
2. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' and '1'.
3. If `n` is greater than `k` and `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'YES', '2', and the values `n-k+1` and '1'.
4. If `n` is greater than `k` but `k-1` is not less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO'.

The function effectively determines whether Alice can buy the desired number of jewels with her coins and provides the result along with the number of ways to do so if possible.
