Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by initializing an empty array `a` and an empty dictionary `b`. It then reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It then initializes an array `a` with a single element `0` and an empty dictionary `b`.
3.  The program then iterates over each operation. If the operation is of type 1 (appending an integer), it increments the last element of array `a` by 1 and stores the appended integer in dictionary `b` with the current length of `a` as the key. If the operation is of type 2 (appending copies of the array), it appends a new element to array `a` which is the product of the current last element and the number of copies plus 1.
4.  After all operations are processed, the program reverses array `a` to maintain the correct order of lengths.
5.  The program then reads the queries and applies a function `func_1` to each query. The function `func_1` takes a query `x` and returns the `x-th` element of the final array.
6.  The function `func_1` works by first checking if `x` is directly available in dictionary `b`. If not, it iteratively applies the modulo operation with the lengths in array `a` until it finds a length that is present in dictionary `b`.
7.  Finally, the program prints the results of the queries for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
