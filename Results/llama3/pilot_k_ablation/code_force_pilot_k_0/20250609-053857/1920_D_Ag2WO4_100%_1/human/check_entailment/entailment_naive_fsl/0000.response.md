Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query index is larger than the current size of the array after the operations. In this case, the program should return the element at the index modulo the current size of the array, but the program does not do this.

For example, if the operations are:

1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3

And the query is 20, the program will return 1, but the correct answer is 3.

The program also does not correctly handle the case when the query index is 1, it should return the first element of the array, but the program returns the last element of the array.

And the query is 1000000000000000000, the program will return an incorrect answer because it does not handle the case when the query index is larger than the current size of the array.
