Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of finding the k-th element of array a after performing a series of operations. The program uses two lists, a and b, to keep track of the size of the array and the elements appended to the array, respectively.

The program first reads the number of operations and queries, and then reads the operations and queries. For each operation, it updates the size of the array and appends the element to the array if the operation is of type 1. If the operation is of type 2, it updates the size of the array by multiplying it by the number of copies.

After reading all the operations, the program reverses the list a and defines a function func_1 that takes an integer x as input. The function first checks if x is in the dictionary b, and if so, returns the corresponding element. If not, it iterates through the list a, updating x by taking the modulus of x with the current element in a and adding 1. If x is found in b during any iteration, it returns the corresponding element from b.

Finally, the program reads the queries, applies the function func_1 to each query, and prints the results.

The program appears to be correct in its approach to solving the problem. It correctly updates the size of the array and appends elements to the array based on the operations. The function func_1 correctly finds the k-th element of the array by iterating through the list a and updating x until it finds a match in the dictionary b.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program. The program assumes that the input is valid and does not handle cases where the input is invalid. For example, if the input contains an operation of type 2 before an operation of type 1, the program will not work correctly. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the size of the array exceeds 10^19.

Overall, the program appears to be correct in its approach to solving the problem, but it could be improved by adding error handling and bounds checking.

Correctness: **True**
