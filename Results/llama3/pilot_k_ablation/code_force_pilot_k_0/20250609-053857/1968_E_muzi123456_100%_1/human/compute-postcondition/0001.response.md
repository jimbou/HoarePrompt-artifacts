Output State: **The output state is a sequence of numbers printed to the console, where each number is repeated twice, followed by a space, and the sequence is repeated for each input number n. If n is 3, the sequence is 3 3 2 2 1 1, otherwise, it is n n n-1 n-1 ... 2 2 1 1.**

In natural language, the output state is a sequence of repeated numbers, where each number is printed twice, followed by a space. The sequence is repeated for each input number n. If n is 3, the sequence is a special case, where the numbers 3, 2, and 1 are printed twice each. For all other values of n, the sequence starts with n, followed by n-1, n-2, ..., 2, and 1, with each number printed twice.
