This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) specifies the number of subsequent integers (n) to process. For each n, it prints a sequence of numbers to the console, repeating each number twice, starting from n and decrementing to 1. If n is 3, the sequence is 3 3 2 2 1 1; otherwise, it follows the pattern n n n-1 n-1 ... 2 2 1 1. The function processes all input numbers specified by t, printing the sequences for each n.
