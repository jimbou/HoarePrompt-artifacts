Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then iterates through each test case.

For each test case, the program reads an integer n, representing the size of the grid. It then prints the coordinates of n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the coordinates of the points. It first prints the coordinates of the top-right and top-left corners of the grid (n, n) and (n, n-1). Then, it prints the coordinates of the remaining points in a diagonal pattern, starting from the top-left corner and moving down to the bottom-right corner.

The program handles the special case where n is 3 separately, as the diagonal pattern does not work for this case. Instead, it prints the coordinates of the points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), which maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances for n = 3.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem. It uses a simple and intuitive approach to generate the coordinates of the points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
