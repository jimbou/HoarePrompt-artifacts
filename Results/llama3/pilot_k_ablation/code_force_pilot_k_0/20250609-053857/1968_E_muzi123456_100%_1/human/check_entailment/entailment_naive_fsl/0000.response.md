Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program outputs:

4 4
4 3
1 1
1 1

However, this is not a valid solution because it does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. A correct solution for n = 4 would be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

This solution has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances, which is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The program's output for n = 4 does not achieve this optimal solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not work correctly for all potential cases.
