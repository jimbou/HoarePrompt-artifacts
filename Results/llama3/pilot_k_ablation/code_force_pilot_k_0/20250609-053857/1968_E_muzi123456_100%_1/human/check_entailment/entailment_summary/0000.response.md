Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints a sequence of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is achieved when the points are placed in a specific pattern. The pattern is such that the points are placed in a diagonal line from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner of the grid, with the first point at the top-right corner and the last point at the bottom-left corner.

The program implements this pattern by printing the points in the following order:

* For n = 3, the points are (3, 3), (2, 2), and (1, 1).
* For n > 3, the points are (n, n), (n, n-1), (n-1, n-1), ..., (2, 2), (1, 1).

This pattern ensures that the Manhattan distance between any two points is unique, maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly implements this pattern and prints the points in the correct order for each input value of n.

Correctness: **True**
