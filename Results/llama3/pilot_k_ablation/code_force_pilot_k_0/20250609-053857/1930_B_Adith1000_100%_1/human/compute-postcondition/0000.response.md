Output State: **The output state will contain multiple lines, each representing the modified list 'a' for each test case. The list 'a' will have its elements rearranged such that the first half of the list contains the numbers from 1 to n/2 in ascending order, and the second half contains the numbers from n/2 + 1 to n in descending order. If the length of the list is odd, the middle element will be n/2 + 1.**
