Functionality: **Rearranges the elements of a list from 1 to n in a specific order for multiple test cases. For each test case, it takes an integer n as input, creates a list of numbers from 1 to n, and then rearranges the list such that the first half contains numbers from 1 to n/2 in ascending order, and the second half contains numbers from n/2 + 1 to n in descending order. If the length of the list is odd, the middle element is set to n/2 + 1. The modified list is then printed as output for each test case.**
