Output State: `t` is 0, stdin contains no input.



The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, and the stdin remains unchanged as it contained no input initially. The function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times, but since its effects are not specified, the output state only reflects the changes to the loop variable `t`.
