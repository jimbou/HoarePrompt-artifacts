Functionality: **The function generates a permutation of length n, where the first k elements are filled in an alternating pattern of increasing and decreasing values, and prints the permutation as a string of space-separated values. The function takes two space-separated integers n and k as input from stdin, where 2 <= k <= n <= 2*10^5 and k is even. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the resulting permutation.**
