Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1` generates a permutation of length n, where the first k elements are filled in an alternating pattern of increasing and decreasing values. This pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1, satisfying the condition for a k-level permutation.

Function `func_2` reads an integer t from standard input, which represents the number of test cases. It then executes `func_1` t times, each time generating a k-level permutation of length n.

Since `func_1` correctly generates a k-level permutation, and `func_2` executes `func_1` the correct number of times, the overall program is correct.

Note that the problem statement guarantees that such a permutation always exists given the constraints, so the program does not need to handle cases where no k-level permutation exists.
