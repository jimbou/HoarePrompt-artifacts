Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function 1 generates a permutation of length n, where the first k elements are filled in an alternating pattern of increasing and decreasing values. This pattern ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will differ by no more than 1, meeting the condition for a k-level permutation.

Function 2 reads an integer t from standard input and executes Function 1 t times. This allows the program to generate k-level permutations for multiple test cases.

Since Function 1 correctly generates a k-level permutation for a given n and k, and Function 2 correctly executes Function 1 for multiple test cases, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
