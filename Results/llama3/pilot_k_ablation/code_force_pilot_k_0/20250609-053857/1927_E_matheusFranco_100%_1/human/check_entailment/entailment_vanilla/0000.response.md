Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a k-level permutation of length n. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input values n and k, constructs the permutation, and prints the result. `func_2` reads the number of test cases t and calls `func_1` t times.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases t in `func_2`.
2.  For each test case, `func_1` is called, which reads the values of n and k.
3.  In `func_1`, an array `permutation` of size n is initialized with zeros.
4.  Two variables, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, are initialized to 1 and n, respectively. These variables will be used to fill the permutation array.
5.  The program then enters a while loop that runs k times. In each iteration, it fills the permutation array in a specific pattern.
6.  Inside the loop, another while loop is used to fill the permutation array. This loop starts from the current index `idx` and increments by k in each iteration.
7.  If `idx` is even, the value at the current index in the permutation array is set to `bottom_v`, and `bottom_v` is incremented. If `idx` is odd, the value is set to `top_v`, and `top_v` is decremented.
8.  After filling the permutation array, the program converts it into a string with spaces in between and prints the result.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem's requirements. It constructs a k-level permutation of length n by filling the permutation array in a specific pattern. The use of `bottom_v` and `top_v` ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Correctness: **True**
