Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value 'm' such that there exists a sequence 'c_1, ..., c_{k-1}' satisfying the given conditions. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value 'tar' that can be reached by iteratively guessing a value 'ind' up to 'k' times. The function 'func_1' correctly checks if a target value 'tar' can be reached by iteratively guessing a value 'ind' up to 'k' times. The program also handles the case where the user inputs 'n + 1', in which case it immediately returns False.

Correctness: **True**
