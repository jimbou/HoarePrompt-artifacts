Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = 1 and n is a large number. In this case, the program will enter an infinite loop in the while loop where it tries to find the maximum value of mx. This is because the condition x == n will never be true, and mx will keep increasing indefinitely.

For example, if n = 10000 and k = 1, the program will keep printing '? 1 10000' and increasing mx, but it will never break out of the loop. This will cause the program to exceed the query limit and receive a Wrong Answer verdict.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
