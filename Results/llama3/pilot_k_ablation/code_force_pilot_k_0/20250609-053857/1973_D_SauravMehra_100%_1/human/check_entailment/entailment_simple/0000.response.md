Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive problem described. The program first finds the maximum possible value of the product of the length and the maximum of each subarray by querying the function f(l, r) with increasing values of the maximum until it finds a value that results in a valid r. Then, it tries to find the largest possible value of the product that can be achieved by splitting the array into k subarrays by querying the function f(l, r) with decreasing values of the product until it finds a value that results in a valid split.

The function func_1(tar, k, n) checks if it is possible to split the array into k subarrays with a product of tar. It does this by querying the function f(l, r) with the current value of tar and checking if the resulting r is valid. If it is, it moves on to the next subarray. If it is not, it returns False. If it successfully splits the array into k subarrays, it returns True.

The program correctly handles the case where it is not possible to split the array into k subarrays with a positive product by printing '! -1' and checking the response. If the response is -1, it exits the program.

Correctness: **True**
