Output State: **it is a positive integer, ind is a positive integer, tar is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, n is a positive integer such that k <= n, it is a positive integer, ind is a positive integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of 'it' and 'ind' has changed. 'it' is now a positive integer, and 'ind' is also a positive integer. The values of 'tar', 'k', and 'n' remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
