Functionality: **This function determines whether a target value 'tar' can be reached by iteratively guessing a value 'ind' up to 'k' times, where 'ind' is a positive integer less than or equal to 'n'. It returns True if 'ind' equals 'n' and the number of iterations 'it' equals 'k', and False otherwise. The function also handles the case where the user inputs 'n + 1', in which case it immediately returns False.**
