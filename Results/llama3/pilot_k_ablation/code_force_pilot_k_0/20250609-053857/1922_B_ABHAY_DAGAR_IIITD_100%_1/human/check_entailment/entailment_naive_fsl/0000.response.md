Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the line `ans += hashing[a[i]]`. This line only considers the cases where the current stick and the next stick have the same length, but it does not consider the cases where the current stick and the next two sticks have the same length.

For example, if the input is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`, the program will only count the combinations where the first two sticks have the same length, but it will not count the combinations where the first three sticks have the same length.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of three sticks, not just the cases where two consecutive sticks have the same length. We can use a different approach, such as using a hash map to count the frequency of each stick length, and then calculating the number of combinations of three sticks using the formula for combinations.
