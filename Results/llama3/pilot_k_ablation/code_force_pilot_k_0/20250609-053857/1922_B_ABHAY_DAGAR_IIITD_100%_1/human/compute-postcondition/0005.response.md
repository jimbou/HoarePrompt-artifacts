Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then sorts the integers and calculates the sum of the indices of the first occurrence of each duplicate element in the sorted array. The function returns the sum of these indices for each test case, printing the results to standard output.**
