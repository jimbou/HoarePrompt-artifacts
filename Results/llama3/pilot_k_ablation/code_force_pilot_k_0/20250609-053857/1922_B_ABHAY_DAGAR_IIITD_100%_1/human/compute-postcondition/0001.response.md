Output State: The loop has executed t times, and the results list contains t integers, each representing the sum of the indices of the equal elements in the sorted array a for each test case. The current_index has moved t * (n + 1) positions forward in the data list, where n is the maximum number of elements in a test case. The stdin remains empty, and the values of t and data remain unchanged.
