stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n and then n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n. t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 3 * 10^5, and the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. a_i is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n.
