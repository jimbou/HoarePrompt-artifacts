Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, t is an integer equal to the first input integer.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `t`. Since stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case having two inputs, the first input integer is assigned to `t`. After this line executes, stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case is processed, so we say it contains multiple test cases minus one test case. No other variables are affected.
