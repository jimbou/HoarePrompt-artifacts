Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The median is the middle value in the sorted array. If the array has an odd length, the median is the middle value. If the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle values.

The given program sorts the array and finds the median. It then counts the number of occurrences of the median value in the sorted array, starting from the median index to the end of the array. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

*   If the median is unique (i.e., it appears only once in the array), increasing it by 1 will increase the median.
*   If the median appears multiple times in the array, increasing all occurrences of the median by 1 will increase the median.

The program correctly implements this approach by sorting the array, finding the median, and counting the number of occurrences of the median value.

Correctness: **True**
