Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the number of lines to print for that test case. The function then prints a series of lines to standard output, where each test case consists of t*(n+1) lines. The first two lines of each test case are always "1 1" and "1 2", followed by n-1 lines of the form "i i", where i ranges from 3 to n+1. The function does not return any value, but instead modifies the standard output.**
