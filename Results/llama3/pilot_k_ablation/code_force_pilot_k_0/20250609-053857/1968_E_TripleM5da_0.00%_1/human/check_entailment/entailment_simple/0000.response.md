Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of n cells in the grid, which are chosen to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The coordinates are printed in the format "x y", where x and y are the row and column indices of the cell, respectively.

The program uses a simple strategy to choose the cells. It first prints the coordinates of the cell at position (1, 1), and then the coordinates of the cell at position (1, 2). For the remaining cells, it prints the coordinates of the cells on the diagonal of the grid, starting from the top-left corner and moving down to the bottom-right corner.

The program's strategy is correct because it ensures that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is unique. The Manhattan distance between two cells (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is given by |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By choosing cells on the diagonal of the grid, the program ensures that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is equal to the difference between their row indices plus the difference between their column indices. This means that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is unique, and therefore the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
