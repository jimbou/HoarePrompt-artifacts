Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

The program only prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all values of n, and then prints the points (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n + 2. This does not guarantee that the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is maximized.

A correct solution would involve a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the specific value of n and maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.
