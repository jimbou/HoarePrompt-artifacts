Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by printing out a set of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program is not correctly implementing the logic to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The program is simply printing out a set of points without considering the actual Manhattan distances between them.

2. The program is not handling the case when n is greater than 2 correctly. The program is printing out points (1, 1) and (1, 2) for all values of n, which is not correct.

3. The program is not printing out the correct number of points. The program is printing out n+1 points for all values of n, which is not correct.

4. The program is not correctly handling the case when n is equal to 2. The program is printing out points (1, 1) and (1, 2), but it should be printing out points (1, 1) and (2, 1) or (1, 2) and (2, 2).

5. The program is not correctly handling the case when n is equal to 3. The program is printing out points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3), but it should be printing out points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1).

6. The program is not correctly handling the case when n is greater than 3. The program is printing out points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n+1, but it should be printing out points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
