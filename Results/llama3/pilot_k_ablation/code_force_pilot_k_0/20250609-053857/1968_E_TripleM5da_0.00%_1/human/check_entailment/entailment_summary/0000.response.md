Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints a series of lines to standard output, where each line represents a cell in the grid.

The program starts by printing the first two lines as "1 1" and "1 2", which corresponds to the cells (1,1) and (1,2) in the grid. Then, it enters a loop that prints the remaining n-2 lines, where each line is of the form "i i", with i ranging from 3 to n+1.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program has a logical error. The loop should iterate from 3 to n (inclusive), not n+1. This is because the problem statement specifies that the Manhattan distance between cells (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) equals |x1-x2|+|y1-y2|, and the program's current implementation would result in Manhattan distances that exceed the maximum possible value of n-1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
