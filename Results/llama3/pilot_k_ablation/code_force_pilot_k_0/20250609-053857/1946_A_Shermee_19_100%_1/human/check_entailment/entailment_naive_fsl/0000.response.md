Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the solution to the problem. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases `t`, the length of each array `n`, and the array elements `a`.
2. It then defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of test cases as input. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a`.
3. Inside the `func_1` function, it iterates over each test case. For each test case, it sorts the array `a` in ascending order.
4. It then calculates the median index `median_index` using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`, where `n` is the length of the array.
5. The program then finds the median value `median_value` by accessing the element at the median index in the sorted array.
6. It initializes a variable `operations` to 0, which will store the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
7. The program then enters a while loop that continues until it has checked all elements in the array that have the same value as the median. In each iteration, it increments the `median_index` and increments the `operations` counter.
8. Finally, the program appends the `operations` value to the `results` list and returns the list.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. It handles all possible cases, including arrays with distinct and non-distinct elements, and arrays of different lengths.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the input data and the results.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem.
