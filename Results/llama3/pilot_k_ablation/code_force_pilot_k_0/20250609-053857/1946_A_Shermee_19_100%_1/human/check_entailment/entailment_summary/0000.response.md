Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The program sorts the array, finds the median index, and then counts the number of elements that are equal to the median value. This is because increasing any of these elements by 1 will increase the median. The program returns the count of these elements as the minimum number of operations required.

Correctness: **True**
