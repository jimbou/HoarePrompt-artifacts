This function calculates the number of operations required to find the median value for each test case in a given list of test cases. It takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a list containing an integer n and a list of n integers. The function sorts each list of integers, finds the median value, and counts the number of operations required to find the median value. The function returns a list of operation counts, one for each test case, while leaving the original list of test cases unchanged.
