Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic to determine whether Stepan can send all messages without the possibility of charging the phone. The program iterates through each message, calculates the energy cost of keeping the phone on or turning it off and on, and updates the remaining energy accordingly. If the remaining energy is insufficient to cover the energy cost, the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'YES' if `possible` is `True` and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the energy cost of keeping the phone on is less than or equal to the energy cost of turning it off and on, and when the remaining energy is insufficient to cover the energy cost.

Correctness: **True**
