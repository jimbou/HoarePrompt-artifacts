Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It iterates through the array of message sending moments, calculates the time difference between each moment, and determines the energy cost of keeping the phone on or turning it off and on. It then updates the remaining energy and checks if it's sufficient to send the next message.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If the initial energy is not sufficient to send the first message, it correctly returns 'NO'.
* If the energy cost of keeping the phone on is less than the energy cost of turning it off and on, it correctly chooses the former.
* If the energy cost of turning the phone off and on is less than the energy cost of keeping it on, it correctly chooses the latter.
* If the remaining energy is not sufficient to send a message, it correctly returns 'NO'.
* If the program can send all messages without running out of energy, it correctly returns 'YES'.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the initial energy is 0 or when the energy cost of keeping the phone on is equal to the energy cost of turning it off and on.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and I couldn't find any case where it doesn't work as expected.
