#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1}.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: The loop has executed all the iterations, and the output state is a list of 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case, indicating whether it is possible to keep the device on for the given time intervals with the available energy. The value of 't' remains unchanged, and the input from stdin has been consumed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. The function then determines whether it is possible to keep a device on for the given time intervals with the available energy, based on the energy costs of keeping the device on or turning it off and on. For each test case, the function prints 'YES' if it is possible to keep the device on and 'NO' otherwise. The function consumes all input from standard input and leaves the value of 't' unchanged.
