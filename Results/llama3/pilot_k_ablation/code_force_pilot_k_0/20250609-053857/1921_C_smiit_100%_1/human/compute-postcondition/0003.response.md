Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line contains four integers: n, f, a, and b, and the second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. The function then determines whether it is possible to keep a device on for the given time intervals with the available energy, based on the energy costs of keeping the device on or turning it off and on. For each test case, the function prints 'YES' if it is possible to keep the device on and 'NO' otherwise. The function consumes all input from standard input and leaves the value of 't' unchanged.**
