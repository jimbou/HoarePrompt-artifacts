Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1}.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b, where n is a positive integer, and f, a, and b are positive integers. The second line of each test case contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, where m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1}.
