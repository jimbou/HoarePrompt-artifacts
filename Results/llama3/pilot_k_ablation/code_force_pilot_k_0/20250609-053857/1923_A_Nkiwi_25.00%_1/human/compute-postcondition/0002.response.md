Functionality: **This function takes a series of test cases as input, where each test case consists of a list of binary digits (0s and 1s). It then calculates and prints the minimum number of zeros that need to be moved to create a contiguous block of zeros and ones, or the number of zeros in the test case if the first element is 1. The function processes multiple test cases and outputs the result for each case.**
