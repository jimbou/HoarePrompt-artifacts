Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

5
1 0 1 0 1

The program will output 2, but the correct answer is 2. However, the program does not consider the case where there are multiple blocks of 1's separated by 0's. In this case, the program will not correctly count the number of operations needed to move the 1's to form a single block.

For instance, if the input is:

9
0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0

The program will output 3, but the correct answer is 3. However, the program does not consider the case where there are multiple blocks of 1's separated by 0's. In this case, the program will not correctly count the number of operations needed to move the 1's to form a single block.

A correct solution would need to consider all possible cases, including multiple blocks of 1's separated by 0's.
