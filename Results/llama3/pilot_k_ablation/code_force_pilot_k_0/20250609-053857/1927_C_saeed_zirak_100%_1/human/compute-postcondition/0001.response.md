Functionality: **The function reads input from the standard input, processes it, and prints a series of 'yes' or 'no' to the console, each corresponding to a test case. The function determines whether it is possible to make two sets have exactly k/2 ones in common by adding or removing elements, and prints 'yes' if possible and 'no' otherwise. The input state remains unchanged.**
