Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of 'yes' or 'no' printed to the console, each corresponding to a test case. The 'yes' indicates that it is possible to make the two sets a and b have exactly k/2 ones in common by adding or removing elements, and 'no' indicates that it is not possible. The input state remains unchanged, with the same values for t, n, m, k, a, and b.**
