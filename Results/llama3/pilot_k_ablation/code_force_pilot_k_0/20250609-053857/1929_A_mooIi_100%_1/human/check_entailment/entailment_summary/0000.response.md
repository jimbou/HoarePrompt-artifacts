Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements.
3. It sorts the array elements in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension.
5. It prints the calculated sum for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array, which is the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. The sorting step is crucial, as it ensures that the differences are calculated between adjacent elements in ascending order, resulting in the maximum possible beauty.

Correctness: **True**
