Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the array elements. It then sorts the array elements in ascending order.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array can be obtained by arranging the elements in ascending order. This is because the difference between consecutive elements is maximized when the elements are in ascending order.

The program then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension. This is done by subtracting each element from its previous element (ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) and summing up the results.

Finally, the program prints the calculated sum for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it appears that the program is correct. The program correctly reads the input, sorts the array elements, calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
