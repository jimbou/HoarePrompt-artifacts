Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The program handles all possible cases, including when the input array has duplicate elements or when the array has only two elements. The program also correctly handles the case when the input array has only one element, in which case the beauty of the array is 0.

The program uses a list comprehension to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is a concise and efficient way to perform this calculation. The program also uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the input array, which is a efficient way to sort the array.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly implements the problem description.
