Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array (n) and the array elements themselves. The array elements are sorted in ascending order using the `sorted` function.

The program then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension. This is done by subtracting each element from its previous element (i.e., `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]`) and summing up these differences.

The key insight here is that the maximum beauty of the array is achieved when the elements are sorted in ascending order. This is because the differences between consecutive elements are maximized when the elements are in increasing order.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum beauty of the array for each test case and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
