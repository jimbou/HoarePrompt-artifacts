Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program sorts the array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

3. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array. By sorting the array in ascending order, it ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty.

4. The program also correctly handles the input and output formats as specified in the problem description.

5. There are no syntax errors or logical errors in the program.

Correctness: **True**
