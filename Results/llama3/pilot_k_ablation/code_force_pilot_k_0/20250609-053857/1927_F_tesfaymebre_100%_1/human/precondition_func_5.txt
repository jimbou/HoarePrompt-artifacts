n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The function func_3() returns a tuple of two integers, and the function DSU(n+1) returns a DSU object. The graph is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges, and there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices. The graph does not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not necessarily connected.
