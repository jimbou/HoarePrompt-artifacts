Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve a problem involving finding a simple cycle in an undirected weighted graph with the minimum-weight edge. The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific purpose.

Function 1-5 are used for reading input from the standard input, and they work as expected based on their output hints.

Function 6 is the core of the program, responsible for constructing the graph, finding the minimum-weight edge, and printing the shortest path between the two nodes connected by this edge. The function uses a disjoint set union (DSU) data structure to keep track of the connected components in the graph. It iterates over the edges in descending order of their weights and uses the DSU to check if adding an edge would form a cycle. Once it finds the minimum-weight edge that forms a cycle, it uses a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path between the two nodes connected by this edge.

Function 7 is the main function that executes `func_6()` a specified number of times, equal to the return value of `func_1()`.

Based on the provided execution summaries, all functions work as expected, and the program should correctly find and print the minimum-weight edge and the shortest path in the graph.

Correctness: **True**
