Output State: **The graph remains unchanged, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge in the graph, start and end are the two nodes of the minimum edge, que is a deque containing only the start node, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, and the other variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the code initializes a queue (que) with the start node and a dictionary (prev) to keep track of the previous node in the traversal, starting with the start node mapped to -1. The rest of the variables and the graph remain unchanged.
