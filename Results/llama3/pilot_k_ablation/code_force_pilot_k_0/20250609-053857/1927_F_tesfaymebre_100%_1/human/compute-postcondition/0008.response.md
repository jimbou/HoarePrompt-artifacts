Output State: **path is an empty list, curr is the end node, que is an empty list, prev is a dictionary containing all nodes in the graph except the end node, each mapped to its previous node in the shortest path from the start node to itself, and the other variables remain unchanged.**

In this code snippet, the first line initializes an empty list called `path`. The second line assigns the value of `end` to `curr`. Since `end` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a predefined variable or a constant. The `que` and `prev` variables, as well as the other variables, remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
