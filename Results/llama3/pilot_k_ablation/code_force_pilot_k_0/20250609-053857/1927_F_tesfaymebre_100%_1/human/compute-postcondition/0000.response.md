Output State: **`test_cases` is the return value of `func_1()`.**

The value of `test_cases` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_1()`. The initial state of `test_cases` being a positive integer is no longer valid, as its value is now determined by the return value of `func_1()`. The output state only includes the updated information about `test_cases`, as the other variables are not affected by the code.
