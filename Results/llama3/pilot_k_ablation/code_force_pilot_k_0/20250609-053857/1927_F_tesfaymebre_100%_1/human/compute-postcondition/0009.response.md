Output State: **path contains the shortest path from the start node to the end node in reverse order, curr is -1, and que remains empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that the path list now contains the shortest path from the start node to the end node in reverse order, the current node (curr) has reached the end node (-1), and the queue (que) remains empty.
