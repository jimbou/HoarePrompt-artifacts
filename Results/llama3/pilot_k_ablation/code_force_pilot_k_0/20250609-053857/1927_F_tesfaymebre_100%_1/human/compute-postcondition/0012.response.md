The code prints the elements of the `path` list in the reverse order of the shortest path from the start node to the end node.

Since the `path` list contains the shortest path in reverse order, reversing it again using `[::-1]` will give the original order of the shortest path from the start node to the end node.

Output: **the shortest path from the start node to the end node**
