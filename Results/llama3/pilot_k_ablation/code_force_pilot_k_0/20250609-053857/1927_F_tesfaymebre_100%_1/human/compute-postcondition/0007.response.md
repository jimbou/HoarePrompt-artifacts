Output State: **The loop ends with que being an empty list, prev being a dictionary containing all nodes in the graph except the end node, each mapped to its previous node in the shortest path from the start node to itself, and the other variables remaining unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is that the loop has finished executing, and the queue (que) is now empty. The previous node dictionary (prev) now contains all nodes in the graph except the end node, where each node is mapped to its previous node in the shortest path from the start node to itself. The other variables, such as the graph, edges, dsu, _min_edge, start, and end, remain unchanged.
