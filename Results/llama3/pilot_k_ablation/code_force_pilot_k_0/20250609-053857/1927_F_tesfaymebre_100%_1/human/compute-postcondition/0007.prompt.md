Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The graph remains unchanged, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge in the graph, start and end are the two nodes of the minimum edge, que is a deque containing only the start node, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, and the other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while que:
    node = que.popleft()
    if node == end:
        break
    for nei in graph[node]:
        if node == start and nei == end:
            continue
        if nei not in prev:
            prev[nei] = node
            que.append(nei)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
