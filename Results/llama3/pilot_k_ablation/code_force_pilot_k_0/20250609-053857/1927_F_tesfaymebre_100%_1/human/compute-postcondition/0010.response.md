Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `_min_edge` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the context, it is likely that `_min_edge` represents the minimum edge weight or cost in the shortest path from the start node to the end node.
* `len(path)` will print the length of the `path` list, which contains the shortest path from the start node to the end node in reverse order. Since the path is in reverse order, the length of the list will be equal to the number of nodes in the shortest path.

Considering the above points, the print statement will output the minimum edge weight or cost in the shortest path (represented by `_min_edge`) and the length of the shortest path (represented by `len(path)`).

Output: **_min_edge (the minimum edge weight or cost in the shortest path), len(path) (the number of nodes in the shortest path)**
