You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 3 <= n <= m <= min(n*(n-1)/2, 2*10^5). The function func_3() returns a tuple of two integers, and the function DSU(n+1) returns a DSU object. The graph is an undirected weighted graph with n vertices and m edges, and there is at most one edge between each pair of vertices. The graph does not contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). The graph is not necessarily connected.
    n, m = func_3()
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    edges = []
    for i in range(m):
        u, v, w = func_3()
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
        graph[v].append(u)
        
        edges.append((w, u, v))
        
    #State: Output State: The graph is a defaultdict of lists where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighbors, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight and the two nodes of an edge, and the other variables remain unchanged.
    edges.sort(reverse=True)
    dsu = DSU(n + 1)
    _min_edge = float('inf')
    start = -1
    end = -1
    for (w, u, v) in edges:
        parent_u = dsu.find(u)
        
        parent_v = dsu.find(v)
        
        if parent_u == parent_v:
            _min_edge = w
            start = u
            end = v
        else:
            dsu.union(u, v)
        
    #State: Output State: The graph remains unchanged, edges is an empty list, dsu is a DSU object where all elements are in the same set, _min_edge is the weight of the minimum edge in the graph, start and end are the two nodes of the minimum edge, and the other variables remain unchanged.
    que = deque([start])
    prev = {start: -1}
    while que:
        node = que.popleft()
        
        if node == end:
            break
        
        for nei in graph[node]:
            if node == start and nei == end:
                continue
            if nei not in prev:
                prev[nei] = node
                que.append(nei)
        
    #State: The loop ends with que being an empty list, prev being a dictionary containing all nodes in the graph except the end node, each mapped to its previous node in the shortest path from the start node to itself, and the other variables remaining unchanged.
    path = []
    curr = end
    while curr != -1:
        path.append(curr)
        
        curr = prev[curr]
        
    #State: path contains the shortest path from the start node to the end node in reverse order, curr is -1, and que remains empty.
    print(_min_edge, len(path))
    #This is printed: _min_edge (the minimum edge weight or cost in the shortest path), len(path) (the number of nodes in the shortest path)
    print(*path[::-1])
    #This is printed: the shortest path from the start node to the end node

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
