Functionality: **This function determines the minimum number of nodes in a graph with n nodes that must be connected to at least k other nodes, and returns this minimum number. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, the function returns 1, indicating that only one node needs to be connected to at least k other nodes. Otherwise, it returns n, indicating that all n nodes must be connected to at least k other nodes.**
