Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

The function `func_1(n, k)` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If it is, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the function returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1. In this case, the function returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `k` is 0 (no bridges are destroyed) and `k` is equal to `n-1` (all bridges connected to island 1 are destroyed).

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, in the first test case, `n` is 2 and `k` is 0, and the program correctly outputs 2, indicating that Everule can visit both islands. In the second test case, `n` is 2 and `k` is 1, and the program correctly outputs 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
