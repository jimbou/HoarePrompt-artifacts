#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer such that k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.
    if (k >= n - 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1.
    else :
        return n
        #The program returns a positive integer n.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the minimum number of nodes in a graph with n nodes that must be connected to at least k other nodes, and returns this minimum number. If k is greater than or equal to n-1, the function returns 1, indicating that only one node needs to be connected to at least k other nodes. Otherwise, it returns n, indicating that all n nodes must be connected to at least k other nodes.
