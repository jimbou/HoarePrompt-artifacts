Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^9), stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case. Each test case contains two space-separated integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the first integer from the first test case in the stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. Each remaining test case still contains two space-separated integers `a` and `b`, both between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).
