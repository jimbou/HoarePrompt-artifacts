Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.
2. If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or if `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.
3. In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because another rectangle can be formed.

This logic is correct based on the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
