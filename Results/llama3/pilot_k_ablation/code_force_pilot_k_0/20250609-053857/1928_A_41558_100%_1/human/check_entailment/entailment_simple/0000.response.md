Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks two conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.
2. If `a` is equal to `b` divided by 2 (or vice versa) and `b` (or `a`) is odd, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.

In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because another rectangle can be formed.

The program correctly handles the cases where `a` and `b` are equal, and where one is a multiple of the other. It also correctly handles the cases where `a` and `b` are both odd or both even.

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **True**
