Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a and b are both even numbers and a is not equal to b. In this case, the program will print 'YES', but it should print 'NO' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with the same size, and therefore, no other rectangle can be formed.

For example, if the input is 4 4, the program will print 'YES', but the correct output should be 'NO' because the 4x4 rectangle can be cut into two 2x4 rectangles, and from these, only the 4x4 rectangle can be formed, which is the same as the original rectangle.

The program only checks if a or b is odd, or if a is equal to 2b or b is equal to 2a, but it does not check the case when both a and b are even and a is not equal to b.
