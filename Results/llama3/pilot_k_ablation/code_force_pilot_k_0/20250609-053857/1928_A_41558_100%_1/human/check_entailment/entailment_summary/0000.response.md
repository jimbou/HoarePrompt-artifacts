Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a rectangle of size a x b can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The program correctly handles the cases where the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, i.e., when both a and b are odd (a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0). In this case, it prints 'NO'.

The program also correctly handles the cases where the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, but the resulting rectangles are the same as the original rectangle, i.e., when a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0. In this case, it prints 'NO'.

For all other cases, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and another rectangle can be formed from the two resulting rectangles.

Therefore, the given program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
