The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases), then for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string of 'W's and 'B's of the same length. Since the first input is an integer, it is consumed by `int(input())` and assigned to `t`. The remaining inputs are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (the number of test cases), stdin contains multiple inputs: for each test case, first an integer (the length of the strip) and then a string of 'W's and 'B's of the same length.**
