Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.

2. The given Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t`, and for each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip.

3. The program uses the `find()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, which represents the first black cell. It uses the `rfind()` method to find the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, which represents the last black cell.

4. The program calculates the minimum length of the segment to be repainted white by subtracting the index of the first black cell from the index of the last black cell and adding 1. This is because the indices are 0-based, and we need to include both the first and last black cells in the segment.

5. The program prints the minimum length of the segment for each test case.

Based on the above steps, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.

Correctness: **True**
