This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints output to standard output. It accepts a series of test cases, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m), an array of n integers (a), and a string of n characters (s). The function performs modular multiplication operations based on the input array and string, and prints the results as a string of integers separated by spaces. The output string is in reverse order of the input string. The function does not return any value, but instead prints the output directly to standard output.
