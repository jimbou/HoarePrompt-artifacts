Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the input array and string, performs the required modular multiplication operations, and prints the results in the correct order. The program uses a clever approach to handle the 'L' and 'R' commands by maintaining two pointers (q1 and q2) to traverse the array from both ends. The program also correctly handles the edge cases where the last command is 'L' or 'R'. The output is printed in the correct format, with the results in reverse order of the input string.

Correctness: **True**
