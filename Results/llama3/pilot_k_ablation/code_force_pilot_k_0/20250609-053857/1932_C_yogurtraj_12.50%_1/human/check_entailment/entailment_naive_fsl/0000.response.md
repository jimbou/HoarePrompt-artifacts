Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3 6
3 1 4
LRL

The program will output:

0 2 4

However, the correct output should be:

0 2 1

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when the command is 'L' and the leftmost element is removed. The program should multiply the product of the remaining elements by the removed element, but it does not do so correctly.

In the given example, after the first command 'L', the array becomes [1, 4] and the product is 4. After the second command 'R', the array becomes [1] and the product is 1. However, the program outputs 4 instead of 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
