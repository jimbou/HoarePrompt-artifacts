Output State: **The output state is a string of integers separated by spaces, where each integer is the result of a modular multiplication operation. The number of integers in the output string is equal to the number of test cases (t). Each integer is calculated by multiplying the corresponding element in the input array (a) with the previous result, modulo m, and the direction of the multiplication is determined by the corresponding character in the input string (s). The output string is in reverse order of the input string.**
