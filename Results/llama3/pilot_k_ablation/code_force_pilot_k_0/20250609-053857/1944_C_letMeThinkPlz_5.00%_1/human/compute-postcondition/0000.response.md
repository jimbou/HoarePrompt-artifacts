Output State: **`t` is an integer larger than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) and then a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer from stdin, which is larger than 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 1, since one test case has been read. Each remaining test case still contains two inputs: an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
