Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score, which is to choose the smallest available number that appears an odd number of times in the array. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1 to find the first number that appears an odd number of times or does not appear at all. If such a number is found, it is the maximum score that Alice can achieve.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array contains only one number, the program returns 0, which is the correct maximum score.
* When the array contains multiple numbers, the program returns the smallest number that appears an odd number of times or does not appear at all, which is the correct maximum score.
* When the array contains duplicate numbers, the program correctly counts the occurrences of each number and returns the correct maximum score.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or contains only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score.
