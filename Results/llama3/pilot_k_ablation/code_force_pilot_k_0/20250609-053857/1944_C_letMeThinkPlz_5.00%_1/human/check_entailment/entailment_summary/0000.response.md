Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score in the game. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the input list, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n to find the smallest number that is not present in the list or is present only once. This is the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob, as Alice should choose the smallest number that is not present in the list or is present only once to maximize the score, and Bob should choose the smallest number that is present in the list to minimize the score.

Correctness: **True**
