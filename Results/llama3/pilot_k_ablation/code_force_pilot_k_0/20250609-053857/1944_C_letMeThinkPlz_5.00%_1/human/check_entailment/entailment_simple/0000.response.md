Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
2.  It creates a dictionary `counter` to store the frequency of each number in the list.
3.  The program then iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (exclusive) to find the smallest non-negative integer that is not present in the list or appears only once. This is done by checking the frequency of each number in the `counter` dictionary.
4.  If a number is not present in the list (i.e., its frequency is 0), the program sets `ans` to that number and breaks the loop.
5.  If a number appears only once and the `once` flag is not set, the program sets `ans` to the next number (`i + 1`) and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can choose this number to maximize the score, and Bob cannot block it.
6.  Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the maximum score Alice can achieve.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for both players, as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
