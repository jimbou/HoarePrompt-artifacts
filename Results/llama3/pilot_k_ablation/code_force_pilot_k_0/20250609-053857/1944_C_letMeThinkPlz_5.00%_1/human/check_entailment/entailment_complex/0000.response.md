Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` integers.
2. It creates a counter dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer in the input list.
3. It then iterates through the range of possible integers (from 0 to `n-1`) and checks if the current integer is not present in the counter dictionary (i.e., its count is 0). If so, it sets the answer to the current integer and breaks the loop.
4. If the current integer is present in the counter dictionary but its count is 1, and the `once` flag is not set, it sets the answer to the current integer plus 1 and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can choose this integer, and Bob cannot choose it again, ensuring that the MEX of the resulting array is the current integer plus 1.
5. If the loop completes without finding a suitable answer, it means that all integers from 0 to `n-1` are present in the input list, and the MEX is therefore `n`.
6. The program prints the answer for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the `once` flag is crucial to ensure that Alice can choose an integer that appears only once in the input list, which is a key insight in solving this problem.

Correctness: **True**
