Reasoning:

The given program is designed to decode a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm replaces each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a string of distinct letters in alphabetical order. The decoding process involves reversing this operation.

The function `func_1` takes an encoded string as input and performs the following steps:

1. It extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order to form the string `r`.
2. It creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reverse order of `r`.
3. It uses this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding character in the reverse order of unique characters, effectively decoding the string.

The program then appends the decoded string to the `results` list and prints all the decoded strings at the end.

Based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm. It correctly extracts the unique characters, creates the character mapping, and uses it to decode the string.

Correctness: **True**
