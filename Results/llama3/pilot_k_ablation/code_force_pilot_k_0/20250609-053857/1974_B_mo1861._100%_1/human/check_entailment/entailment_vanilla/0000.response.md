Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of decoding a string that was encoded using a specific algorithm. The algorithm involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric character from a string of distinct characters in alphabetical order.

The program first reads the input data, which includes the number of test cases and the encoded strings. It then defines a function `func_1` that takes an encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

The function `func_1` works as follows:

1. It extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order to create the string `r`.
2. It creates a dictionary `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is done by iterating over the characters in `r` and mapping each character to the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`.
3. It then uses the `char_map` to replace each character in the encoded string with its symmetric character, effectively decoding the string.

The program then applies the `func_1` function to each encoded string and stores the results in a list. Finally, it prints the decoded strings, one per line.

Based on the provided problem description and the given program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm and handles the input data as expected.

Correctness: **True**
