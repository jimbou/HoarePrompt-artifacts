Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string. Then, it creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character in the reverse order of `r`. Finally, it decodes the encoded string by replacing each character with its corresponding character in the `char_map`. The decoded string is then returned.

Correctness: **True**
