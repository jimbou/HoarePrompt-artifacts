Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The program first constructs the auxiliary string r by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string. Then, it creates a character mapping by pairing each character in r with its corresponding character in the reverse order of r. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct output for the given inputs. The execution summary also confirms that the program replaces each character in the input string with its corresponding character in the reverse order of unique characters from the input string, which is the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
