Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The program first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. This is done correctly using the `sorted(set(encoded))` expression.

2. The program then creates a character mapping `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is done correctly using the dictionary comprehension `{char: r[-i - 1] for (i, char) in enumerate(r)}`.

3. Finally, the program decodes the encoded string `b` by replacing each character with its symmetric character using the `char_map`. This is done correctly using the generator expression `char_map[char] for char in encoded`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* Strings with duplicate characters
* Strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order
* Strings of length 1
* Strings with all unique characters

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty, although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem statement.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
