Output State: **encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters, unique_chars is a sorted list of unique characters from encoded, r is a string of unique characters from encoded in reverse order, char_map is a dictionary mapping each unique character from encoded to its corresponding character in r, decoded is a string where each character from encoded is replaced by its corresponding character in r.**

In this final state, the value of `encoded` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `unique_chars` now holds a sorted list of unique characters from the string `encoded`. The variable `r` is a string containing the same unique characters as `unique_chars`, but in reverse order. The dictionary `char_map` maps each unique character from `encoded` to its corresponding character in `r`, effectively creating a mapping for decoding. Finally, the variable `decoded` contains the decoded string where each character from `encoded` is replaced by its corresponding character in `r`, according to the mapping defined in `char_map`.
