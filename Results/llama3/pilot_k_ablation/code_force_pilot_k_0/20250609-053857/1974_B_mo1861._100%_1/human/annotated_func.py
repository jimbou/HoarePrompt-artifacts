#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string where each character from the original encoded string is replaced by its corresponding character in the reverse order of unique characters from the encoded string.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces each character in the input string with its corresponding character in the reverse order of unique characters from the input string, returning the modified string.
