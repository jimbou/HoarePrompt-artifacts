This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: the number of boxes, the initial state of the boxes (as a string of '1's and '0's), and the desired state of the boxes (as a string of '1's and '0's). It then calculates and prints the minimum number of operations required to transform the initial state into the desired state for each test case.
