Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 10^9, x != y).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first line of the input, which is the number of test cases. The stdin now contains multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated integers x and y, where 0 <= x, y <= 10^9 and x != y. The values of x and y are not changed by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
