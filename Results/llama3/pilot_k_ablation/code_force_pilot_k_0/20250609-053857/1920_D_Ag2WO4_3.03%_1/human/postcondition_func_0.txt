This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first two integers represent the number of operations and queries, respectively. It then performs a series of operations based on the input list, modifying the value of x. The function returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the result of the operations performed on the initial value of x. The operations involve iterating through the input list, performing divisions and modulo operations, and updating the value of x based on certain conditions. The function returns the final value of b[x] after all operations have been performed.
