Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query index is equal to the length of the array after the last operation of type 2. In this case, the program should return the last element of the array, but instead, it will return an incorrect result.

For example, consider the input:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The array after the last operation is [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]. The query index 20 is equal to the length of the array, and the correct result should be 3, but the program will return an incorrect result.

This is because the program uses the modulo operator to find the index of the element in the array, but it does not handle the case when the query index is equal to the length of the array correctly.
