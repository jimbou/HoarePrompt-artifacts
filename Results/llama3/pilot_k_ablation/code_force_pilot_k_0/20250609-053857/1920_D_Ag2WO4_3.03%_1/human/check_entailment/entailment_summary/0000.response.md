Reasoning: 
The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly handles the two types of operations: appending an integer to the end of the array and appending x copies of the array to the end of the array. The program also correctly handles the queries by finding the k-th element of the array after all operations have been performed.

However, there are a few issues with the program. The function `func_1` is not defined in the correct scope, and the variable `r` is not defined anywhere in the program. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input is invalid (e.g., if the input contains non-integer values or if the number of operations or queries is negative).

Despite these issues, the program is generally correct and should produce the correct output for valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
