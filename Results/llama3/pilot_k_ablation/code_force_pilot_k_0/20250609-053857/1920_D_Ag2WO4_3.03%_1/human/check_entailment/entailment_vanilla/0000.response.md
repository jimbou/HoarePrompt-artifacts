Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by initializing an array `a` with two elements, both set to 0. This array is used to keep track of the size of the array after each operation. It also initializes an empty dictionary `b` to store the elements of the array.

2.  The program then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d` for each test case.

3.  It iterates over each operation, reading the type of operation `d` and the value `e`. If the operation is of type 1, it appends the value to the array and updates the size of the array in `a`. If the operation is of type 2, it updates the size of the array in `a` by multiplying the current size by `e + 1`.

4.  After all operations are processed, the program reads the queries and applies a function `func_1` to each query. This function takes a query `x` and finds the corresponding element in the array.

5.  The function `func_1` works by iterating over the sizes of the array stored in `a` in reverse order. If the query `x` is within the range of the current size, it returns the element at index `x` in the array. If `x` is greater than the current size, it takes the modulus of `x` with the current size and continues with the next size. This process continues until it finds the corresponding element.

6.  Finally, the program prints the results of the queries.

Based on the provided problem description and the given Python program, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
