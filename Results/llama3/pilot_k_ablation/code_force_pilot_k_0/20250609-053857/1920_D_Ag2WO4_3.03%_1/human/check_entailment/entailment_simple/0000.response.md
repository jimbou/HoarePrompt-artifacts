Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program maintains a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the values appended to the array. The program then uses these data structures to efficiently answer the queries.

The program handles the two types of operations correctly. For the first type of operation, it simply appends the value to the array and updates the size of the array. For the second type of operation, it updates the size of the array by multiplying the current size by the number of copies plus one.

The program also correctly handles the queries. It first checks if the query index is within the range of the array before the last operation of the second type. If it is, it simply returns the value at that index. If not, it calculates the remainder of the query index divided by the size of the array after the last operation of the second type, and then recursively finds the value at that index.

The program also correctly handles the case where the query index becomes zero after the division, in which case it returns the value at the last index of the array.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
