#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first two integers represent the number of operations n and the number of queries q, respectively. The next n integers represent the operations, where each operation is a pair of integers (b, x) as described in the problem statement. The last q integers represent the queries, where each query is an integer k as described in the problem statement.
    x = int(x)
    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is an integer representing the number of operations n and is the first element of the original list of integers.
    #State: *x is an integer, which is the first element of the original list of integers, representing the number of operations n. f is not equal to 0
    for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[2 * i] >= x:
            continue
        
        if a[2 * i + 1] < x:
            x %= a[2 * i + 1]
            if x == 0:
                return b[a[2 * i + 1]]
            if a[2 * i] >= x:
                continue
        
        return b[x]
        
    #State: x is the remainder of the division of the initial value of x by the smallest odd number in the list a that is greater than the initial value of x, or the value of b[x] if x becomes 0 after the division, or the value of b[a[2*i + 1]] if x is less than a[2*i + 1] and a[2*i] is greater than or equal to x.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first two integers represent the number of operations and queries, respectively. It then performs a series of operations based on the input list, modifying the value of x. The function returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the result of the operations performed on the initial value of x. The operations involve iterating through the input list, performing divisions and modulo operations, and updating the value of x based on certain conditions. The function returns the final value of b[x] after all operations have been performed.
