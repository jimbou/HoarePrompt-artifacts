Output State: **x is the remainder of the division of the initial value of x by the smallest odd number in the list a that is greater than the initial value of x, or the value of b[x] if x becomes 0 after the division, or the value of b[a[2*i + 1]] if x is less than a[2*i + 1] and a[2*i] is greater than or equal to x.**
