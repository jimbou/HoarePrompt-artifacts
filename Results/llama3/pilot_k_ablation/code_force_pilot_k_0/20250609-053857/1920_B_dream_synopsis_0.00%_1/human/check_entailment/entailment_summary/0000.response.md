Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice and Bob's game. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of elements (n), the number of elements to remove (k), and the parameter (x).
3.  It then reads the array of n integers and sorts it in descending order.
4.  The program calculates the sum of all elements in the array (sum1).
5.  It then iterates from 0 to k (inclusive) and calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by removing i elements and considering the parameter x. This is done by subtracting twice the sum of the x smallest elements (since Bob will multiply them by -1) and adding the i-th largest element (since Alice will remove it).
6.  The program stores these calculated sums in the list `ans`.
7.  Finally, it prints the maximum sum from the list `ans`, which represents the maximum sum that can be achieved by Alice and Bob playing optimally.

Correctness: **True**
