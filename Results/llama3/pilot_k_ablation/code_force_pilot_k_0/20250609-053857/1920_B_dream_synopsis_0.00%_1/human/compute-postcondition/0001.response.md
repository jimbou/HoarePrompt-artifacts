Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: the number of elements (n), the number of elements to remove (k), and a parameter (x). The second line contains n integers representing the elements of an array. The function sorts the array in descending order, calculates the sum of the array elements, and then iteratively calculates the maximum sum that can be obtained by removing k elements, considering the parameter x. For each test case, it prints the maximum sum that can be achieved.**
