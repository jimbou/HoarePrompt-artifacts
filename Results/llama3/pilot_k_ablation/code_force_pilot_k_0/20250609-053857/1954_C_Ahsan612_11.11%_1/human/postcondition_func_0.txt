This function takes an integer t as input, followed by 2t pairs of integers, each consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then generates two new integers for each pair, where the first integer has the maximum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers up to the middle, and the minimum digits after the middle. The second integer has the minimum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers up to the middle, and the maximum digits after the middle. The function prints these 2t pairs of new integers, with each pair on separate lines.
