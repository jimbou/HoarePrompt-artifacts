Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the length of the input integers is odd. In this case, the middle digit is not handled correctly. The program tries to divide the length of the input by 2 and use the result as the index to separate the first half and the second half of the digits. However, when the length is odd, this will cause the middle digit to be missed.

For example, if the input is x=123 and y=321, the program will output x=132 and y=213, which is not the correct result. The correct result should be x=321 and y=123.

The program should be modified to handle the case when the length of the input integers is odd. One possible solution is to add a special case to handle the middle digit when the length is odd.
