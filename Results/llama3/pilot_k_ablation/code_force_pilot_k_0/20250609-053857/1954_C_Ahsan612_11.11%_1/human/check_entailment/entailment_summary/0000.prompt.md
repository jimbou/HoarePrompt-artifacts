Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y of the same length, consisting of digits
from 1 to 9 .

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):
swap the i -th digit in x and the i -th digit in y .

For example, if x=73 and y=31 , you can swap the 2 -nd digits and get x=71 and
y=33 .

Your task is to maximize the product of x and y using the aforementioned
operation any number of times. If there are multiple answers, print any of
them.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer x (1 \le x <
10^{100} ).

The second line of each test case contains a single integer y (1 \le y <
10^{100} ).

Additional constraint on input: the integers x and y consist only of digits
from 1 to 9 .

Output

For each test case, print two lines — the first line should contain the number
x after performing the operations; similarly, the second line should contain
the number y after performing the operations. If there are multiple answers,
print any of them.

# Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = list(map(int, list(input())))
        b = list(map(int, list(input())))
        new = [None] * len(a)
        new2 = [None] * len(a)
        mid = len(a) // 2
        i = 0
        while i < mid:
            new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        while i < len(a):
            new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
            new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
            i += 1
        print(''.join((str(x) for x in new)))
        print(''.join((str(x) for x in new2)))





# Execution Summary:
This function takes an integer t as input, followed by 2t pairs of integers, each consisting of digits from 1 to 9. It then generates two new integers for each pair, where the first integer has the maximum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers up to the middle, and the minimum digits after the middle. The second integer has the minimum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers up to the middle, and the maximum digits after the middle. The function prints these 2t pairs of new integers, with each pair on separate lines.
