Output State: **The output state will contain 2t lines, where each pair of lines contains two integers of the same length as the input integers, consisting of digits from 1 to 9. The first integer in each pair will have the maximum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers up to the middle, and the minimum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers after the middle. The second integer in each pair will have the minimum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers up to the middle, and the maximum digits from the corresponding positions in the input integers after the middle.**
