Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input from stdin, including the number of test cases, the size of the array, the number of queries, the array elements, and the query ranges.
2.  It initializes two lists, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the array elements, respectively.
3.  The program then iterates over the array elements, updating the `ones` and `sum` lists accordingly.
4.  For each query, the program calculates the number of 1's and the sum within the query range using the `ones` and `sum` lists.
5.  It then checks the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` to determine if the subarray is good. This condition is based on the problem statement and is correct.
6.  Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the subarray is good and 'NO' otherwise.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. The use of the `ones` and `sum` lists to keep track of the cumulative count and sum is efficient and allows the program to answer queries in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
