Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly initializes the `ones` and `sum` lists to keep track of the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the input array `nums`, respectively.
2.  The program then iterates over the `q` queries. For each query, it calculates the number of 1's (`onesInRange`) and the sum of numbers (`sumInRange`) in the specified range `[l, r]`.
3.  The program checks the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` to determine if the subarray is good. This condition is derived from the problem constraints:

    *   `2 * onesInRange` represents the minimum sum required to make all 1's in the range greater than 1 (by adding 1 to each 1).
    *   `(r - l + 1) - onesInRange` represents the number of non-1 elements in the range.
    *   The condition checks if the sum of these two values is less than or equal to the actual sum of the range (`sumInRange`). If it is, then the subarray is good.

4.  The program prints 'YES' if the condition is met and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly implements the problem constraints and logic, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
