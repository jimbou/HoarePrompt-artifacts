Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. The program first calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum of the array. Then, for each query, it calculates the number of 1's and the sum within the query range. It checks if the condition 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange is met, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the subarray to be good. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program handles the case where the query range has only one element correctly by printing 'NO' immediately.

Correctness: **True**
