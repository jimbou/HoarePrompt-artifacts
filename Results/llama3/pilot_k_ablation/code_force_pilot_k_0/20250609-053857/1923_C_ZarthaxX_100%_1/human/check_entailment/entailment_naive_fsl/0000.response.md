Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions. It uses two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray, respectively. The program then checks if the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the subarray has only one element or where the subarray has no ones. The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the elements in the subarray is equal to the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, therefore the program is correct.
