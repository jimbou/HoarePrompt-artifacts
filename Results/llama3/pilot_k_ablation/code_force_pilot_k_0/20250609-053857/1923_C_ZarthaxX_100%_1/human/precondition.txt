stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: first an integer, then a list of integers, and then multiple queries, each query consisting of two integers. The first integer is the number of elements in the list. The second integer is the number of queries. Each element in the list is a positive integer. Each query consists of two integers, the start and end indices of a subarray (1-indexed).
