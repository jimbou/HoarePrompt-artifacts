Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output to stdout. It accepts no parameters and returns no values. The function reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and q, representing the size of an array and the number of queries, respectively. The function then reads n integers into an array and q pairs of integers representing query ranges. For each query range, the function calculates the cumulative count of 1's and the cumulative sum within the range and prints 'YES' if a certain condition is met, and 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for all test cases.**
