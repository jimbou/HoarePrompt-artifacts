Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, q is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, nums is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros.**

The code reads the first test case from stdin, assigning the values of n and q. It then reads n integers from stdin, storing them in the list nums. The code also initializes two lists, ones and sum, each containing n+1 zeros. The state of stdin is updated to contain t-1 test cases. The values of n, q, nums, ones, and sum are updated as described.
