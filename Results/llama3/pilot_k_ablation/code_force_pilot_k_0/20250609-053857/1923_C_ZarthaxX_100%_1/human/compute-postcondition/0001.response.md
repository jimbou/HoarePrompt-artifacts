Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the ones list contains the cumulative count of 1's in the nums list, and the sum list contains the cumulative sum of the nums list. The ones list at index i contains the number of 1's in the nums list from index 0 to i-1, and the sum list at index i contains the sum of the nums list from index 0 to i-1. The other variables, t, n, q, and nums, remain unchanged.
