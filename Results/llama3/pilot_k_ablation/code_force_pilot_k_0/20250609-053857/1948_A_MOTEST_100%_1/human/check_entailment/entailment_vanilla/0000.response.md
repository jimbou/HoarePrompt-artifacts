Reasoning:

1. The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

2. The program first clears the screen using `os.system('cls')`, which is not necessary for the problem but does not affect the correctness of the solution.

3. It then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.

4. For each test case, it reads the number of special characters `n` and checks if `n` is odd. If `n` is odd, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to build a string with an odd number of special characters.

5. If `n` is even, it initializes an empty string `ans` and a counter `x` to 0. It then enters a loop that runs `n // 2` times.

6. Inside the loop, it appends two occurrences of the `x`-th uppercase letter to `ans` and increments `x`. This effectively creates a string with `n` special characters.

7. After the loop, it prints 'YES' and the constructed string `ans`.

8. The program correctly handles the case where `n` is odd and prints 'NO' in this case.

9. The program also correctly constructs a string with `n` special characters when `n` is even.

10. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
