Reasoning:

The problem statement requires the program to output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. However, the annotated program prints the maximum of x and y followed by the minimum of x and y. This is the opposite of what the problem statement requires.

In the annotated program, the if-elif-else statement correctly determines the maximum and minimum of x and y, but the print statements are incorrect. For example, when a > b, the program prints a (the maximum) followed by b (the minimum), instead of printing b (the minimum) followed by a (the maximum).

Correctness: **False**
