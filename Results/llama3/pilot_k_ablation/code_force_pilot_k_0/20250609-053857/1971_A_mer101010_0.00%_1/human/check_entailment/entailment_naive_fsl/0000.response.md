Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to compare the values of x and y and prints the minimum followed by the maximum. The program handles all possible cases, including when x is greater than y, when x is equal to y, and when x is less than y.

The program also correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then reading two space-separated integers for each test case. The program uses the map function to convert the input strings to integers, which is a common and correct way to do this in Python.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.
