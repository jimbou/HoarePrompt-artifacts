The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), `n` becomes equal to `t`. The second line initializes `t` to 0.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
