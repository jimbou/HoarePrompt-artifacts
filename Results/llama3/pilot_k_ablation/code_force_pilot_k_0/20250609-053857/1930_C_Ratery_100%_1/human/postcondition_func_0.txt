This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n integers. It processes each test case by sorting the list in descending order, then generates a new list where each element is either the largest integer in the input list or one less than the previous element in the output list, whichever is smaller. The function prints the resulting list in ascending order, which has one more element than the input list.
