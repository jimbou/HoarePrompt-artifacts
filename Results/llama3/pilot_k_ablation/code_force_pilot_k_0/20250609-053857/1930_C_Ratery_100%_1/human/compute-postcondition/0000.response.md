Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer, arr is a sorted list of n integers in descending order, ans is a list containing the largest integer in arr.**

In this output state, stdin has been reduced by one test case, and n has been assigned the value of the first integer in the remaining test case. The list arr has been created by mapping the sum of the index and value of each integer in the list to the corresponding integer, then sorting the list in descending order. The list ans has been initialized with the largest integer in arr.
