Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array elements.
2. It calculates the sum of each element and its index (1-indexed) and stores it in the `arr` list. This is in line with the problem description.
3. The program sorts the `arr` list in descending order, which is necessary to find the lexicographically largest `b`.
4. The program initializes the `ans` list with the largest element of `arr`.
5. The program then iterates over the rest of the `arr` list. For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`. If it is, it appends `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`. Otherwise, it appends `x` to `ans`. This logic ensures that the `ans` list is constructed in a way that maximizes the lexicographical order.
6. Finally, the program prints the `ans` list, which represents the lexicographically largest `b`.

The output state of the program matches the expected output format, and the logic of the program is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
