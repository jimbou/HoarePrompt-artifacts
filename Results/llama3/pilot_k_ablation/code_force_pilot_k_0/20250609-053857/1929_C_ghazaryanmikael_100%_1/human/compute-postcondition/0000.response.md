Output State: **The output state will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, one for each test case. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed will be equal to the value of t in the initial state. Each 'YES' or 'NO' will indicate whether the value of a is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s for the corresponding test case.**
