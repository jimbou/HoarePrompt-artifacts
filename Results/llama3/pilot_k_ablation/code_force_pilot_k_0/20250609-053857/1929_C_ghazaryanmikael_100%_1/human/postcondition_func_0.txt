The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. For each test case, it calculates a value s based on the given formula and then prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, and 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for the number of test cases specified by the initial integer t, printing one 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case.
