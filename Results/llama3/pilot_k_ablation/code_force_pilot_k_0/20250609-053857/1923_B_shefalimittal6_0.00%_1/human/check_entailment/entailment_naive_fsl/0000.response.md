Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. In the given code, the function `func_1()` is supposed to determine whether it is possible to kill all monsters before they reach the character. However, the code does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple monsters at the same position.

In the given code, the line `b[abs(x)] += a[i]` adds the health of the monster to the list `b` at the index equal to the absolute value of the monster's position. This means that if there are multiple monsters at the same position, their health values will be added together in the list `b`. However, this is not correct because the problem statement allows firing bullets at different monsters, even if they are at the same position.

For example, consider the case when there are two monsters at position 1, one with health 2 and the other with health 3. The code will add their health values together in the list `b`, resulting in `b[1] = 5`. However, this means that the code will require 5 bullets to kill both monsters, which is not correct because it is possible to fire bullets at different monsters.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and the correctness is **False**.
