The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains one input: an integer (t) representing the number of test cases. After accepting the input, the stdin is now empty. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin is empty**
