You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, then a space-separated list of n integers, and then a space-separated list of n integers. n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, and the integers in the lists are non-negative integers.
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: Output State: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the sum of the ith element of a and the absolute value of the ith integer from the input.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: Output State: r is the sum of the differences between k and the sum of the ith element of a and the absolute value of the ith integer from the input, for all i from 1 to n, a is a list of n non-negative integers, b is a list of n+1 integers where the value at index i is the sum of the ith element of a and the absolute value of the ith integer from the input, n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer.
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the sum of the `i`th element of `a` and the absolute value of the `i`th integer from the input, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, or 'Invalid input format' is printed if the input is invalid.

```

Return Postconditions: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `i` is the sum of the `i`th element of `a` and the absolute value of the `i`th integer from the input, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed, or 'Invalid input format' is printed if the input is invalid.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
