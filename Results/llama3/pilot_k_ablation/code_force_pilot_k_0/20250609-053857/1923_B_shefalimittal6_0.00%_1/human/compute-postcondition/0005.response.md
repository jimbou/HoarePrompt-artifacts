The program could raise a `ValueError` if the input provided by the user cannot be converted to an integer. This could happen if the user enters a string, a float, or any other non-integer value.

The try-except statement accomplishes the following:

*   If the input is a valid integer, it reads the integer, assigns it to `t`, and then calls `func_1()` `t` times.
*   If the input is not a valid integer, it catches the `ValueError`, prints an error message 'Invalid input format', and does not call `func_1()`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases if the input is valid, otherwise, the state is unknown, and 'Invalid input format' is printed.**
