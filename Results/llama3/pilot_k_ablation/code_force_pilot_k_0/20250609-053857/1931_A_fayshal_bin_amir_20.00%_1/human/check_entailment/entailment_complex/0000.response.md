Reasoning:

The given program is designed to find the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by dividing the input integer into three parts, each representing the position of a letter in the alphabet.

The program correctly handles the cases where the input integer is less than or equal to 26, 27 to 52, and 53 to 78. For each case, it constructs the lexicographically smallest three-letter word by assigning the smallest possible values to the letters.

The program uses the `chr` function to convert the integer values to their corresponding lowercase alphabet characters. The `96` in the `chr` function is used to adjust the ASCII value of the characters, since the ASCII value of 'a' is 97.

The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors. It correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
