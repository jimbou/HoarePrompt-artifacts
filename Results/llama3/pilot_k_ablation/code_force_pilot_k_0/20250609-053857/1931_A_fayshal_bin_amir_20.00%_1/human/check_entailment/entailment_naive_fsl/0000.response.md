Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when the input is 4, the program outputs "aaz", but the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded is actually "aab". 

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle cases where the sum of the positions of the characters in the alphabet is less than 27. In such cases, the program should output a word with the first two letters being "a" and the third letter being the corresponding letter in the alphabet, but the program does not do this correctly.

For instance, when the input is 4, the program should output "aab", but it outputs "aaz" instead. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case where the sum of the positions of the characters in the alphabet is less than 27. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
