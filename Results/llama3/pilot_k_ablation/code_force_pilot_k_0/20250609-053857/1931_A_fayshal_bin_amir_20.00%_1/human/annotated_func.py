#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer such that 3 <= num <= 78.
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase alphabet character that corresponds to the integer value of num, where num is an integer between 1 and 26 (inclusive).
    #State: *num is an integer such that 27 <= num <= 78

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive) as input and returns a lowercase alphabet character if the input is between 1 and 26 (inclusive), otherwise it does not return any value for inputs between 27 and 78.
