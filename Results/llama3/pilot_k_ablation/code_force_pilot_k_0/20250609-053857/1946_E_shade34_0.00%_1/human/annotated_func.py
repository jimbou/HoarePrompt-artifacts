#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is non-zero.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1 and 0. The first value, 1, is an integer. The second value, 0, is also an integer and is equal to the current value of variable b.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns two values, `d` and `c`, which are the return values of the function `func_1(b, a)`, where `b` is a non-zero integer and `a` is an integer less than `b`.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0. a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negation of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. The difference between this integer and 1 is then negated, resulting in a negative integer or zero.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is non-zero, and b is not equal to 0. a is not less than b. a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The value of `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, where `a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is not less than `b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input, where b is non-zero. It returns a tuple of two values. If b is zero, it returns (1, 0). If a is less than b, it calls another function func_1 with b and a as arguments and returns the result. If a is a multiple of b, it returns (1, -(a // b - 1)). Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns a tuple containing one of the return values of func_1 and the difference between the other return value of func_1 and the product of a divided by b and the first return value of func_1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers, b is a prime number.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer `a` and `c` (which is the return value of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`) modulo 1000000007, where `b` is a prime number.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-negative integer `a` and a prime number `b` as inputs, calculates the product of `a` and the return value `c` of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, and returns the result modulo 1000000007.
