Correctness: **False**.

The program is missing the main logic to solve the problem. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be related to modular arithmetic, but they are not used to solve the problem of counting the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

The problem description requires the program to take the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums as input, as well as the indices of the prefix and suffix maximums. However, the provided code does not have any logic to process this input and calculate the correct output.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
