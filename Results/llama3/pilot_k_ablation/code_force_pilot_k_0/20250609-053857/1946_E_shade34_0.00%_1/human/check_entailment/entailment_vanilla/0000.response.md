Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse. This function is used to calculate the modular inverse of a number, which is necessary for the modular arithmetic operations in the problem.

`func_2` uses the result from `func_1` to perform a modular multiplication.

However, there is no main function or code that actually solves the problem. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` are not being used to calculate the number of permutations. The program is incomplete and does not provide a solution to the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
