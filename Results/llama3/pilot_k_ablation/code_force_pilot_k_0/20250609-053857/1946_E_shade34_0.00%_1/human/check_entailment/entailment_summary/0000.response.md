Correctness: **True** 

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program first checks if the last prefix maximum is the same as the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, as there are no valid permutations.

If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums. For each suffix maximum, it calculates the number of combinations using the `func_2` function, which is a modular multiplicative inverse function. It then multiplies the result with the total number of permutations.

The `func_2` function is also correct. It uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number, and then multiplies the result with the input number `a`.

The `func_1` function is a recursive function that calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. It correctly handles the base cases and recursive calls.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums, and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct.
