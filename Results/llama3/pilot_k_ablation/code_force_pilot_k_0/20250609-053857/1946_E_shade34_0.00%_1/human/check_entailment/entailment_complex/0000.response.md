Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, modulo 10^9 + 7.

The program first initializes a list of factorials modulo 10^9 + 7, which is used later in the calculation. It then reads the input data, including the length of the permutation, the number of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, as well as the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, the program prints 0, indicating that there are no valid permutations.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of valid permutations using a combination of the factorial values and the indices of the prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The calculation involves iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums, and multiplying the result by the appropriate factorial values and indices.

The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to perform the calculations. func_1 is a recursive function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and func_2 uses the result of func_1 to calculate the modular inverse of a number.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
