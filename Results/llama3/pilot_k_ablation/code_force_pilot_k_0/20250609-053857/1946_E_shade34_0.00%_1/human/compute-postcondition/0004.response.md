Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is less than `b`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, with `a` still being less than `b` and `b` being non-zero. The code assigns the return values of the function `func_1(b, a)` to the variables `c` and `d`. The exact values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
