Output State: **The program returns the product of a non-negative integer `a` and `c` (which is the return value of `func_1(b, 1000000007)`) modulo 1000000007, where `b` is a prime number.**

In this output state, the value of `c` is determined by the function `func_1(b, 1000000007)`, which is not defined in the given code snippet. However, we know that `b` is a prime number, and the function `func_1` takes two arguments: `b` and `1000000007`. The result of this function call is multiplied by `a`, which is a non-negative integer, and then taken modulo `1000000007`. The final result is returned by the program.
