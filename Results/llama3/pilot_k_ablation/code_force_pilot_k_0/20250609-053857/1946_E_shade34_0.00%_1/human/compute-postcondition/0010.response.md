Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is not less than `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The code only assigns the return values of the function `func_1(b, a % b)` to the variables `c` and `d`. The conditions that `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not divisible by `b` are still valid, as the code does not change the values of `a` and `b`. The return values of `func_1(b, a % b)` are assigned to `c` and `d`, but their specific values are not determined without knowing the implementation of `func_1`.
