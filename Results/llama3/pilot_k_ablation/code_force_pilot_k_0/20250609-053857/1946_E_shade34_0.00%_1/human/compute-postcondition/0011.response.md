Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: `d` and `c - a // b * d`. `d` is one of the return values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c` is the other return value of `func_1(b, a % b)`. The value of `c - a // b * d` is calculated using the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, where `a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, `a` is not less than `b`, and `a` is not divisible by `b`.**
