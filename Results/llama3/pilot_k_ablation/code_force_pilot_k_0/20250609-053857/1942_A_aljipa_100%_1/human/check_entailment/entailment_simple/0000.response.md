Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input: it reads the number of test cases `t` and then for each test case, it reads the two integers `n` and `k`.

2. The program correctly handles the three possible cases for `k`:
   - If `k` is equal to `n`, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array should be sorted. This is only possible if all elements of the array are equal. Therefore, the program correctly outputs a list of `n` ones.
   - If `k` is equal to 1, it means that exactly one cyclic shift of the array should be sorted. This is possible if the array is a sorted list of distinct numbers. Therefore, the program correctly outputs a list of numbers from 1 to `n`.
   - If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, it means that there is no array that satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the program correctly outputs -1.

3. The program correctly prints the output: it uses the `print(*res)` statement to print the list of numbers.

Correctness: **True**
