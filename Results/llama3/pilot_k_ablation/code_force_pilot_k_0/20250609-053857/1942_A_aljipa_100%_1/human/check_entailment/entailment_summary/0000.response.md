Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

1. If k is equal to n, it generates a list of n ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the list are sorted.

2. If k is equal to 1, it generates a list of numbers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the list is sorted.

3. For all other cases, it generates a list containing a single -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the corresponding lists for each case.

Correctness: **True**
