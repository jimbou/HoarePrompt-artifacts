Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `k` is greater than 1 and less than `n`. In this case, the program outputs `[-1]`, which is incorrect. The problem statement requires the program to output an array of length `n` that satisfies the given conditions.

For example, when `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `[-1]`, which is incorrect. A correct output for this case would be an array of length 3 that has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

The program only handles the cases when `k` is equal to `n` or `k` is equal to 1, but it does not handle the cases when `k` is greater than 1 and less than `n`. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
