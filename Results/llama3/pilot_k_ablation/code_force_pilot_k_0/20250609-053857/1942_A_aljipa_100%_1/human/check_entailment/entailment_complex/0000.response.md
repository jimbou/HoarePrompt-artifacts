Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the required array based on the values of n and k.

The program first reads the number of test cases t from the standard input. Then, for each test case, it reads the values of n and k. Based on the values of k, the program generates the required array as follows:

- If k is equal to n, the program generates an array of n ones. This is because an array of all ones has all its cyclic shifts sorted.
- If k is equal to 1, the program generates an array of numbers from 1 to n. This is because an array of consecutive numbers has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).
- If k is neither equal to n nor 1, the program generates an array containing a single -1. This is because it is not possible to have exactly k sorted cyclic shifts for any array when k is neither equal to n nor 1.

The program then prints the generated array for each test case.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, it is clear that the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
