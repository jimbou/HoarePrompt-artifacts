Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for multiple test cases. The program reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y, and prints the minimum and maximum of these two integers.

The program uses the built-in min() and max() functions in Python, which correctly find the minimum and maximum of two integers, respectively. The program also uses a for loop to iterate over the test cases, which is correct.

The program's logic is straightforward and correct. It reads the input, processes it, and prints the output as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
