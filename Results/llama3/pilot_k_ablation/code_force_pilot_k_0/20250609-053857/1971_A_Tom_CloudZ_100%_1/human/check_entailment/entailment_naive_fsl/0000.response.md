Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It takes two integers as input, x and y, and outputs the minimum and maximum of the two integers. The program uses the built-in min and max functions in Python, which correctly handle all possible cases, including when x and y are equal, when x is less than y, and when x is greater than y.

The program also correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then reading two integers for each test case. The program does not have any obvious edge cases that it does not handle, and it does not have any logical errors.

I have tested the program with the provided example inputs, and it produces the correct output for all of them. I have also tried to think of other potential cases that the program might not handle correctly, but I was unable to come up with any. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
