Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to read a number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads two integers and prints the minimum and maximum of these two integers.

The program defines a function `func()` that reads an integer `t` from the standard input, which represents the number of test cases. It then enters a loop that runs `t` times. In each iteration of the loop, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b` using the `map()` function and prints the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b` using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads the number of test cases, reads the specified number of test cases (each consisting of two integers), and prints the minimum and maximum of each pair of integers.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct in its implementation and functionality.

Correctness: **True**
