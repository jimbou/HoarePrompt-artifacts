Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where it needs to read an integer t, followed by t lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers x and y. It then prints t lines, each containing the smaller and larger of the two input integers x and y, in that order.

The program uses a for loop to iterate t times, and in each iteration, it reads two integers a and b using the map function. It then prints the minimum and maximum of a and b using the built-in min and max functions.

The program correctly implements the required logic and does not have any syntax errors or logical flaws. It reads the input as specified, processes it correctly, and produces the desired output.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
