Reasoning:

1. The problem requires reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case.
2. In each test case, two integers `x` and `y` are read, and the minimum and maximum values are printed.
3. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
4. Inside the loop, it reads two integers `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`, which correctly splits the input line into two integers.
5. The program then prints the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively.
6. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws that would prevent it from producing the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
