Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the integer value from the first input in stdin, which is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The remaining inputs in stdin are still present, consisting of t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y, where x and y are between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
