Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input string is "ab", the program will output "Yes" and "ab", but it should output "No" because there is no rearrangement of "ab" that is not equal to "ab".

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the first character is repeated throughout the string, but it does not check if there are any other repeated characters. It also does not check if the string can be rearranged to form a different string.

To fix this, the program should check if the string has any repeated characters, and if it does, it should try to rearrange the string to form a different string. If it cannot find a rearrangement, it should output "No".
