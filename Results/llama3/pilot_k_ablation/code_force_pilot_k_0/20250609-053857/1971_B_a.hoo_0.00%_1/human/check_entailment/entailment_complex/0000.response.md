Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from standard input and stores it in the variable `cnt_test_cases`.
2. The program then iterates over each test case, reading a string `s` from standard input and storing it in the variable `string`.
3. The program checks if the length of the string is 1, in which case it prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
4. The program then checks if all characters in the string are the same by comparing the first character `m` with each character in the string. If all characters are the same, it prints "No" because it's impossible to rearrange the string to form a different string.
5. If the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, the program prints "Yes" and then prints the sorted string using the `sorted` function and the `join` method. This is a valid rearrangement of the original string that is not equal to the original string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* Strings of length 1: prints "No"
* Strings with all characters the same: prints "No"
* Strings with more than one character and not all characters the same: prints "Yes" followed by the sorted string

The program does not modify the input count of test cases, and the output is consistent with the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
