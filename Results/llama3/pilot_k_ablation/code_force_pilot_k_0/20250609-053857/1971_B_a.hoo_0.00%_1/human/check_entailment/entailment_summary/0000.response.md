Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the edge cases where the input string has only one character or all characters are the same, in which case it prints 'No'. For all other cases, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted string, which is a valid rearrangement of the original string that is not equal to the original string.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required behavior. The use of the `sorted` function to rearrange the characters in the string is a clever and efficient way to generate a new string that is not equal to the original string.

Correctness: **True**
