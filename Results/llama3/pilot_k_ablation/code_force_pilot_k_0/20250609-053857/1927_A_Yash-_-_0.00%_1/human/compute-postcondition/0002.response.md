Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of a strip) and a string of characters 'W' or 'B' (the strip). It then calculates and prints the length of the longest contiguous substring of 'B's in each input string. If no 'B's are found in a string, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and does not modify the input strings or the integer `n`.**
