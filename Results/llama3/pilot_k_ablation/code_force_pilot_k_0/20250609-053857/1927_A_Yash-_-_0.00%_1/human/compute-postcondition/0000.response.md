Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a string of characters 'W' or 'B' (the strip) of the same length as the integer `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a positive integer, which is the length of the strip. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each containing one input: a string of characters 'W' or 'B' (the strip) of the same length as the integer `n`. The code has consumed the first input of each test case, which was the length of the strip, and assigned it to the variable `n`. The remaining input, the string of characters 'W' or 'B', is still in the stdin, waiting to be processed.
