Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all cells to become white. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (the length of a strip) and a string of characters 'W' or 'B' (the strip).

The program correctly calculates the length of the longest contiguous substring of 'B's in each input string by finding the start and end indices of the first and last 'B's in the string. If no 'B's are found in a string, it correctly prints 0.

The program processes all test cases and does not modify the input strings or the integer `n`. The output of the program matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct and solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
