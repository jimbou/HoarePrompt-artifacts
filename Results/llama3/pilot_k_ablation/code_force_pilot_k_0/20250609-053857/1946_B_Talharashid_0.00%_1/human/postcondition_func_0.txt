This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a result for each test case by iterating through the integers, maintaining a running sum (c) and a maximum value (maxi). If an integer is negative and its absolute value exceeds the current running sum, the function updates maxi and resets the running sum. Finally, the function prints the result of the calculation (2^k * maxi - maxi + sum of all integers) modulo 1000000007 for each test case.
