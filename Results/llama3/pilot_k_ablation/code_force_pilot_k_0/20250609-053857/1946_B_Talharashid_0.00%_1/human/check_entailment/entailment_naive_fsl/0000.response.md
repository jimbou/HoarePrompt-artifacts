Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is:

5 1
4 -2 8 -12 9

The program outputs 17, but the correct output should be 896. The program is not correctly implementing the logic to find the maximum possible sum of the array after k operations.

The program is trying to find the maximum sum of the array by finding the maximum sum of a subarray and then multiplying it by 2^k. However, this approach is not correct because it does not consider all possible subarrays and their sums.

A correct approach would be to find the maximum sum of all possible subarrays and then multiply it by 2^k. This can be done by using a dynamic programming approach to find the maximum sum of all possible subarrays.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
