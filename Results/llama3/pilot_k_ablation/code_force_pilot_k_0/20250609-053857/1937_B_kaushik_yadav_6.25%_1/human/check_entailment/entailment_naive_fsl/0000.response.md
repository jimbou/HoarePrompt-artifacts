Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not a simple concatenation of the first row and the second row. For example, when the input is:

3
2
01
10

The program will output "010" as the lexicographically smallest string, but the correct output should be "001". The program also incorrectly counts the number of paths that yield this string.

The issue is that the program only checks if the current character in the first row is greater than the next character in the second row, and if so, it switches to the second row. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee the lexicographically smallest string. A correct solution would need to consider all possible paths and compare them to find the lexicographically smallest one.
