This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length. It then processes each test case by concatenating the binary strings in a specific order, based on certain conditions, and prints the resulting binary string. Additionally, it counts the maximum number of consecutive '1's in the first binary string that are followed by '0's in the second binary string and prints this count. The function repeats this process for all test cases and outputs the results in a specific format.
