The `print(*sorted(st, reverse=True))` statement will print the elements of the set `st` in descending order.

Since `st` is a set containing `n` unique integers between 2 and 10^9 + 3 * 10^5 inclusive, the printed output will be a list of these unique integers in descending order.

The `*` operator in the `print` statement is used to unpack the sorted list of integers into separate arguments to the `print` function, so the output will be a space-separated list of integers.

Output: **a list of n unique integers between 2 and 10^9 + 3 * 10^5 inclusive, in descending order, separated by spaces**
