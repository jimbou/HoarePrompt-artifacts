Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, st is an empty set**

The code reads an integer n from the input, which represents the number of elements in the list arr. The value of n is between 1 and 3 * 10^5 inclusive. The code then reads n space-separated integers from the input and stores them in the list arr. The elements of arr are integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The set st is initialized as an empty set. Since the code only reads one test case, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
