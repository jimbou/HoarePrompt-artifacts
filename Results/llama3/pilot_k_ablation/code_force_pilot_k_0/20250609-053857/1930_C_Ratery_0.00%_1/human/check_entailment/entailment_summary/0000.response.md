Reasoning: 
The program is correct because it accurately implements the described problem. It reads the input, transforms the integers by adding their 1-based index, stores the results in a set to ensure uniqueness, and prints the transformed integers in descending order. This matches the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
