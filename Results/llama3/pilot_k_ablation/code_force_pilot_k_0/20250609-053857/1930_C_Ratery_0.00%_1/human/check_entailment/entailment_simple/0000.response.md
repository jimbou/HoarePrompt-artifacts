Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
3. It creates an empty set `st` to store unique elements.
4. It iterates over the array `arr` and adds each element `arr[i]` plus its index `i` plus 1 to the set `st`. This is equivalent to the operation described in the problem statement, where `a_i + i` is inserted into the set `S`.
5. After iterating over the entire array, the set `st` contains the unique elements that would be in the set `S` after `n` operations.
6. The program then sorts the set `st` in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.
7. Finally, it prints the sorted list of unique elements, which represents the lexicographically largest `b` that can be constructed.

The program correctly implements the problem statement and produces the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
