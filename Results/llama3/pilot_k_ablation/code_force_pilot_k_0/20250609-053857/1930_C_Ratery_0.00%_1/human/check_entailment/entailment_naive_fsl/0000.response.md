Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The program uses a set to store unique elements, which is correct because the problem states that the set S is not a multiset and can only contain unique elements. The program also correctly calculates the elements to be inserted into the set by adding the index i to the corresponding element in the array.

The program then sorts the set in decreasing order and prints the elements, which is correct because the problem asks for the lexicographically largest b that Stack can make.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program handles all edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or contains duplicate elements. The program also correctly handles the case when the input array contains large numbers, as the problem states that the elements of the array can be up to 10^9.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
