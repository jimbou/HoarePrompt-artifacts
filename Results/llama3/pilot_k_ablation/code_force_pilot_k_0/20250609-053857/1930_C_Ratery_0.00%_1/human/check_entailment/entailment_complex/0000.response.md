Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.

2. The program correctly implements the three-step operation: It adds the 1-based index `i` to each element `a_i` and stores the result in a set `st`. This ensures that each element in `st` is unique, as required by the problem.

3. The program correctly constructs the new array `b`: It sorts the elements in `st` in descending order and prints them. This is the lexicographically largest `b` that can be constructed from the input array `a`.

4. The program handles the constraints correctly: The input array `a` can have up to `3 * 10^5` elements, and each element can be up to `10^9`. The program can handle these large inputs correctly.

5. The program's output format is correct: It prints the elements of `b` separated by spaces, as required by the problem.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
