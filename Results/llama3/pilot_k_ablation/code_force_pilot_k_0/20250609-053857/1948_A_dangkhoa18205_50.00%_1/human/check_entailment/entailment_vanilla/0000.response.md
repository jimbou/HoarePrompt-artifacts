Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes an integer n as input and checks if n is less than or equal to 1. If true, it prints 'NO' because there cannot be a string with exactly n special characters. If n is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string by iterating over the uppercase Latin letters. It adds two consecutive occurrences of the same letter to the string if n is greater than or equal to 2, and a single occurrence of the letter if n is 1. This process continues until n becomes 0.

func_2 takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases. It calls func_1 for each test case.

The program correctly handles the problem constraints and requirements. It checks for the base case where n is less than or equal to 1 and prints 'NO' accordingly. For n greater than 1, it constructs a string with exactly n special characters by adding consecutive occurrences of the same letter.

However, there is a logical error in the program. In the while loop of func_1, when n is 1, the program adds a single occurrence of the letter to the string and decrements n by 1. But this will result in a string with n+1 special characters, not n. For example, if n is 3, the program will output "AABB" which has 4 special characters, not 3.

Correctness: **False**
