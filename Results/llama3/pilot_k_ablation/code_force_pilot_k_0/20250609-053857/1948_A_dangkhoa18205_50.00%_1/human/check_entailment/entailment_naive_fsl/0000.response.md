Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to build a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program uses a while loop to add characters to the result string, ensuring that each character is repeated at least twice to create special characters. The loop continues until n special characters have been added.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If n is 1, the program prints "NO" because it is not possible to create a string with exactly 1 special character.
* If n is greater than 1, the program prints "YES" and creates a string with exactly n special characters.
* The program uses the modulo operator to cycle through the uppercase Latin letters, ensuring that the string does not exceed a length of 200 characters.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
