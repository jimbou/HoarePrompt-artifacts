Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 reads a positive integer n from standard input and checks if it is greater than 1. If true, it prints 'YES' and generates a string of repeated letters from 'A' to 'Z' based on the input integer. The generated string has exactly n special characters. If n is less than or equal to 1, it prints 'NO'.

func_2 reads an integer t from standard input and executes func_1 t times.

The program meets the problem description because:

* func_1 correctly generates a string with exactly n special characters when n is greater than 1.
* func_1 correctly prints 'NO' when n is less than or equal to 1.
* func_2 correctly executes func_1 t times, allowing the program to handle multiple test cases.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
