Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 reads a positive integer from standard input, checks if it is greater than 1, and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise prints 'NO'. If 'YES' is printed, it generates a string of repeated letters from 'A' to 'Z' based on the input integer and prints the resulting string.

func_2 reads an integer t from standard input, executes func_1() t times, and leaves standard input empty.

The program meets the problem description because func_1 correctly generates a string with the required number of special characters, and func_2 executes func_1 the correct number of times based on the input.

Correctness: **True**
