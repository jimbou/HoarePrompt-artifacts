This function reads a positive integer from standard input, checks if it is greater than 1, and prints 'YES' if true, otherwise prints 'NO'. If 'YES' is printed, it generates a string of repeated letters from 'A' to 'Z' based on the input integer and prints the resulting string. The function consumes the input from standard input and leaves it empty.
