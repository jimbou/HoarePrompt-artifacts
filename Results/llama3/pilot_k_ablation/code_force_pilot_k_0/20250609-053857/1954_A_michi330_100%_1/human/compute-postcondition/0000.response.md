The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t lines, each containing three integers n, m and k.**
