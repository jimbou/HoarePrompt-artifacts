Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks if the number of parts is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint, or if the number of parts minus the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color (due to the pigeonhole principle) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint. If either of these conditions is true, it means Bob can make all parts have the same color, and the program prints "NO". Otherwise, it prints "YES".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `n` is 1, `m` is 1, or `k` is 0. The use of `math.ceil` ensures that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of parts that must be painted with the same color.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
