Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k` checks if Bob can repaint at most k parts to make all parts have the same color. If this condition is true, it means Bob can make all parts have the same color, so the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n = 1, m = 1, or k = 1. The use of `math.ceil(n / m)` is also correct, as it ensures that the division result is rounded up to the nearest integer, which is necessary to account for the case where n is not exactly divisible by m.

Overall, the program is well-structured, easy to understand, and correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
