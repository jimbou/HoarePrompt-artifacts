This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k. It then determines whether a certain condition is met (n > k and n - math.ceil(n / m) > k) and prints 'YES' if the condition is true, and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, one per line, until all input has been read.
