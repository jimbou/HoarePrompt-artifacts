Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as two numbers in the array that satisfy certain modular arithmetic conditions based on the given integers x and y.

The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of modular values (mod_x, mod_y) for each number in the array. It then iterates through the array, calculates the required modular values for each number, and checks if the required pair is already present in the dictionary. If it is, it increments the beautiful_count by the frequency of the required pair.

The program correctly handles the case where x or y is 1, as the required modular value for x or y would be 0, and the frequency of (0, mod_y) or (mod_x, 0) would be correctly incremented.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate numbers, as the frequency of each pair of modular values is correctly incremented.

The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs in the corresponding test case.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
