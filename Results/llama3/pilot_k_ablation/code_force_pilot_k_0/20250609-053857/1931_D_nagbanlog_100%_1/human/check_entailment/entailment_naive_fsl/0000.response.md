Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. It uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of modulo values for x and y. For each number in the array, it calculates the required modulo values to form a beautiful pair and checks if such a pair exists in the dictionary. If it does, it increments the beautiful count. The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where x or y is 1, and the case where the array contains duplicate numbers.

The program also correctly handles the case where the required modulo values are the same as the current modulo values, which would result in a pair with the same index. This is because the problem statement specifies that the pair of indices (i, j) must satisfy 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, which means that i and j cannot be the same.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
