Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of three elements: the first element is a positive integer `n`, the second and third elements are positive integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, x, y = case['params']
    a = case['array']
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    beautiful_count = 0
    for num in a:
        mod_x = num % x
        mod_y = num % y
        required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
        required_mod_y = mod_y
        if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
            beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
        freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
    results.append(beautiful_count)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
