Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of test cases, each test case is a list of three elements: the first element is a positive integer `n`, the second and third elements are positive integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` positive integers, `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The variable `results` is newly introduced and is assigned an empty list.
