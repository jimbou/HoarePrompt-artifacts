Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of beautiful pairs in the corresponding test case. The list has the same length as the number of test cases in the `test_cases` list. Each integer in the list is calculated based on the corresponding test case, which includes a positive integer `n`, two positive integers `x` and `y`, and a list of `n` positive integers.**
