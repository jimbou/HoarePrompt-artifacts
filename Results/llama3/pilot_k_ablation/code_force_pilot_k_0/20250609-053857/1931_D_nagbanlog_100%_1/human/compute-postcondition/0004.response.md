Functionality: **This function calculates the count of beautiful pairs in each test case and returns a list of these counts. A beautiful pair is defined as two numbers in the array that satisfy certain modular arithmetic conditions based on the given integers x and y. The function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case includes a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of n positive integers. It processes each test case, calculates the count of beautiful pairs, and returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.**
