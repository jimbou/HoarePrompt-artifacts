The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input from stdin to the variable `t`. Since the first input is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` will be assigned a value within this range.

The remaining input in stdin will be `t` lines, each containing a single integer `n` between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer `n` between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).**
