Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent integer (n) represents the number of lines to be printed in a specific pattern. For each test case, the function prints a fixed pattern of lines, starting with '1 1' and '1 2', followed by either '2 3' if n is 3, or '2 4' and then n-3 lines of the form 'j j' if n is 4 or more. The function generates a total of 2t + 2 lines of output, where t is the number of test cases.**
