Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list. Then, it iterates through the `cntl` list to find the smallest index `j` such that the count of `j` is less than 2. If no such index is found, it outputs 0.

The program correctly handles the case where the count of 0 is 0, in which case the output is 0. It also correctly handles the case where the count of 0 is greater than 0, in which case it outputs the smallest index `j` such that the count of `j` is less than 2.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score of the game. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
