Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves an array `a` of size `n`, where Alice and Bob take turns picking elements from the array, with Alice appending her chosen elements to a new array `c` and Bob deleting his chosen elements from `a`. The game ends when `a` is empty, and the score is defined as the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

The program uses a frequency count array `cntl` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in `a`. It then iterates through `cntl` to determine the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `cntl[0]` is 0, it means that 0 is not present in `a`, so the MEX of `c` will be 0. In this case, the program prints 0.

2. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, it means that 0 is present in `a`. The program then sets `c` to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. This is because Alice can choose at most two 0s to maximize the MEX of `c`.

3. The program then iterates through `cntl` starting from index 1. If it finds an index `j` where `cntl[j]` is less than 2, it means that `j` is not present in `a` or is present only once.

4. If `cntl[j]` is 0, it means that `j` is not present in `a`, so the MEX of `c` will be `j`. In this case, the program prints `j`.

5. If `cntl[j]` is 1, it means that `j` is present only once in `a`. The program then decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it means that Alice has chosen two 0s and Bob has chosen one `j`, so the MEX of `c` will be `j`. In this case, the program prints `j`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the optimal score for the game.

Correctness: **True**
