Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally. It first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `a` using the `cntl` list. Then, it checks if the number 0 is present in the array. If not, it prints 0 as the final score. If 0 is present, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0s. It then iterates over the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the count of each number is less than 2. If the count is 0, it prints the current number as the final score and breaks the loop. If the count is 1, it decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it prints the current number as the final score and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the array `a` contains only one element or where the number 0 is not present in the array. It also correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally, as described in the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the final answer is Correctness: **True**.
