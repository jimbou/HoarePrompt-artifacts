Output State: `loop_counter` is 100, `answers` is unchanged.

The loop will execute 99 times, and after each iteration, `loop_counter` will be incremented by 1. Since the loop condition is `loop_counter != 100`, the loop will terminate when `loop_counter` reaches 100. The value of `answers` remains unchanged because the `if` conditions inside the loop are not met, and no elements are appended to the `answers` list.
