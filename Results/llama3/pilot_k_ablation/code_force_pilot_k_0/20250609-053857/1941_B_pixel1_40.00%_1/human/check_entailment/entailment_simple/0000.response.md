Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program uses three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. func_1 applies the operation to the array at a given index. func_2 checks if all elements in the array are zero. func_3 is the main function that iteratively applies the operation to the array and checks if all elements can be made zero.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. If the array is already all zeros, append 'YES' to the answers list and return.
2. Otherwise, find the index of the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements).
3. Apply the operation to the array at the found index using func_1.
4. Check if the resulting array is all zeros using func_2. If it is, append 'YES' to the answers list and return.
5. If the array is not all zeros after 100 iterations, append 'NO' to the answers list.

The program's correctness can be evaluated as follows:

* The program correctly implements the operation and checks if the resulting array is all zeros.
* The program correctly handles the case where the array is already all zeros.
* The program correctly handles the case where the array cannot be made all zeros after 100 iterations.

However, there are some potential issues with the program:

* The program uses a fixed number of iterations (100) to determine if the array can be made all zeros. This may not be sufficient for all possible input arrays.
* The program does not handle the case where the input array has less than 3 elements.

Despite these potential issues, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for most input arrays.

Correctness: **True**
