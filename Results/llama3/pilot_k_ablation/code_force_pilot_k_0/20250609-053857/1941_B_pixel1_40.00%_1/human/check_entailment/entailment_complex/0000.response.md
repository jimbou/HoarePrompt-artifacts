Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given array of integers can be transformed into a state where all elements are zero by repeatedly applying a specific operation.

Function 1 (`func_1`) correctly implements the operation described in the problem, decrementing the values of three consecutive elements in the array by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

Function 2 (`func_2`) correctly checks if all elements in the input array are equal to 0. If any element is not 0, it immediately returns False. If all elements are 0, it returns True.

Function 3 (`func_3`) is the main function that determines whether the input array can be transformed into a state where all elements are zero. It first checks if the input array is already in the desired state using `func_2`. If it is, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns. If not, it enters a loop that applies the operation implemented in `func_1` to the array, repeatedly checking if the transformed array meets the condition using `func_2`. If the condition is met within 100 iterations, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns. If the loop completes without meeting the condition, it appends 'NO' to the answers list.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and should produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
