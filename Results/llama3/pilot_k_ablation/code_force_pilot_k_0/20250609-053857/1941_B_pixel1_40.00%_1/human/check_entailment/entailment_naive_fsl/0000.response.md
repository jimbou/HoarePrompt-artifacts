Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example where the program fails is when the input array is [1, 2, 7, 2]. The program will output 'NO', but it is actually possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it uses a greedy approach, always choosing the index with the highest number to apply the operation. However, this approach does not always lead to the optimal solution. In the case of the input array [1, 2, 7, 2], the program will apply the operation at index 2, resulting in the array [1, 0, 5, 2]. From this point, it is not possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations, so the program outputs 'NO'. However, if the operation is applied at index 3 instead, the array becomes [1, 2, 5, 0], and it is possible to make all elements of the array zero by applying the operation at index 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not always find the optimal solution, and it may output 'NO' even when it is possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.
