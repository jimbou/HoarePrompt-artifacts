Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves subtracting 1 from the elements at indices i-1 and i+1, and subtracting 2 from the element at index i.

The program consists of three functions:

1. `func_1(array, index)`: This function applies the operation to the array at the specified index.

2. `func_2(arrayForSuccess)`: This function checks if all elements in the array are zero.

3. `func_3(inputarray)`: This function is the main function that attempts to make all elements of the array zero. It first checks if the array is already all zeros using `func_2`. If not, it enters a loop where it finds the index of the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements), applies the operation at that index using `func_1`, and checks again if the array is all zeros using `func_2`. If the array is all zeros, it appends 'YES' to the `answers` list. If the loop counter reaches 100 without the array becoming all zeros, it appends 'NO' to the `answers` list.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

- The loop counter in `func_3` is set to 100, which means the function will stop trying to make the array all zeros after 100 iterations, even if it's possible to do so in more iterations. This could lead to incorrect results for arrays that require more than 100 operations to become all zeros.

- The function does not handle the case where the input array has less than 3 elements. According to the problem description, the array should have at least 3 elements.

- The function does not handle the case where the input array contains negative numbers. According to the problem description, the array elements should be non-negative.

- The function does not handle the case where the input array is not a list of integers. According to the problem description, the array elements should be integers.

- The function uses a list called `answers` to store the results, but this list is not defined anywhere in the code.

- The function does not check if the input array is valid according to the problem description.

- The function does not check if the operation can be applied to the array without resulting in negative numbers.

- The function does not check if the array can be made all zeros using the operation.

- The function does not provide any feedback or error messages when the input array is invalid or when the operation cannot be applied.

- The function does not provide any feedback or error messages when the array cannot be made all zeros using the operation.

Correctness: **False**
