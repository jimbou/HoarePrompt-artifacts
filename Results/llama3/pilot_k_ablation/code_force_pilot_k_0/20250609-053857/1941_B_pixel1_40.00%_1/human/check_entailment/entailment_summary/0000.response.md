Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decrementing three consecutive elements in the array by 1, 2, and 1 respectively.

The program consists of three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` implements the operation, `func_2` checks if all elements in the array are equal to zero, and `func_3` determines whether the array can be transformed into a state where all elements are zero by repeatedly applying the operation.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the array, and calls `func_3` to determine whether the array can be transformed into a state where all elements are zero. If `func_3` returns 'YES', it means the array can be transformed, and if it returns 'NO', it means the array cannot be transformed.

The key to the program's correctness lies in the implementation of `func_3`. It uses a while loop to repeatedly apply the operation to the array, and after each application, it checks if the array has been transformed into a state where all elements are zero using `func_2`. If the array has been transformed, it appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns. If the loop counter reaches 100 without transforming the array, it appends 'NO' to the answers list.

However, there is a flaw in the implementation of `func_3`. The loop counter is set to 100, which means the program will only attempt to transform the array up to 100 times. If the array requires more than 100 transformations to reach a state where all elements are zero, the program will incorrectly append 'NO' to the answers list.

Therefore, the program is not entirely correct. It may produce incorrect results for arrays that require more than 100 transformations to reach a state where all elements are zero.

Correctness: **False**
