Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `max_val` is `n`, `i` is 0, `m` is 0, `p` is 0, stdin is empty, and the function `func_2` has been called with the argument `-1`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, `p`, and stdin remain unchanged. The only change is that the function `func_2` has been called with the argument `-1`, but since the code snippet does not provide the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact effect of this function call on the program state.
