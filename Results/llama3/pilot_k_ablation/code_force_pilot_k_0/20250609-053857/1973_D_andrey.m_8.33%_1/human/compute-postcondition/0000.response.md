Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, where 1 <= t <= 10^3, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the positive integer input from stdin, which is within the range of 1 to 10^3. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed by the `input()` function.
