Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value `m`. It starts by finding the maximum value `max_val` that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays. Then, it iterates over possible values of `m` from `n // k` down to `1`, where `n` is the length of the array. For each `m`, it checks if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays such that the product of the length and maximum of each subarray is equal to `m`. If it finds such an `m`, it calls `func_2` to print the answer and returns.

The program also handles the case where no such `m` exists by calling `func_2` with an argument of `-1`.

The program uses `func_1` to make queries to the hidden array and `func_2` to print the answer. The `func_4` function reads the number of test cases and calls `func_3` for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to find the largest value `m` that satisfies the conditions of the problem.

Correctness: **True**
