Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The program first counts the occurrences of each number in the array using a dictionary. Then it iterates over the numbers from 0 to n-1. If a number is not present in the array, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If a number appears only once in the array and it's the first time it encounters such a number, it sets the answer to the next number and continues the loop. If a number appears only once in the array and it's not the first time it encounters such a number, it sets the answer to the current number and breaks the loop.

This strategy is correct because Alice's goal is to maximize the score, which means she wants to include as many numbers as possible in her array. If a number is not present in the array, it's the smallest possible score. If a number appears only once in the array, Alice can include it in her array and Bob can't remove it, so the score will be the next number. If a number appears only once in the array and it's not the first time it encounters such a number, Alice can't include it in her array because Bob will remove it, so the score will be the current number.

Correctness: **True**
