Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the smallest positive integer that is either not present in the list or appears only once, which is the MEX of the array c. The program uses a dictionary to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates over the range of possible numbers to find the smallest one that meets the condition.

The program handles the case where a number appears only once by setting a flag `once` to True when it encounters the first number with a count of 1. If it encounters another number with a count of 1, it breaks the loop and returns the current number as the answer.

The program also handles the case where a number is not present in the array by checking if the count of the current number is 0. If it is, it sets the answer to the current number and breaks the loop.

The program prints the answer for each test case, and it processes all test cases and empties the standard input.

Correctness: **True**
