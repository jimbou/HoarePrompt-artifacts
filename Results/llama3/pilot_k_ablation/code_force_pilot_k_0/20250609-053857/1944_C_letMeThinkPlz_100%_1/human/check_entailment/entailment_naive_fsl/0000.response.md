Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the game's final score if both players play optimally. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n to find the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array or occurs only once.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If a number occurs zero times, it is the MEX.
* If a number occurs only once and it is the first such number, the MEX is the next number.
* If a number occurs only once and it is not the first such number, the MEX is the current number.
* If all numbers occur more than once, the MEX is the next number after the largest number in the array.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the array contains only one element, or when the array contains all numbers from 0 to n.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
