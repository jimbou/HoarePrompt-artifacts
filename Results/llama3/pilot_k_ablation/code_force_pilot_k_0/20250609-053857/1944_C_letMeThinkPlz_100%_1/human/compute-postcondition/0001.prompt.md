Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a list of integers (0 <= integer < 2 * 10^5). The sum of the lengths of the lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
            ans = i
            break
    print(ans)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
