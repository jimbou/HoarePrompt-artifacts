The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each with two inputs: an integer and a list of integers. The first input of the first test case is an integer (1 <= integer <= 2 * 10^4), which is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains one input: a list of integers (0 <= integer < 2 * 10^5). The sum of the lengths of the lists over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.**
