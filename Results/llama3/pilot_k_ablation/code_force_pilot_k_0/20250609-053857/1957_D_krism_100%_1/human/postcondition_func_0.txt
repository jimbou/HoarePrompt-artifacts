This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a positive integer n and a list of n positive integers. It calculates the total number of pairs of elements in the prefix XOR array that have the same bit set or not set at the same position, and prints this count for each test case. The function does not modify the input values or standard input.
