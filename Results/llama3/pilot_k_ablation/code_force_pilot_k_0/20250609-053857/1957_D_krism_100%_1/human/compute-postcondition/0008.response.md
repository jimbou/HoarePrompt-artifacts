Output State: **`ans` is 0, prefix remains unchanged, n remains unchanged, arr remains unchanged, stdin remains unchanged, pre is a list of 32 lists where each sublist contains two elements, the first element of each sublist is 1 and the second element is 0, suf is a list of 32 lists where each sublist contains two elements, the first element of each sublist is the number of times the corresponding bit is set in the prefix array from index n to 1, and the second element is the number of times the corresponding bit is not set in the prefix array from index n to 1.**
