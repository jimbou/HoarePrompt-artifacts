Output State: **n is a positive integer, arr is a list of positive integers, prefix is a list containing a single element 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the first input to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, it becomes the length of the list. The second line assigns a list of integers from the second input to `arr`. Since the list contains positive integers, `arr` becomes a list of positive integers. The third line assigns a list containing a single element 0 to `prefix`. Since `prefix` is a list, it becomes a list containing a single element 0. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and after executing the code, one test case is removed from stdin.
