Based on the precondition, the variable `ans` is the total number of pairs of elements in the prefix array from index 1 to n that have the same bit set or not set at the same position.

The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the total number of pairs of elements in the prefix array from index 1 to n that have the same bit set or not set at the same position.

Since the exact value of `ans` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the total number of pairs of elements in the prefix array from index 1 to n that have the same bit set or not set at the same position.

Output: **The total number of pairs of elements in the prefix array from index 1 to n that have the same bit set or not set at the same position**
