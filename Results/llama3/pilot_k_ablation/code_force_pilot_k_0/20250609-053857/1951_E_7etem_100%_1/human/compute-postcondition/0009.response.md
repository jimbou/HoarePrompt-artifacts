Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is odd, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True, `a` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. The string `ch` is still a string of lowercase Latin characters with an odd length, and `b` is still an integer equal to half the length of `ch`. Additionally, the condition `func_1(ch[:b])` returns True remains valid.
