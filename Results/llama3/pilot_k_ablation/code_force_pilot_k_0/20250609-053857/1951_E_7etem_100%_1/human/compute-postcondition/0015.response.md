Functionality: **The function determines the value to return based on the length of the input string 'ch' and the result of applying function 'func_1' to the first half of 'ch'. If 'ch' has an even length, it returns 3 if 'func_1' is true for the first half, and 4 otherwise. If 'ch' has an odd length, it returns 1 if 'func_1' is true for the first half, and 2 otherwise.**
