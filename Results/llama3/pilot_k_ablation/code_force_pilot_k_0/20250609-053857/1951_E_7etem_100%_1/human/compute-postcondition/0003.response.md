Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, the current value of `ch` from index 0 to `b` satisfies the condition `func_1(ch[:b])`, `a` is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The string `ch` still consists of lowercase Latin characters and has an even length. The integer `b` remains equal to half the length of `ch`. The substring of `ch` from index 0 to `b` still satisfies the condition `func_1(ch[:b])`. Additionally, a new variable `a` has been introduced and assigned the value 3.
