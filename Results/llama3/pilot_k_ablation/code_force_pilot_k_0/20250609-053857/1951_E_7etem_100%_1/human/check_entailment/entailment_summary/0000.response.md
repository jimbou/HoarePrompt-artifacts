Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to check if a string is a palindrome and determine the partitioning strategy, respectively.

The main program iterates over multiple test cases, each containing a string `s`. It first checks if `s` is a palindrome using `func_1`. If `s` is not a palindrome, it proceeds to partition `s` into substrings using `func_2`. The partitioning strategy depends on the length of `s` and the result of applying `func_1` to the first half of `s`.

The program then checks if the partitioned substrings are not palindromes using `func_1`. If all substrings are not palindromes, it prints "YES" followed by the number of substrings and the substrings themselves. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Based on the execution summaries of `func_1` and `func_2`, it appears that the program correctly implements the problem description. `func_1` correctly checks if a string is a palindrome, and `func_2` correctly determines the partitioning strategy based on the length of the input string and the result of applying `func_1` to the first half of the string.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
