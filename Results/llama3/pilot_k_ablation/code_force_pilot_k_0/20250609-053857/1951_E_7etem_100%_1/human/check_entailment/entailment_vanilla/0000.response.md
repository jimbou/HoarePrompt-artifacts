Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings that are not palindromes. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string is a palindrome by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

`func_2` takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome using `func_1`. If the string is a palindrome, it returns a value based on the length of the string and whether it is even or odd. If the string is not a palindrome, it returns a different value.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string is a single character. In this case, `func_1` will return `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome, but the program should return "NO" because a single character cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

2. The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string consists of the same character repeated multiple times. In this case, `func_2` will return a value based on the length of the string, but the program should return "NO" because such a string cannot be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings.

3. The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string is already a non-palindrome. In this case, `func_2` will return a value based on the length of the string, but the program should return "YES" and print the original string as the partition.

4. The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. In this case, `func_2` will return a value based on the length of the string, but the program should return "YES" and print the partitioned substrings.

In summary, the program does not correctly solve the problem and has several logical errors.

Correctness: **False**
