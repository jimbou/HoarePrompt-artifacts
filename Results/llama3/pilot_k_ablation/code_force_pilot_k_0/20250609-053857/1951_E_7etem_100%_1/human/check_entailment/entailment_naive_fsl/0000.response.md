Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to partition the string into some substrings, such that each substring is not a palindrome. However, the program does not provide a solution for this problem. It only defines two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which seem to be related to checking if a string is a palindrome, but they do not provide a way to partition the string into non-palindromic substrings.

For example, if the input string is "abccba", the program does not provide a way to partition it into non-palindromic substrings, such as "ab" and "ccb" and "a". Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Note that the program does not even attempt to solve the problem, it only defines some functions that are not used to solve the problem.
