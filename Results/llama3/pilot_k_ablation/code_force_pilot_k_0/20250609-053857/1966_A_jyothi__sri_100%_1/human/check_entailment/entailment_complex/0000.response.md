Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The issue lies in the logic of the program. The program checks if the count of any number in the hashmap is greater than or equal to k, and if so, it sets the answer to k-1. However, this is not correct.

The correct approach is to calculate the minimum number of cards that can be left in the hand after any number of operations. This can be done by counting the number of cards that can be exchanged for k-1 cards, and then adding the remaining cards that cannot be exchanged.

The program should calculate the count of each number in the hashmap, and then for each count, it should calculate the number of times it can be exchanged for k-1 cards. The remaining count should be added to the answer.

Here is the correct code:

```python
t = int(input())
while t > 0:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    
    arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    hashmap = {}
    
    ans = 0
    
    for i in arrC:
        if i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[i] = 1
    
    for key in hashmap:
        ans += hashmap[key] % k
        if hashmap[key] // k > 0:
            ans += (hashmap[key] // k) * (k - 1)
    
    print(ans)
    
    t -= 1
```

Correctness: **False**
