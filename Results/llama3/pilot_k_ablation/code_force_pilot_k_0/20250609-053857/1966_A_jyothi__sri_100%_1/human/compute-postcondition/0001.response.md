Output State: **t is 0, and the standard output contains t lines, each with an integer value.**

The output state is the result of executing the given Python loop for all test cases provided in the standard input. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive). In each iteration, it reads two lines from the standard input: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n`.

The loop creates a hashmap to store the frequency of each integer in the array `arrC`. It then iterates through the array, updating the hashmap and checking if the frequency of any integer reaches `k`. If it does, the answer `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Finally, the loop prints the answer `ans` and decrements `t` by 1.

After all iterations, the output state is that `t` is 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The standard output contains `t` lines, each with an integer value representing the answer for the corresponding test case. The state of other variables in the precondition, such as `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `hashmap`, is not affected by the loop head and body and remains unchanged.
