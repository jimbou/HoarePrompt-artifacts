The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. 

In the initial state, the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` test cases. 

So, after executing the code, the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), and the standard input will contain `t` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 2 <= `k` <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n` (1 <= `c_i` <= 100).**
