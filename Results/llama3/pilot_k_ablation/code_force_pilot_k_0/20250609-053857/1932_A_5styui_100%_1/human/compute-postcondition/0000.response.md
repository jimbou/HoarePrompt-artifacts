The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases, `a` becomes the value of t. The second line initializes `s` to 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains t test cases, each consisting of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters**
