Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters (representing coins) in each string, ignoring any '*' characters (representing thorns) and their adjacent characters. The function prints the count of coins for each test case and resets the count for the next test case.**
