Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. It considers two scenarios: buying all yogurts at the regular price (s1) and buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price (s2). The program then prints the minimum of these two scenarios.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If n is even, the program buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, which is the optimal solution.
* If n is odd, the program buys n-1 yogurts in pairs at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price, which is the optimal solution.
* If the promotion price is higher than the regular price, the program buys all yogurts at the regular price, which is the optimal solution.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when n is 1, in which case it buys the single yogurt at the regular price.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".
