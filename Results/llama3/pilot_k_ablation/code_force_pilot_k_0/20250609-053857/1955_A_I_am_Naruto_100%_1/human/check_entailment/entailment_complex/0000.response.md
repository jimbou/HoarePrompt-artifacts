Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum of two calculated values for each case.

The program calculates two possible costs for buying n yogurts:

1.  `s1 = n * a`: This represents the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price of a burles each.
2.  `s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a`: This represents the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price of b burles for two yogurts. The expression `n // 2` calculates the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, and `n % 2` calculates the remaining yogurt that needs to be bought at the regular price.

The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated costs using the `min(s1, s2)` function.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program correctly calculates and displays the minimum cost for each test case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
