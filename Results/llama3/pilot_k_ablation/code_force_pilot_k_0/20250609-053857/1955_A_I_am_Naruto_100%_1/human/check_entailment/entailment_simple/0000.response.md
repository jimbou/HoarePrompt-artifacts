Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes the number of test cases t as input, followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b.

The program calculates two possible costs for buying n yogurts:

- s1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a).
- s2: The cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion price (b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a). This calculation takes into account the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (n // 2) and the remaining yogurt(s) that need to be bought at the regular price (n % 2 * a).

The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated costs (min(s1, s2)) for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts based on the given problem description. It handles all possible cases, including when n is even or odd, and when the promotion price is more or less advantageous than the regular price.

Correctness: **True**
