Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, given the price of one yogurt (a) and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b).

2. The program defines a function `func()` that iterates over the number of test cases (t) specified in the input.

3. For each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price of one yogurt (a), and the price of two yogurts on promotion (b) from the input.

4. It calculates two possible costs:
   - `s1`: the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a).
   - `s2`: the cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion, which is the cost of buying n//2 pairs of yogurts at the promotion price (b * (n // 2)) plus the cost of buying the remaining yogurt (if any) at the regular price (n % 2 * a).

5. It prints the minimum cost between `s1` and `s2` for each test case.

6. The program correctly handles the cases where n is even or odd, and it correctly calculates the minimum cost in both scenarios.

7. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
