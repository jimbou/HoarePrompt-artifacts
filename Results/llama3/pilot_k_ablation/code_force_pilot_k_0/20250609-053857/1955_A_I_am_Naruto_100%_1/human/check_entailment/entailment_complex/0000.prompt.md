Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The price of one yogurt at the "Vosmiorochka" store is a burles, but there is
a promotion where you can buy two yogurts for b burles.

Maxim needs to buy exactly n yogurts. When buying two yogurts, he can choose
to buy them at the regular price or at the promotion price.

What is the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le {10}^{4} ) — the
number of test cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and
b (1 \le n \le 100 , 1 \le a, b \le 30 ) — the number of yogurts Maxim wants
to buy, the price for one yogurt, and the price for two yogurts on promotion.

Output

For each test case, print in a separate line the minimum cost of buying n
yogurts at "Vosmiorochka".

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 5 9
    
    3 5 9
    
    3 5 11
    
    4 5 11

Output

    9
    14
    15
    20
    
Note

In the third test case of the example, it is more advantageous to buy three
yogurts for 15 burles than two for 11 and one for 5 .

In the fourth test case of the example, you need to buy four yogurts, each for
5 burles.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 lines, where t is a positive integer. The first line contains one integer t. Each of the remaining t lines contains three positive integers n, a, and b, where n is less than or equal to 100, and a and b are less than or equal to 30.
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        s1 = n * a
        
        s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
        
        print(min(s1, s2))
        
    #State: The output state will contain t lines, each containing the minimum of two calculated values, s1 and s2, for each of the t test cases. The values of s1 and s2 are calculated based on the input values of n, a, and b for each test case.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the minimum of two calculated values for each case. It takes no arguments and returns no values, instead, it outputs the results directly to the console. The function's purpose is to calculate and display the minimum cost for each test case based on the provided input values.

# Your response:
Reasoning:
