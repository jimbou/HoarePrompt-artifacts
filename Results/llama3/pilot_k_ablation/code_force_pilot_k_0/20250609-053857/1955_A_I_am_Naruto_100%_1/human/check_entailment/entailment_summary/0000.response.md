Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum cost for Maxim to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for a lower price.

The program calculates two possible costs for each test case:

- s1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a).
- s2: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion (b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a). This calculation takes into account the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price (n // 2), and the remaining yogurt(s) that need to be bought at the regular price (n % 2 * a).

The program then prints the minimum of these two calculated costs (min(s1, s2)).

Based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost for each test case. It handles the promotion correctly and calculates the minimum cost based on the given input values.

Correctness: **True**
