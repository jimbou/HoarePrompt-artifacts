This function reads input from the standard input, processes it in blocks, and prints 'YES' or 'NO' to the console for each block. Each block consists of an integer n followed by n integers. The function checks if it's possible to distribute the sum of the n integers equally among n people. If it's possible, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for a number of blocks specified by the first integer input.
