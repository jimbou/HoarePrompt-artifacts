The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The input `t` is read from the standard input, so the standard input will now contain `t-1` blocks of two lines each, where the first line of each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

The output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` blocks of two lines each, where the first line of each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
