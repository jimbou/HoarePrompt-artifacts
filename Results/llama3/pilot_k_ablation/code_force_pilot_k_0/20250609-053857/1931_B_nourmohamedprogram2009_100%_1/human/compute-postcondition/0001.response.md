Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations will be a series of 'YES' or 'NO' printed to the console, each corresponding to whether it is possible to balance the water in the bottles for each test case. The number of 'YES' or 'NO' printed will be equal to the value of `t-1`. The value of `t` will remain unchanged.
