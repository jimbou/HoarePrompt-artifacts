Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from the standard input, which consists of multiple blocks of two lines each. The first line of each block contains an integer `n`, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.

2. The program calculates the total amount of water `total_water` by summing up all the integers in the second line of each block. It then calculates the target amount of water `target` that each container should have by dividing `total_water` by `n`.

3. The program initializes a variable `current_balance` to 0 and a boolean variable `possible` to True. It then iterates over the integers in the second line of each block. For each integer `a_i`, it adds `a_i - target` to `current_balance`. If `current_balance` becomes negative at any point, it sets `possible` to False and breaks out of the loop.

4. After iterating over all the integers in the second line of each block, the program checks the value of `possible`. If `possible` is True, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to distribute the water equally among all containers. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct because it simulates the process of pouring water from one container to another. The `current_balance` variable keeps track of the net amount of water that has been poured from the left containers to the right containers. If `current_balance` becomes negative at any point, it means that there is not enough water in the left containers to pour into the right containers, so it is not possible to distribute the water equally.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
