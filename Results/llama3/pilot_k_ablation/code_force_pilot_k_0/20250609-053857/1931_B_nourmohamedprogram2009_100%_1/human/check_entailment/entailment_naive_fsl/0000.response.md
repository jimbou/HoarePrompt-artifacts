Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. The key insight is that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same if and only if the total amount of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers.

The program calculates the target amount of water in each container by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers. It then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the current balance of water. If at any point the current balance becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

If the program completes the loop without setting `possible` to `False`, it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the total amount of water is 0. It also correctly handles cases where the amount of water in some containers is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
