#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the integer n, where n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the sum of the digits of a given integer n, where n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).
