Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Vladislav wrote the integers from 1 to n, inclusive, on the board, but the program only calculates the sum of the digits for numbers up to 12. It does not handle cases where n is greater than 12.

For example, if n = 20, the program will not calculate the sum of the digits for numbers 13 to 20, which is not in line with the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
