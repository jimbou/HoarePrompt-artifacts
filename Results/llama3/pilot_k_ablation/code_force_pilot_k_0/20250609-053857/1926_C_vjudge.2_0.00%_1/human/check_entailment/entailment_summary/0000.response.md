Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect because it does not match the problem description. The problem asks to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given number n. However, the program provided only calculates the sum of the digits for numbers from 0 to 12, and does not take into account the input number n.

The program also does not handle the number of test cases (t) and does not output the result for each test case as required by the problem. The execution summary also does not match the problem description, as it only describes the functionality of the func_1 function, which is not the main function that solves the problem.

Correctness: **False**
