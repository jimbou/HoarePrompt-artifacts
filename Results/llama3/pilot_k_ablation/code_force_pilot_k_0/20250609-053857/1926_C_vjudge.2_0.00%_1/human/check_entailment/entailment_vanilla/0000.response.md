Reasoning:

The provided program is incorrect for several reasons:

1.  The program does not read the input as specified in the problem description. It should read the number of test cases `t` and then read `t` integers, each representing the value of `n` for a test case. However, the program does not include any code to read input.

2.  The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n`, which is correct. However, this function is not used correctly in the context of the problem.

3.  The program uses a loop that runs 13 times, calling `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12. This is not related to the problem description, which requires calculating the sum of the sums of digits for numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is provided as input.

4.  The program prints the sum of the results of `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12, which is not the desired output according to the problem description.

5.  The program does not handle multiple test cases as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
