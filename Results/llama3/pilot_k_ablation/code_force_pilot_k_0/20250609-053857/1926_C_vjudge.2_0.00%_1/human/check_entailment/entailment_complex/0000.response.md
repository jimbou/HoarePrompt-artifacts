Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for all integers from 1 to n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the integer n itself, not the sum of the digits of all integers from 1 to n.

The program should iterate over all integers from 1 to n, calculate the sum of the digits of each integer, and add it to the total sum. The provided program only calls the function `func_1` with the argument `i` in the range 13, which is not related to the input `n`.

Moreover, the program prints the sum of the digits of the integers from 0 to 12, which is not the desired output.

Correctness: **False**
