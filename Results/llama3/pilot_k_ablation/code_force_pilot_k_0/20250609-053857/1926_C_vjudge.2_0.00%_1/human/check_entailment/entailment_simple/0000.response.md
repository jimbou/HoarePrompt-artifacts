Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given integer n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the integer n itself, not the sum of the numbers on the board.

The program calls the function func_1(i) in a loop from 0 to 12, and sums up the results. However, this loop is not related to the input n, and the function func_1(i) only calculates the sum of the digits of the integer i, not the sum of the numbers on the board.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should iterate over the numbers from 1 to n, calculate the sum of the digits of each number, and sum up these results.

Correctness: **False**
