Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing three integers n, a, and b, which are the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.
