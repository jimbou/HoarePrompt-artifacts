Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum profit Bob can obtain by selling all n buns. The program iterates through each test case, calculates the maximum profit by considering the optimal value of k (the number of buns sold at a modified price), and prints the result.

The program correctly handles the cases where a >= b, in which case the maximum profit is simply n * a. When a < b, the program calculates the optimal value of k as the minimum of b - a and n - 1. It then calculates the maximum profit by adding the additional profit from selling k buns at a modified price to the base profit of n * a.

The program also correctly handles the case where k is 0, in which case the maximum profit is simply n * a.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
