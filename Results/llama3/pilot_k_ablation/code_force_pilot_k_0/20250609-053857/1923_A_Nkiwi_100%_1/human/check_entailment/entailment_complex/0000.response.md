Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips in a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the ribbon and the state of each cell (0 for free, 1 for chip). It then finds the first and last occurrence of a chip in the ribbon, counts the number of free cells between these two occurrences, and prints this count.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the first and last occurrence of a chip in the ribbon by iterating from the start and end of the array until it finds a chip. It then counts the number of free cells between these two occurrences by iterating over the subarray between the first and last chip.

The program's output is also correct. The number of free cells between the first and last occurrence of a chip is the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block without any free cells between them.

Therefore, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
