Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, including the number of cells (n) and the array of cells (arrs).
2. It correctly finds the first and last occurrence of a chip (1) in the array by iterating from the start and end of the array, respectively, until it finds a non-zero value.
3. It correctly counts the number of free cells (0) between the first and last occurrence of a chip by iterating through the subarray between these two indices and incrementing a counter for each zero value.
4. It correctly prints the count of free cells for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the example inputs and outputs demonstrate the program's correctness.

Correctness: **True**
