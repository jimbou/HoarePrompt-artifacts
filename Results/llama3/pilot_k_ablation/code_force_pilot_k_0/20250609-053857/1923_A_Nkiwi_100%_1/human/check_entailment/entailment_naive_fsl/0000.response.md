Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first finds the start and end indices of the block of chips by iterating through the array from both ends until it finds a non-zero element.
2. It then counts the number of zeros within this block, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the block of chips is already contiguous (in which case the output is 0) or when there are multiple blocks of chips (in which case the program only considers the first block).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
