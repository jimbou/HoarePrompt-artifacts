Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the length of the array `length` and the array `arrs` itself.
3.  It then finds the start index `sIdx` and end index `eIdx` of the first and last occurrence of 1 in the array, respectively. This is done by iterating from the start and end of the array until it finds the first and last 1.
4.  After finding the start and end indices, it counts the number of zeros `cnt0` between these indices. This is done by iterating over the array from `sIdx` to `eIdx` and incrementing the count whenever it encounters a 0.
5.  Finally, it prints the count of zeros `cnt0`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

The program's logic is correct because it accurately identifies the start and end indices of the block of 1s and then counts the number of zeros between these indices. This count represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

Correctness: **True**
