Functionality: **The function reads an integer t from standard input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n and an array of n integers, where 0 represents a free cell and 1 represents a cell containing a chip. The function then finds the first and last occurrence of a chip (1) in the array, counts the number of free cells (0) between these two occurrences, and prints this count. The function repeats this process for all t test cases, leaving the value of t unchanged.**
