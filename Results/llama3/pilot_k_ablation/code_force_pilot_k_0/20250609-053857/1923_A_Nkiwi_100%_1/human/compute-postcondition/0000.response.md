Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) where a_i = 0 means the i-th cell is free and a_i = 1 means the i-th cell contains a chip. In each test case, at least one cell contains a chip.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 1000, which was read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer `n` between 2 and 50, and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where each `a_i` is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the i-th cell is free or contains a chip, respectively. Note that at least one cell in each test case contains a chip.
