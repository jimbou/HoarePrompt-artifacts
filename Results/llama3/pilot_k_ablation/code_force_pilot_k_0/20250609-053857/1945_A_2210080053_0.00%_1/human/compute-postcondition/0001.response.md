Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three integers representing the number of introverts, extroverts, and universals. It considers universals as extroverts, calculates the new number of introverts and extroverts, and prints the result. If the number of universals is less than the remainder of the total extroverts divided by 3, it prints -1 instead. The function iterates through all test cases and provides the corresponding output for each case.**
