Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y, and output them in that order.
2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `n` from the input.
3. It then iterates `n` times, reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input in each iteration.
4. Inside the loop, it checks the conditions:
   - If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `a` and `b` (since `a` is the minimum and `b` is the maximum).
   - If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `a` and `b` (since both are equal, and it doesn't matter which one is printed first).
   - If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `b` and `a` (since `b` is the minimum and `a` is the maximum).
5. The program correctly handles all possible cases for the input values of `a` and `b`, and outputs the minimum and maximum values in the required order.

Correctness: **True**
