Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum of two given integers. The program reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads two integers, sorts them in ascending order, and prints the sorted pair.

The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the two integers. If a is less than b, it prints a and b. If a is equal to b, it prints a and b (since they are the same). If a is greater than b, it prints b and a.

The execution summary confirms that the program reads pairs of integers, sorts them in ascending order, and prints the sorted pairs.

Based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program correctly implements the required logic.

Correctness: **True**
