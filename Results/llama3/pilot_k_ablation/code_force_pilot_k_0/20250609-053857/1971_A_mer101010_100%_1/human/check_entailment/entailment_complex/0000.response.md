Reasoning:

The given program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, sort each pair in ascending order, and print the sorted pairs to standard output. The program correctly implements this functionality.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `n` from standard input and initializes a variable `t` to 0, which is not used anywhere in the program. This is not an issue, as the variable `t` is not necessary for the program's functionality.

2. The program then enters a loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` from standard input using the `map` function.

3. The program then uses an if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the integers `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `a` and `b` in that order. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `a` and `b` in that order (which is the same order, since they are equal). If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `b` and `a` in that order.

4. The program repeats this process for all `n` test cases.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program correctly implements the required functionality. It reads pairs of integers, sorts them in ascending order, and prints the sorted pairs to standard output.

Correctness: **True**
