Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly identifies the minimum and maximum of two integers x and y for all possible cases. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to compare the values of x and y and print the minimum followed by the maximum. The program handles all possible cases, including when x is less than y, when x is equal to y, and when x is greater than y.

The program also correctly handles the input format, reading the number of test cases and then reading two space-separated integers for each test case. The program uses the map function to convert the input strings to integers, which is correct.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as when x and y are equal, or when x and y are both 0. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
