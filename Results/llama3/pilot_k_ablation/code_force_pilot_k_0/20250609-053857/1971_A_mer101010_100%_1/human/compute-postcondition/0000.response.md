Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, which is the input from stdin. The value of `t` is 0, which is assigned in the second line of the code. Stdin still contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, with values between 0 and 9 inclusive.
