Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the process described in the problem statement to calculate the minimum possible penalty. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program splits the input array into two subsequences 'a' and 'b' based on whether each element is greater than the previous element in 'a'. This is done by iterating through the input array and appending each element to either 'a' or 'b' based on the comparison.

2. The program then counts the number of times an element in both 'a' and 'b' is greater than its previous element. This is done by iterating through both 'a' and 'b' and incrementing the count 's' whenever an element is greater than its previous element.

3. Finally, the program prints the total count 's' for each test case, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
