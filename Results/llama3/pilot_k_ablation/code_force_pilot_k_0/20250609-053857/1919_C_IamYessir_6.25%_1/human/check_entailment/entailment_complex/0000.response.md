Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to split the input array into two subsequences 'a' and 'b' such that every element of the array is either in 'a' or 'b'. The program then calculates the penalty for each subsequence by counting the number of times an element is greater than its previous element, considering only the elements in increasing order. The total penalty is then printed for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the input array has only one element or where all elements in the array are equal. In these cases, the program correctly outputs 0 as the total penalty.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has multiple elements and some elements are greater than their previous elements. In this case, the program correctly splits the array into two subsequences and calculates the total penalty.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
