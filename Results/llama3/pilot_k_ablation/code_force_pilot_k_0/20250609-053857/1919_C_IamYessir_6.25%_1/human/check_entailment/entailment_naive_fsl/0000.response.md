Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is [3, 1, 4, 1, 5], the program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1. The program does not correctly split the array into two subsequences to minimize the penalty.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the current element is smaller than the last element in both subsequences. In this case, the program should add the current element to the subsequence with the smaller last element, but the program does not do this. Instead, it always adds the current element to the first subsequence if it is smaller than the last element in the first subsequence, and to the second subsequence otherwise. This can lead to incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to correctly handle the case where the current element is smaller than the last element in both subsequences. One possible solution is to keep track of the last element in both subsequences and add the current element to the subsequence with the smaller last element.
