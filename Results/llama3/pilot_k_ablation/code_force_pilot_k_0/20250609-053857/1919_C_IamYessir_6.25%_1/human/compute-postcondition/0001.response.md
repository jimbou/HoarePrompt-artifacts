Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It separates the list into two lists, 'a' and 'b', based on whether each element is greater than the previous element in 'a'. Then, it counts the number of times an element in both lists is greater than its previous element, considering only the elements in increasing order. Finally, it prints the total count for each test case.**
