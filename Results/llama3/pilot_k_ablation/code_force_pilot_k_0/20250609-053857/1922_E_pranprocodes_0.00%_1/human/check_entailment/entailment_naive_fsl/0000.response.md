Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3, the program outputs "2 1", but the correct output should be "1 0 1" or "0 1 0" because these arrays have exactly 3 increasing subsequences.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when x is odd. When x is odd, the program subtracts 1 from x and adds the minimum value to the answer. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting array will have exactly x increasing subsequences.

For instance, when x is 3, the program outputs "2 1", but this array has only 2 increasing subsequences: [2] and [1]. The correct output should be "1 0 1" or "0 1 0", which have exactly 3 increasing subsequences: [1], [0], and [1, 0].

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
