This function reads a series of integers from standard input, applies a transformation to each integer based on whether it is even or odd, and prints the result. For each integer, it generates a sequence of integers by iteratively applying the transformation until the integer becomes 1. The transformation involves decrementing a maximum value (initially 100,000,000) for even integers and incrementing a minimum value (initially -100,000,000) for odd integers. The function then prints the number of iterations performed for each integer, followed by the generated sequence of integers. The function processes multiple integers, with the number of integers specified by the first input integer.
