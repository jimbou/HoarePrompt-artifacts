Output State: **The output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of t number of lines, each containing a single integer, and t number of lines, each containing a sequence of integers. The value of t is the input integer provided in the first line of the input. The sequence of integers in each line is the result of the loop's execution, where each integer is either max or min, depending on whether the input integer x is even or odd, respectively. The value of max and min is updated in each iteration of the loop, with max decreasing by 1 and min increasing by 1. The loop continues until x becomes 1.**
