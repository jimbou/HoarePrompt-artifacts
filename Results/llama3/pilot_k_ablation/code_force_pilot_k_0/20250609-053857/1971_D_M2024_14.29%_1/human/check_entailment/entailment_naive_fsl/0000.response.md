Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program works by iterating through the input string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This is because in a sorted binary string, all '0's come before all '1's, so any '1' followed by a '0' indicates a point where the string needs to be cut. The program then adds 1 to this count, because even if there are no '1's followed by '0's, the string still needs to be cut into at least one piece (the entire string itself). This approach correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the input string is already sorted or contains only one character.
