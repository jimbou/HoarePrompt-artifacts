Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of cuts required to split each binary string into substrings of consecutive 1's and 0's, which can then be rearranged into a sorted binary string.

The program works by iterating through each string and counting the number of times a '1' is followed by a '0'. This is because each such occurrence requires a cut to separate the '1' and '0' into different substrings. The program then adds 1 to this count, because even if there are no '1's followed by '0's, a single cut is still required to separate the '1's from the '0's (or vice versa).

The program's output matches the expected output for the given example inputs, and its logic is sound. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
