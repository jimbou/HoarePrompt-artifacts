Output State: **n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single element 0.**

The code executes as follows:

1. `n, q = func_1(int)`: This line calls the function `func_1` with the argument `int` and assigns the returned values to `n` and `q`. Since `func_1` is defined to return the expected values, `n` and `q` become positive integers.

2. `a = list(func_1(int))`: This line calls the function `func_1` with the argument `int` and assigns the returned value to `a`. Since `func_1` is defined to return the expected values, `a` becomes a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30.

3. `x = [0]`: This line assigns a list containing a single element 0 to `x`.

4. `inds = defaultdict(list)`: This line creates a new dictionary `inds` with a default value of an empty list.

5. `inds[0].append(0)`: This line adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary `inds` where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single element 0.

After executing all the lines, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` and `q` are positive integers.
* `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30.
* `x` is a list containing a single element 0.
* `inds` is a dictionary with a single key-value pair where the key is 0 and the value is a list containing a single element 0.

Note that the function `func_2` is not used in this code snippet, so its definition is not relevant to the output state.
