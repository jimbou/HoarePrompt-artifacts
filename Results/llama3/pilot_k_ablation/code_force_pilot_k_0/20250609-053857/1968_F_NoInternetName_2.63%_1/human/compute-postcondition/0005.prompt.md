You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, and the function func_1 and func_2 are defined and return the expected values.
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, inds is a dictionary with keys that are non-negative integers less than 2^30 and values that are lists of non-negative integers less than 2^30.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed q iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the exception that the loop variables i, l, and r have been updated to their final values after the last iteration. The values of n, a, x, and inds remain unchanged.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
