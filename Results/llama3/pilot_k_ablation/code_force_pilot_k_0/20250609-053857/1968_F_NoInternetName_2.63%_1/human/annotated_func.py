#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() is a function that returns a string of space-separated values.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each string in the list of space-separated values returned by the input() function, converting each string to a value of a specific type.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of space-separated values as input, splits it into individual strings, applies a specified cast function to each string to convert it to a specific type, and returns a map object containing the converted values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2

            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: l is the index of the first element in `arr` that satisfies the `predicate` function, or the length of `arr` if no such element exists.
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns the index of the first element in `arr` that satisfies the `predicate` function, or the length of `arr` if no such element exists.
    #State: *l is the index of the first element in `arr` that satisfies the `predicate` function, or the length of `arr` if no such element exists. The element at index `l` in `arr` does not satisfy the `predicate` function
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches for the first element in a list that satisfies a given predicate function and returns its index, or the length of the list if no such element exists. If the first element that satisfies the predicate is not the first element in the list, returns None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, and the function func_1 and func_2 are defined and return the expected values.
    n, q = func_1(int)

        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: Output State: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, inds is a dictionary with keys that are non-negative integers less than 2^30 and values that are lists of non-negative integers less than 2^30.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1

        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: Output State: The loop has executed q iterations, and the output state is the same as the initial state, with the exception that the loop variables i, l, and r have been updated to their final values after the last iteration. The values of n, a, x, and inds remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array 'a' that has a specific XOR property. It takes no explicit parameters but uses the values of 'n', 'q', 'a', and functions 'func_1' and 'func_2' from the outer scope. The function iterates 'q' times, each time checking if there is a subarray between indices 'l' and 'r' (inclusive) where the XOR of all elements is equal to the XOR of the elements before 'l' and after 'r'. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function maintains a dictionary 'inds' to efficiently find indices of specific XOR values, and it uses the 'func_2' function to find the first index in 'inds' that satisfies a given condition. The function does not modify the input array 'a' or the values of 'n' and 'q'.
