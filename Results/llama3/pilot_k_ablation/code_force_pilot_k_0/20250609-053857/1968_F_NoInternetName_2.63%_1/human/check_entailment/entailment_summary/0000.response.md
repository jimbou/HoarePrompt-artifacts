Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, and the queries.

2. The program correctly calculates the XOR of the elements in the array and stores the results in the `x` list.

3. The program correctly uses the `inds` dictionary to store the indices of the XOR values. This allows for efficient lookup of indices with specific XOR values.

4. The program correctly checks if the XOR of the elements in the subarray is equal to the XOR of the elements before and after the subarray. If they are equal, it prints "Yes".

5. The program correctly uses the `func_2` function to find the first index in the `inds` dictionary that satisfies the given condition. This is used to find the lower and upper bounds of the subarray.

6. The program correctly checks if the subarray exists within the bounds of the array and if the XOR of the elements in the subarray is equal to the XOR of the elements before and after the subarray. If both conditions are met, it prints "Yes".

7. The program correctly handles the case where the subarray does not exist or the XOR of the elements in the subarray is not equal to the XOR of the elements before and after the subarray. In this case, it prints "No".

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray exists with the specified XOR property, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
