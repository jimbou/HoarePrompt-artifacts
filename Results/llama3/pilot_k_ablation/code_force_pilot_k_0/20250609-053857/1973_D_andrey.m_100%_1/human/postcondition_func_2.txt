This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and attempts to find a value m such that a sequence of k operations, each incrementing a counter by m, will result in a final value of n. If such a value is found, the function calls another function func_2 with the value m. If no such value is found, the function calls func_2 with the value -1. The function modifies the input variables n and k, and also uses the standard input, which is expected to be empty at the end of the function's execution.
