Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive problem described in the problem statement. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value m such that the array can be split into exactly k subarrays with the product of their length and maximum equal to m.

The program first finds the maximum value that can be obtained by multiplying the length of the array and its maximum value. It then iterates over all possible values of m in descending order, starting from the maximum value found earlier. For each value of m, it checks if it is possible to split the array into exactly k subarrays with the product of their length and maximum equal to m. If it is possible, it prints the value of m and returns. If it is not possible for any value of m, it prints -1.

The program uses two helper functions, func_1 and func_2, to interact with the grader. func_1 is used to ask the grader for the smallest positive integer r such that f(l, r) = x, and func_2 is used to print the answer.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats specified in the problem statement. It reads the input from the standard input, prints the queries and answers to the standard output, and flushes the output buffer after each print statement to ensure that the output is displayed immediately.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
