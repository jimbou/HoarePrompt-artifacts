Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the maximum value `max_val` is not found in the first iteration of the loop in `func_3()`. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum value `m` and will not find the correct split of the array.

For example, if the input is `n = 5` and `k = 2`, and the hidden array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the program will not find the correct split `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5]` because it will not correctly calculate the maximum value `m`.

The program should be modified to handle this case, for example, by iterating over all possible values of `m` and checking if the split is correct.
