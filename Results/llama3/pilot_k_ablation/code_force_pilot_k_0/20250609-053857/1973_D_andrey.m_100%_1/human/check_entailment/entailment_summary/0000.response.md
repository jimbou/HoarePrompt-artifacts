Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value m such that a sequence of k operations, each incrementing a counter by m, will result in a final value of n. The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4.

func_1 takes two positive integers l and x as input, prints them to the console, waits for user input, and returns the integer value entered by the user. This function is used to query the hidden array.

func_2 prints an exclamation mark followed by a positive integer m to the console, waits for user input, and returns the input as an integer. This function is used to submit the answer.

func_3 is the main function that attempts to find the value m. It takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. It first finds the maximum value max_val such that f(1, n) = max_val * n. Then, it iterates over possible values of m, starting from n // k * max_val and decreasing by 1 in each iteration. For each m, it checks if there exists a sequence of k operations, each incrementing a counter by m, that results in a final value of n. If such a value is found, it calls func_2 with the value m. If no such value is found, it calls func_2 with the value -1.

func_4 reads a positive integer from standard input and executes a loop that calls func_3 a number of times equal to the input integer, until the input is exhausted.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the largest value m such that a sequence of k operations, each incrementing a counter by m, will result in a final value of n. It uses the query function func_1 to get information about the hidden array and the submit function func_2 to submit the answer. The main function func_3 correctly iterates over possible values of m and checks if there exists a sequence of k operations that results in a final value of n.

Correctness: **True**
