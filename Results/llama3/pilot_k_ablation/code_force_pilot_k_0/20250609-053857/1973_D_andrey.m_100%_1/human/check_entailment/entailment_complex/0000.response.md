Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value m such that a sequence of k operations, each incrementing a counter by m, will result in a final value of n. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value m.

The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4. 

- func_1 takes two positive integers l and x as input, prints them to the console, waits for user input, and returns the integer value entered by the user. This function is used to query the hidden array.

- func_2 prints an exclamation mark followed by a positive integer m to the console, waits for user input, and returns the input as an integer. This function is used to submit the answer.

- func_3 is the main function that attempts to find the value m. It first reads two positive integers n and k from the input, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. It then iterates from n to 1 to find the maximum value max_val such that the product of max_val and n is equal to the product of max_val and the length of the subarray. 

- After finding max_val, the function iterates from n // k to 1 to find the value m such that the product of m and k is equal to the product of max_val and n. If such a value is found, the function calls func_2 with the value m. If no such value is found, the function calls func_2 with the value -1.

- func_4 reads a positive integer t from the input and executes a loop that calls func_3 a number of times equal to the input integer.

The program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum value m. It also correctly handles the cases where no such value m exists. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
