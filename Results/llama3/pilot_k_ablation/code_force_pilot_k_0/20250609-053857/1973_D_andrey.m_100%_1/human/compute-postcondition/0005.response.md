Output State: **The value of `func_2(-1)` has been returned, n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^4, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= n, max_val is a positive integer such that 1 <= max_val <= n, stdin is empty, i is an integer such that 0 <= i < n // k, m is an integer such that 0 <= m < max_val * n // k, p is an integer such that 0 <= p < n.**

In natural language, the output state is that the function `func_2(-1)` has been executed and its return value has been obtained. The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `max_val`, `i`, `m`, and `p` remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty.
