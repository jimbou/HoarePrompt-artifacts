Output State: **The output state is a series of lines, each containing either a sequence of '1's separated by spaces or '-1'. The number of lines is equal to the value of t in the initial state. If n equals k in a line, the output is a sequence of '1's repeated n times. Otherwise, the output is '-1'.**
