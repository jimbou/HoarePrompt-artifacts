Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, if n equals k, it prints a sequence of '1's repeated n times, separated by spaces. Otherwise, it prints '-1'. The function processes all test cases and outputs the results accordingly.**
