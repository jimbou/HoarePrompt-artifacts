Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by checking if the number of cyclic shifts (n) is equal to the number of sorted cyclic shifts (k). If they are equal, it prints a string of '1's separated by spaces, which represents an array of 1's of length n. This is because an array of all 1's will have all its cyclic shifts sorted.

However, the program does not handle the case where n is not equal to k. In this case, it simply prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array. But the problem statement allows for the possibility of having a valid array with k sorted cyclic shifts, where k is less than n.

For example, for the input (3, 1), the program prints -1, but a valid array is [69420, 69, 420], which has only one sorted cyclic shift.

Therefore, the program is not correct for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **False**
