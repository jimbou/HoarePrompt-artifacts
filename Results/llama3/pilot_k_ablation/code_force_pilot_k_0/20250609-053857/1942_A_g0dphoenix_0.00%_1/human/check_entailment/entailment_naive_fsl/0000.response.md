Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program should output a valid array a that satisfies the requirements, but instead, it outputs -1. However, a valid array a can be [69420, 69, 420], which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift.

The program only handles the case when n = k, and for all other cases, it outputs -1 without checking if a valid array a exists. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
