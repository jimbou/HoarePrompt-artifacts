Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem. The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only checks if `n` equals `k` and prints a sequence of '1's if true, or '-1' if false.

The program does not consider the case where `k` is less than `n`, which is a valid scenario according to the problem description. In such cases, the program should print an array that satisfies the condition, but instead, it prints '-1'.

Moreover, the program does not generate an array that satisfies the condition when `k` is less than `n`. It simply prints '-1' without attempting to find a valid solution.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not fully address the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**
