Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n satisfying two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n
2. Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a, exactly k of them are sorted.

However, the program only checks if n equals k and prints a sequence of '1's repeated n times if true, or '-1' otherwise. This does not guarantee that the output array satisfies the second condition.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints '-1', but a valid solution exists: [69420, 69, 420]. The three cyclic shifts of this array are [69420, 69, 420], [69, 420, 69420], and [420, 69420, 69], and only the first one is sorted.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
