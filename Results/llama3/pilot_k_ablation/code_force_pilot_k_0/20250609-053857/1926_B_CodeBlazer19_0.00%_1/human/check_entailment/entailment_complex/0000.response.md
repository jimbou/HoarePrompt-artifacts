Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it prints 'Triangle'. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

Moreover, the program checks if any row contains more than one '1' and if so, it prints 'Square'. However, this condition is not sufficient to determine if the shape is a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program does not check these conditions, and therefore, it may print incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
