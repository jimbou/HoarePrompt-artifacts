Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and prints 'Triangle' if so, otherwise it prints 'Square'. However, this logic is not sufficient to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square.

A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row. Similarly, a square can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's remains the same in each row.

The program does not check for these conditions, and therefore, it may incorrectly identify a triangle as a square or vice versa.

Correctness: **False**
