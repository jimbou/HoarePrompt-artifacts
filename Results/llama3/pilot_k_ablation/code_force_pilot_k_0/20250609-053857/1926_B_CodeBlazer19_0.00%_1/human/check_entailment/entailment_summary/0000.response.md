Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The logic used to determine whether the shape is a triangle or a square is flawed. The program checks if any string contains exactly one '1' and if so, it prints 'Triangle'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

Moreover, the program checks if any string contains more than one '1' and if so, it prints 'Square'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square must have the same number of '1's in each row, and the '1's must be positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program does not take into account the structure of the shape, it only checks the number of '1's in each row. Therefore, it may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
