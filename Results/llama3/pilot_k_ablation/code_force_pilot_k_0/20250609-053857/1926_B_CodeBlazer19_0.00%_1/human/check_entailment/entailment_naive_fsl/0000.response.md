Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The issue lies in the way it checks for triangles and squares. The program assumes that if a row has more than one '1', it must be a square, and if a row has only one '1', it must be a triangle. However, this is not sufficient to correctly identify the shape.

For example, consider the following grid:

```
000
011
011
```

This grid forms a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because the second and third rows have more than one '1'.

To correctly identify the shape, the program needs to check the pattern of '1's in the grid, not just the count of '1's in each row. It needs to check if the '1's form a triangle or a square shape, which requires a more complex algorithm than the one implemented in the program.
