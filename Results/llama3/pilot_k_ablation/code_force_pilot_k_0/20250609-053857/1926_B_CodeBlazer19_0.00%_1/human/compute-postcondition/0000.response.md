The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, each starting with an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of strings. Since the code only reads the first integer from the stdin, the remaining test cases are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10), stdin contains multiple test cases, each starting with t-1 lines of strings of t characters '0' or '1'.**
