This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n strings of n characters each. It then checks each string for the presence of '1' characters. If any string contains exactly one '1', it prints 'Triangle'. If no string contains exactly one '1' but at least one string contains more than one '1', it prints 'Square'. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding shape for each case, leaving the input variable t unchanged.
