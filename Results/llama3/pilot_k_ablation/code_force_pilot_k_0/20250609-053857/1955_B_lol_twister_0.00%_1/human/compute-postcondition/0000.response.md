The code sorts the list `l` in ascending order. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `b_i` in `l`.**
