You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c and d are integers greater than or equal to 1, l is a list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l.
    l.sort()
    if (not l[-1] - l[0] == (n - 1) * (c + d)) :
        return 'no'
        #The program returns the string 'no'
    #State: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `b_i` in `l`. The difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is not equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`
    a = l[0] + l[-1]
    r = n ** 2 // 2
    if (n % 2 != 0) :
        if (not l[r] == a // 2) :
            return 'NO'
            #The program returns the string 'NO'.
        #State: *n is an odd integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l. The difference between the last element and the first element of l is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 // 2. The middle element of l (l[r]) is equal to half of a
    #State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l. The difference between the last element and the first element of l is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 // 2. If n is odd, the middle element of l (l[r]) is equal to half of a
    for k in range(r):
        if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
            return 'no'
        
    #State: The loop will return 'no' if there is at least one pair of elements at mirrored positions in the list that are not equal, otherwise, it will return None. The values of n, c, d, a, and r remain unchanged. The list l remains unchanged.
    return 'yes'
    #The program returns 'yes'. The values of n, c, d, a, and r remain unchanged. The list l remains unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the string 'no'

Case_2: *n is an odd integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l. The difference between the last element and the first element of l is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 // 2. The middle element of l (l[r]) is equal to half of a

Case_3: The program returns 'yes'. The values of n, c, d, a, and r remain unchanged. The list l remains unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
