Functionality: **This function checks if a given list of integers satisfies certain conditions and returns 'yes' if the conditions are met, 'no' if the conditions are not met, and 'NO' if the middle element of the list does not match a specific value when the list length is odd. The function takes as input a list of integers and three integers, and it returns a string indicating whether the conditions are satisfied or not.**
