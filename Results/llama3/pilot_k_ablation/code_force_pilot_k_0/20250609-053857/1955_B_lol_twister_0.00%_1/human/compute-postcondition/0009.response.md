Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l. The difference between the last element and the first element of l is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 // 2. If n is odd, the middle element of l (l[r]) is equal to half of a***
