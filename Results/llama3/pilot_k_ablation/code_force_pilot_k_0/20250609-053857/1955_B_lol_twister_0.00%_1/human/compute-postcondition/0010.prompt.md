Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, c is an integer greater than or equal to 1, d is an integer greater than or equal to 1, l is a sorted list of n^2 integers such that 1 <= b_i <= 10^9 for all b_i in l. The difference between the last element and the first element of l is not equal to (n - 1) * (c + d), a is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, r is an integer equal to n^2 // 2. If n is odd, the middle element of l (l[r]) is equal to half of a
Code of the loop:
for k in range(r):
    if not l[k] == l[-1 - k]:
        return 'no'


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
