Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers such that 1 <= `b_i` <= 10^9 for all `b_i` in `l`. The difference between the last element and the first element of `l` is not equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`***
