Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One case where the program fails is when the input array `l` contains duplicate elements. In this case, the program will incorrectly identify the progressive square as valid even if it is not.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8 8
```

In this case, the program will output "YES" even though the array `l` contains duplicate elements (8 appears twice), which is not allowed in a progressive square.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`, and if the middle element of the sorted array is equal to the average of the maximum and minimum elements. However, it does not check if the array contains duplicate elements, which is a necessary condition for a progressive square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
