Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, consider the input:

4
>><<
>><>

The program will print 'YES', but the robot cannot reach the cell (2, 4) because it will get stuck in an infinite loop between cells (1, 2) and (2, 2).

The issue with the program is that it only checks if there are any pairs of cells in the same column that both point to the left, but it does not consider the case where the robot can move up or down and then follow an arrow that points to the left. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to simulate the robot's movement and check if it can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    for j in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())
        a = input()
        b = input()
        visited = set()
        stack = [(0, 0)]
        while stack:
            x, y = stack.pop()
            if (x, y) == (1, n - 1):
                print('YES')
                break
            if (x, y) in visited:
                continue
            visited.add((x, y))
            if x == 0:
                if a[y] == '>':
                    stack.append((x, y + 1))
                else:
                    stack.append((x, y - 1))
                stack.append((x + 1, y))
            else:
                if b[y] == '>':
                    stack.append((x, y + 1))
                else:
                    stack.append((x, y - 1))
                stack.append((x - 1, y))
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This implementation uses a stack to simulate the robot's movement and checks if it can reach the cell (2, n) by following the arrows. If the robot can reach the cell (2, n), it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
