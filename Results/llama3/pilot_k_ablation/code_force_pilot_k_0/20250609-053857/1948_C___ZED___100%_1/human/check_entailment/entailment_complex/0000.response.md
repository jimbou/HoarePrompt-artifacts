Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` and two strings `a` and `b` of length `n`.
2.  It then checks for the condition that would prevent the robot from reaching the cell `(2, n)`. This condition is when there are two consecutive cells in the same row with arrows pointing to the left (`'<'`), either horizontally adjacent (`a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'`) or vertically adjacent (`a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`).
3.  If this condition is found, the program immediately prints `'NO'` and breaks out of the loop, moving on to the next test case.
4.  If the loop completes without finding this condition, the program prints `'YES'`, indicating that the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)`.
5.  The program correctly handles multiple test cases and prints the result for each case on a separate line.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the cell `(2, n)` based on the given grid and arrow directions.

Correctness: **True**
