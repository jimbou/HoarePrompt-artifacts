Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program iterates over each test case, reading the number of columns `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the grid.
*   It then checks for each pair of columns (starting from the second column, since the robot starts at column 1) whether there is a situation where the robot cannot move forward. This happens when the arrows in the current column and the next column in both rows point to the left (`a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`).
*   If such a situation is found, the program prints 'NO' and moves on to the next test case.
*   If no such situation is found after checking all pairs of columns, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the robot can reach the last column.

The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the robot can reach the last column based on the given constraints and arrow configurations.

Correctness: **True**
