Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a robot can reach the cell (2, n) in a grid with 2 rows and n columns, where each cell contains an arrow pointing either left or right. The robot moves left, right, down, or up, and then follows the arrow in the current cell.

The program iterates over each test case, reading the number of columns (n) and the two strings representing the arrows in the grid. It then checks for a specific condition: if there is a pair of arrows pointing left ('<') in the same column, either in the same row or in adjacent rows, it prints 'NO'. If no such pair is found, it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is based on the observation that if there is a pair of arrows pointing left in the same column, the robot cannot reach the cell (2, n). This is because the robot would be forced to move left, and then follow the arrow, which would also point left, creating an infinite loop.

The program's implementation is correct, as it accurately checks for the specified condition and prints the correct result for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
