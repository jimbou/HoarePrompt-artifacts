This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks if the strings satisfy a specific condition, printing 'YES' if they do and 'NO' if they don't. The function processes multiple test cases and prints the result for each case on a separate line, without modifying the input values.
