Output State: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than before**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1. The second line initializes an empty list `results`. No other variables are affected. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged, maintaining the condition that `start` is less than or equal to `end`.
