stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k. The second line contains a list of n distinct integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, where 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}. The third line contains a list of m integers d_1, d_2, ..., d_m, where 1 <= d_i <= 10^9. The fourth line contains a list of k integers f_1, f_2, ..., f_k, where 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
