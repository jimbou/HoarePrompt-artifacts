This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four lines of integers. It then calculates and prints the minimum distance between the start and end points of a gap in the first line of integers and the sum of an integer from the second line and an integer from the third line, such that the sum is within the gap. If no such sum is found within a gap, it prints the size of the gap instead. The function repeats this process for all test cases and outputs a list of integers, each representing the minimum distance or gap size for a test case.
