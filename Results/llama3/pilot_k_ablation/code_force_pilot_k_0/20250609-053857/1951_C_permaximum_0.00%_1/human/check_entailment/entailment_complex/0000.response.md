Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the prices per ticket for each of n days, and the constraint that a person can purchase no more than m tickets per day.

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. It sorts the prices in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted prices. For each price, it calculates the number of tickets to buy, which is the minimum of m and the remaining number of tickets to buy (k - tickets_bought). It then calculates the cost of buying these tickets and adds it to the total cost. This process continues until all k tickets have been bought.

Function 2, `func_2`, handles input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads three positive integers (n, m, k) and a list of n positive integers (prices). It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The sorting of prices ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which minimizes the total cost. The loop in `func_1` continues until all k tickets have been bought, ensuring that the total cost is calculated correctly.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The problem statement mentions that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x. But the program does not take this into account. It simply sorts the prices and buys the cheapest tickets first, without considering the effect of buying tickets on the prices of subsequent days.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
