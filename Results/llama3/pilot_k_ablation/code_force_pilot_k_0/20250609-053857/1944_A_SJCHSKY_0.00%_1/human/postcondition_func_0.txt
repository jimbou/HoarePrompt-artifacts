The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then calculates and prints the number of reachable nodes after a series of iterations, where in each iteration, the number of reachable nodes is decremented by 1 and k is reduced by the current number of reachable nodes minus 1, until k is less than the number of reachable nodes minus 1 or k becomes 0. The function repeats this process for each test case and outputs the final number of reachable nodes for each case.
