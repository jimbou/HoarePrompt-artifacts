Output State: **`qs` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.**

In this output state, `qs` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing two integers n and k, where n is between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and k is between 0 and the maximum possible number of pairs of distinct elements in a set of n elements (i.e., n * (n - 1) / 2).
