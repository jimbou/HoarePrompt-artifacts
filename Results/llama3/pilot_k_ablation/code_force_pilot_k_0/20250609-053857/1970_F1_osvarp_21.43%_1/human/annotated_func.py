    #State: The loop iterates t times, processing commands from the input. After each iteration, the state of the game is updated based on the commands.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function simulates a game where entities move on a grid and perform actions based on commands. It initializes the game state by reading input from stdin, including the grid size, grid elements, and commands. The function then processes the commands, updating the game state accordingly, and prints out events such as eliminations, goals, and catches of the golden snitch. Finally, it prints the final score of the game.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a pair of integers representing a position on the field, and goal is a list of two lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents a goal position on the field, with the first list containing the positions of the red goals and the second list containing the positions of the blue goals.
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns the value of 'res', which is 0 if the position 'pos' is in the red goals, 1 if the position 'pos' is in the blue goals, and -1 otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the goal status of a given position on a field. It checks if the position is in the red goals, blue goals, or neither, and returns a corresponding value: 0 for red goals, 1 for blue goals, and -1 for positions not in either goal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.', and the second character is either a digit (0-9) or 'G' or 'Q'.
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the first character of the string 'el' is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function evaluates a given two-character string 'el' and returns True if the first character is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', otherwise it returns False.
