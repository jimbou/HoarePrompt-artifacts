The code prints the final score of the game, which includes the updated values of the variables `points[0]` and `points[1]`. These variables represent the scores of the two teams or players in the game. The values of `points[0]` and `points[1]` are determined by the commands processed during the loop iterations, which update the state of the game.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the final scores of the two teams or players in the game)**
