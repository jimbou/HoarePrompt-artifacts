Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in the wrong goal, the other team wins a point. However, in the program, when a player scores in the wrong goal, it simply prints the name of the team who wins one point, but it does not update the score correctly.

For example, if the input is:

5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T

The program will print:

6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1

However, the correct output should be:

6 BLUE GOAL
12 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 2

Because the red player scored in the wrong goal, the blue team should win two points, not one.
