Output State: **The output state is a series of pairs of integers, where each pair consists of two numbers that are the result of comparing corresponding digits of the input pairs. The comparison is done in a way that the smaller digit is assigned to the first number and the larger digit is assigned to the second number, but with a twist: if the digits are different, the assignment is swapped in every other iteration. The output state has the same number of pairs as the initial state, but with the modified digits.**
