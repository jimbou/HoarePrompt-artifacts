Functionality: This function takes an integer t as input, representing the number of pairs of integers to process. For each pair, it compares corresponding digits and assigns the smaller digit to the first number and the larger digit to the second number, but with a twist: if the digits are different, the assignment is swapped in every other iteration. The function then prints the modified pairs of integers, with the same number of pairs as the initial input.
