The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `int(input())` to `t`, where `input()` accepts an integer from the stdin and `int` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) first, and that integer is assigned to t. So stdin now contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, where x and y are non-negative integers of the same length, consisting only of digits from 1 to 9.**
