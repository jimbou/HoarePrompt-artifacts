Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`.

From the initial state, we know that `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
