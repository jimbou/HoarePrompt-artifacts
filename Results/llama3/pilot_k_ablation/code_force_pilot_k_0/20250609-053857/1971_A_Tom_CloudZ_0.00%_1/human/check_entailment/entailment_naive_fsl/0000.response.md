Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The problem description requires the output to be in the format "minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y", but the program prints the maximum first and then the minimum.

For example, if the input is "1 9", the program will print "9 1", which is incorrect. The correct output should be "1 9".

The program should be modified to print the minimum first and then the maximum, like this:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        print(min(a, b), max(a, b))
```
