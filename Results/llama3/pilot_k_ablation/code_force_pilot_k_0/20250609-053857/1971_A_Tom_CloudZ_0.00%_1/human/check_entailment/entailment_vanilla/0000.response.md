Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`.
4. The program then prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b` using `print(max(a, b), min(a, b))`.

However, the problem statement specifically asks to output the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. The program does the opposite, printing the maximum first and then the minimum.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
