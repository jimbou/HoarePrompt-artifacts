Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, determine the maximum and minimum values in each pair, and print the maximum value followed by the minimum value for each pair. However, the problem statement requires the output to be the minimum value followed by the maximum value.

In the annotated program, the print statement is `print(max(a, b), min(a, b))`, which prints the maximum value first, followed by the minimum value. This is opposite of what the problem statement requires.

Therefore, the program is incorrect based on the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
