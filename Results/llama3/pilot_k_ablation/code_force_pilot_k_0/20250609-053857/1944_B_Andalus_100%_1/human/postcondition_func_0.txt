This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function processes each test case by splitting the integers into two lists, sorting them, and then printing out pairs of identical integers from the lists, maximizing the number of pairs equal to k. If there are remaining integers that are not part of any pair, they are printed separately. This process is repeated for each test case, resulting in a series of pairs of integers and potentially some single integers.
