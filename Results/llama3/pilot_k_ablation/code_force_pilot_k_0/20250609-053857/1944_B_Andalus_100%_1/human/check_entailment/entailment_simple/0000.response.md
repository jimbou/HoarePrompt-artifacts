Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  It splits the input list into two halves, `lft` and `rgt`, which represent the left and right halves of the input list.
3.  It initializes three lists: `ldb` and `rdb` to store the duplicate elements from the left and right halves, respectively, and `sng` to store the single elements from the left half.
4.  It sorts the left and right halves of the input list.
5.  It iterates through the left half and checks for duplicate elements. If an element is a duplicate, it adds it to `ldb`. If an element is not a duplicate, it adds it to `sng`.
6.  It iterates through the right half and checks for duplicate elements. If an element is a duplicate, it adds it to `rdb`.
7.  It prints the duplicate elements from `ldb` and `rdb` in pairs, followed by the single elements from `sng`. This ensures that the XOR of the elements in the left and right halves is equal.
8.  It repeats this process for each test case in the input.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
