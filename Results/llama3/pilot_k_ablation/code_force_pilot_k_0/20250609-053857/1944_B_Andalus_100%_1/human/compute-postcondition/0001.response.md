Output State: **The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a series of pairs of integers, where each pair contains two identical integers. The number of pairs is equal to k, and the integers in each pair are selected from the input list in a way that maximizes the number of pairs. The remaining integers that are not part of any pair are printed separately. This process is repeated for each test case in the input.**
