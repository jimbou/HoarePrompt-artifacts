The function reads an integer t from standard input, followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B. It then prints t lines to standard output, where each line is either 'A' or 'B', depending on whether the count of 'A's is greater than or less than the count of 'B's in the corresponding input string. The function does not return any value, and it leaves the standard input empty.
