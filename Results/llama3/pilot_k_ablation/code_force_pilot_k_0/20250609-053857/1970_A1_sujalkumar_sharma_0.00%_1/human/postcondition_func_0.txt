This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input, sorts the characters based on the balance of open and close parentheses and their indices, and returns a new string formed by concatenating the sorted characters. The input string remains unchanged, and the returned string has the same length as the input string. The function effectively rearranges the parentheses in the input string while maintaining the balance.
