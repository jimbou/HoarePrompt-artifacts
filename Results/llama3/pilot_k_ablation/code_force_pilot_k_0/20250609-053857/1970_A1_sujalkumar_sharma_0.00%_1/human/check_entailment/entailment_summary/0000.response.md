Reasoning:

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly calculates the balance of the input parentheses sequence by iterating through each character and updating the balance accordingly.
2.  It stores the balance, position, and character in a list of tuples, which is then sorted based on the balance and position.
3.  The sorting key function `lambda x: (x[0], -x[1])` correctly sorts the tuples first by the balance in ascending order and then by the position in descending order, which is in line with the problem description.
4.  Finally, the program constructs the balanced shuffle by joining the characters in the sorted order, which is the desired output.

The execution summary also confirms that the program works as expected, rearranging the parentheses while maintaining the balance.

Correctness: **True**
