The `print` statement will print the absolute difference between the length of the string `s` (denoted by `n`) and twice the number of '-' characters in the string `s` (denoted by `neg`). However, if the length of the string `s` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, it will print the length of the string `s`.

Output: **the absolute difference between the length of the string s and twice the number of '-' characters in the string s, or the length of the string s if the length is equal to the number of '-' characters**
