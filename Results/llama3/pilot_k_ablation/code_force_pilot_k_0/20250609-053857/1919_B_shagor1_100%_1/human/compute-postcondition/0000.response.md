Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-", neg is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive. The second line assigns the string value of the input to `s`. Since `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-", `s` becomes a string of length `n` consisting of characters "+" and "-". The third line assigns the value 0 to `neg`. Since `neg` is 0, `neg` becomes 0. No other variables are affected.
