Functionality: **This function reads a test case from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a string s of length n containing "+" and "-" characters. It then calculates and prints the absolute difference between the length of the string s and twice the number of '-' characters in the string s. If the length of the string s is equal to the number of '-' characters, it prints the length of the string s instead.**
