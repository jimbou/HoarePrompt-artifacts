Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string s and then prints the absolute difference between the length of the string s and twice the number of '-' characters. If the length of the string s is equal to the number of '-' characters, it prints the length of the string s.

This solution is correct because it effectively calculates the minimum possible penalty. The key insight is that the optimal way to split the array is to group all the '+' characters together and all the '-' characters together. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so grouping all the '+' characters together will result in a subarray with a sum of 1 and a length equal to the number of '+' characters, and similarly for the '-' characters.

The absolute difference between the length of the string s and twice the number of '-' characters is equal to the absolute value of the sum of the subarray of '+' characters minus the absolute value of the sum of the subarray of '-' characters. This is because the sum of the subarray of '+' characters is equal to the number of '+' characters, and the sum of the subarray of '-' characters is equal to the negative of the number of '-' characters.

If the length of the string s is equal to the number of '-' characters, then the string s consists only of '-' characters, and the minimum possible penalty is equal to the length of the string s.

Therefore, the given program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
