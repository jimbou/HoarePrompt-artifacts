Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array `a` into non-empty subarrays `b_1, b_2, ..., b_k` such that the sum of the penalties of these subarrays is minimized.

The penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. In other words, for some array `c` of length `m`, its penalty is calculated as `p(c) = |c_1 + c_2 + ... + c_m| * m`.

The given program defines a function `func_1()` that takes no arguments and performs the following operations:

1. It reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the length of the string `s`.
2. It reads a string `s` from the input, which consists of characters '+' and '-'.
3. It initializes a variable `neg` to 0, which will be used to count the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
4. It iterates over each character `i` in the string `s`. If `i` is '-', it increments the `neg` variable by 1.
5. It prints the absolute value of the difference between `n` and `2 * neg` if `n` is not equal to `neg`, otherwise it prints `n`.

The reasoning behind this program is as follows:

* The number of '+' characters in the string `s` is `n - neg`, and the number of '-' characters is `neg`.
* The sum of the array `a` is `n - 2 * neg`, because each '+' character contributes 1 to the sum, and each '-' character contributes -1.
* The penalty of the array `a` is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, which is `|n - 2 * neg| * n`.
* However, if `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that the array `a` has an equal number of '+' and '-' characters, and therefore its sum is 0. In this case, the penalty is simply `n`.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to calculate the minimum possible penalty. It only needs to iterate over the string `s` once to count the number of '-' characters, and then it can calculate the penalty using a single expression.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
