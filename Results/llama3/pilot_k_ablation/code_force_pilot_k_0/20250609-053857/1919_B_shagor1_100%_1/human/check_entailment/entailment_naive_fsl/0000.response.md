Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the minimum possible penalty according to the problem description. The key insight is that the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length. The program correctly calculates the sum of the array by counting the number of '-' characters (which represent -1) and subtracting twice that number from the total length of the array (which represents the number of '+' characters, each contributing 1 to the sum).

The program then prints the absolute value of this sum, which represents the minimum possible penalty. The only case where the penalty is not simply the absolute value of the sum is when the sum is 0, in which case the penalty is the length of the array (because the array can be split into subarrays of length 1, each with a penalty of 1). The program correctly handles this case by printing the length of the array when the sum is 0.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
