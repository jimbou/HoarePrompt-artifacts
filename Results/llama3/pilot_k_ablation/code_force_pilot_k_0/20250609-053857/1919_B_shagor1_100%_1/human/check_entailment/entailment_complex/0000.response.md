Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the number of '-' characters in the string s and then prints the absolute difference between the length of the string s and twice the number of '-' characters. If the length of the string s is equal to the number of '-' characters, it prints the length of the string s instead.

This approach is correct because the minimum possible penalty can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays of '+' and '-' characters separately. The penalty for a subarray of '+' characters is equal to its length, and the penalty for a subarray of '-' characters is also equal to its length. Therefore, the total penalty is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters, which is equivalent to the absolute difference between the length of the string s and twice the number of '-' characters.

Correctness: **True**
