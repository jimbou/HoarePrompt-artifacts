Output State: **The output state will be a series of pairs of arrays, where each pair represents the result of a test case. The first array in each pair contains the elements from the first half of the input array that are either duplicates or have been added from the left-over list, and the second array contains the elements from the second half of the input array that are duplicates. The arrays are sorted in ascending order. The number of pairs is equal to the number of test cases (t).**
