Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly solves the problem by first sorting the two halves of the array and then constructing the two subsets `l` and `r` by selecting pairs of equal elements from the sorted halves. If there are remaining elements that are not paired, they are added to both `l` and `r` to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` is equal.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where `k` is equal to `n/2`, where `n` is the length of the array. In this case, the program selects all pairs of equal elements from the sorted halves and adds any remaining elements to both `l` and `r`.

The program also handles the case where `k` is less than `n/2`, where it selects `2k` pairs of equal elements from the sorted halves and adds any remaining elements to both `l` and `r`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem and handles all possible cases correctly.
