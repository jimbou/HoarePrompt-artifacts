Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers.
2.  It separates the input integers into two halves, `b` and `c`, and sorts each half in ascending order.
3.  The program identifies duplicates in each half by iterating through the sorted lists. For the first half, it prioritizes duplicates and adds them to the result array `ans1`. If there are remaining elements needed to reach the required length `k`, it adds non-duplicate elements from the first half to `ans1`.
4.  For the second half, it only considers duplicates and adds them to the result array `ans2`.
5.  The program prints the two result arrays, `ans1` and `ans2`, in ascending order for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly constructs the two arrays `l` and `r` as per the problem's requirements. The use of sorting and iterating through the lists to identify duplicates is efficient and effective.

Correctness: **True**
