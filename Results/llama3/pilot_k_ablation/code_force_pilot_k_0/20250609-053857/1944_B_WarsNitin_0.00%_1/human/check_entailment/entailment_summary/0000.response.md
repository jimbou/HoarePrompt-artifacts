Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two integers `n` and `k`, and a list of `2n` integers.
2.  It separates the list of integers into two halves, `b` and `c`, and sorts each half in ascending order.
3.  The program then constructs two arrays, `ans1` and `ans2`, by prioritizing duplicates in each half. If there are remaining elements to be added to reach the required length of `2k`, it adds non-duplicate elements from the first half to `ans1` and the corresponding elements from the second half to `ans2`.
4.  Finally, the program prints the two arrays, `ans1` and `ans2`, in ascending order for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, producing the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
