This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, separating them into two halves, sorting each half, and identifying duplicates. It constructs two arrays, one from the first half and one from the second half, by prioritizing duplicates and then adding non-duplicate elements from the first half if necessary. The function prints these two arrays in ascending order for each test case. The output consists of a series of pairs of arrays, where each pair represents the result of a test case.
