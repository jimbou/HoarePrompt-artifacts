stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m, and k. The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n. The third line contains m space-separated integers d_1, d_2, d_3, ..., d_m. The fourth line contains k space-separated integers f_1, f_2, f_3, ..., f_k.
