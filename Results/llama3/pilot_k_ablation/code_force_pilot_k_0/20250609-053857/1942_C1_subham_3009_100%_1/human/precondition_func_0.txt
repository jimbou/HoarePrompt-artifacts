stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer less than or equal to n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The number of test cases is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4.
