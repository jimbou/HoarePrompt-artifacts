Output State: **The program has finished executing all test cases and has printed the maximum number of pairs of adjacent integers that can be formed from the given array for each test case. The value of t is 0, and the values of n, x, y, arr, and ans have been updated for each test case.**

In this output state, the program has completed all the iterations of the loop and has processed all the test cases. The value of t has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been executed. The values of n, x, y, arr, and ans have been updated for each test case, and the program has printed the maximum number of pairs of adjacent integers that can be formed from the given array for each test case. The program is now in a state where it has finished executing all test cases and has produced the desired output.
