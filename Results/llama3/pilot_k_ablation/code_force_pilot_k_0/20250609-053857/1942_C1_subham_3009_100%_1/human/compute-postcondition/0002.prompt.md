Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program is running as the main module, `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer less than or equal to n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The number of test cases is one less than before.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    arr.sort()
    arr.append(n + arr[0])
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
