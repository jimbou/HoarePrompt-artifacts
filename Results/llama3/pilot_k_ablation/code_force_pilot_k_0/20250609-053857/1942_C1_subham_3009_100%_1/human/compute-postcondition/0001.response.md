Output State: **The program is running as the main module, `t` is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, x, and y, where n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, x is a positive integer less than or equal to n and 2 * 10^5, and y is 0. The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n. The number of test cases is one less than before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The program is still running as the main module. The variable `t` has been assigned a value, which is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^4. The number of test cases in the stdin has decreased by one. The remaining test cases still consist of two lines each, with the first line containing three integers (n, x, and y) and the second line containing x distinct integers from 1 to n.
