Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly checks if the letters and digits in each password are sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the original string of letters and digits with their sorted versions.
2.  The program also checks if there are any digits that come after a letter in the password. It does this by finding the index of the last letter and the first digit in the password and checking if the last letter appears before the first digit.
3.  The program handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits correctly. In these cases, the program will not enter the conditional block that checks for the relative positions of letters and digits.
4.  The program returns 'YES' for valid passwords and 'NO' for invalid ones, as required by the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
