Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter. The current implementation checks if the last letter appears after the first digit in the password, which is not sufficient. A counterexample is the password "a1b2", where the program incorrectly returns "YES". 

The correct implementation should check if any digit appears after any letter in the password. This can be done by iterating through the password and checking if a digit appears after a letter. If such a case is found, the program should return "NO". 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        has_letter = False
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                has_letter = True
            elif ch.isdigit() and has_letter:
                results.append('NO')
                break
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results
```

This corrected version of the program correctly implements the condition that there should be no digit that comes after a letter.
