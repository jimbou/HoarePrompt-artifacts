Reasoning:

1. The problem requires checking if a given password meets certain conditions: it should consist only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, there should be no digit that comes after a letter, all digits should be sorted in non-decreasing order, and all letters should be sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes the number of test cases `t` and a list of test cases `test_cases` as input. Each test case is a tuple containing the length of the password `n` and the password itself.

3. The function iterates over each test case, separates the letters and digits from the password, and checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.

4. If the letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit in the password. If there is such a digit, it appends 'NO' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

5. The function returns the list of results, which are then printed.

6. The program correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
