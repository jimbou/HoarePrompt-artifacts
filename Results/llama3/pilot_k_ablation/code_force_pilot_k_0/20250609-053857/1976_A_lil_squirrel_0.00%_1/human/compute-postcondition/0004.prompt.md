You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists where each sublist contains two elements: a positive integer n and a string of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        
        digits = ''
        
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        
        if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(digits
            [0]):
            results.append('NO')
        else:
            results.append('YES')
        
    #State: Output State: The `results` list contains a string 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case in `test_cases`, indicating whether the password is valid or not based on the given conditions. The `t` variable remains unchanged, and the `test_cases` list also remains unchanged.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of strings 'results' where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the password is valid or not for each test case in 'test_cases'. The number of strings in 'results' is equal to the number of test cases in 'test_cases'. The 't' variable and 'test_cases' list remain unchanged.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of strings 'results' where each string is either 'YES' or 'NO', indicating whether the password is valid or not for each test case in 'test_cases'. The number of strings in 'results' is equal to the number of test cases in 'test_cases'. The 't' variable and 'test_cases' list remain unchanged.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
