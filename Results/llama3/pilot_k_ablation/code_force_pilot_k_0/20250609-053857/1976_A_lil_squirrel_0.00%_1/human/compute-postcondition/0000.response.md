Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists where each sublist contains two elements: a positive integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list**.

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `results` which is an empty list. The values of the other variables, `t` and `test_cases`, remain unchanged. The list `test_cases` still contains sublists with two elements each: a positive integer `n` and a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits.
