Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the required functionality to find two indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized, where ⊕ denotes the bitwise XOR operation. The program uses a series of queries to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the secret sequence p. It first finds the maximum element in the sequence, then finds the maximum element that is not equal to the maximum element, and finally finds the maximum element among the remaining elements. The program uses at most 3n queries, which is within the allowed limit.

Correctness: **True**
