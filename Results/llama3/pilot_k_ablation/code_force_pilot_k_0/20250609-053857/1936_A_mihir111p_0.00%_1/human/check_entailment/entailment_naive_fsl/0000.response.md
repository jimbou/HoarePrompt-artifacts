Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly find the pair of indices i and j such that p_i ⊕ p_j is maximized. The issue lies in the way the program handles the case when there are multiple indices with the maximum value.

In the second part of the program, it tries to find the maximum value among the indices that have the same maximum value as `ans1`. However, it only checks if the current index `i` is greater than `mx` and updates `mx` and `v` accordingly. This means that if there are multiple indices with the same maximum value, the program will only consider the first one it encounters and ignore the rest.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4` and the permutation is `p = [0, 3, 1, 2]`. The program will correctly find `ans1 = 1` as the index with the maximum value. However, when it tries to find the maximum value among the indices that have the same maximum value as `ans1`, it will only consider `i = 2` and ignore `i = 3`, which also has the same maximum value. As a result, the program will output `! 2 1`, which is incorrect because `p_2 ⊕ p_1 = 2` is not the maximum possible value.

To fix this issue, the program should keep track of all indices that have the same maximum value as `ans1` and then find the pair of indices that maximizes `p_i ⊕ p_j` among these indices.
