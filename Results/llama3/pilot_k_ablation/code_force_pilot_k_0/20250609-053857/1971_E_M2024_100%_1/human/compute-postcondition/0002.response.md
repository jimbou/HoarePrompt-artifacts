Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four inputs: n, k, q, a_i, b_i, and d. It calculates the differences between consecutive elements in a_i and b_i, and then uses these differences to calculate the value of m for each query in d. The function prints the calculated values of m for each query in each test case.**
