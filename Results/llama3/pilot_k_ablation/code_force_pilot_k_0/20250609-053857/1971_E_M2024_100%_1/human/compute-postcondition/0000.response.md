Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four inputs: first three space-separated integers n, k, and q, and then k space-separated integers a_i, and then k space-separated integers b_i, and finally q space-separated integers d. n and k are positive integers, q is a non-negative integer, a_i and b_i are positive integers, and d are non-negative integers.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with the same structure as before: four inputs for each test case. The values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a_i`, `b_i`, and `d` are still the same as in the initial state, but now `t` has been assigned a value.
