Output State: **The output state is a series of q integers, each representing the value of m, which is calculated based on the input values of n, k, q, a, b, and d. The values of n, k, and q are not changed, and the values of a, b, and d are used to calculate the values of ad, bd, and v, which are then used to calculate the values of m. The output state is a series of q integers, each representing the value of m, which is calculated based on the input values of n, k, q, a, b, and d.**
