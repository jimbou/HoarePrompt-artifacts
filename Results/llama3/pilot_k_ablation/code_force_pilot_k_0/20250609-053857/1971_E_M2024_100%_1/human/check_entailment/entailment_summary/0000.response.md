Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly reads the input, calculates the differences between consecutive elements in the arrays `a` and `b`, and uses these differences to calculate the time it takes for the car to reach each query point `d`. The program also correctly handles the case where the query point `d` is equal to one of the points in array `a`.

The program uses the `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module to find the index `s` such that `a[s]` is the largest element in `a` that is less than or equal to `d`. This is correct because the problem states that the car travels at a constant speed between any two adjacent signs, so the time it takes to reach `d` can be calculated by adding the time it takes to reach `a[s]` and the time it takes to travel from `a[s]` to `d` at the constant speed.

The program also correctly calculates the time it takes to travel from `a[s]` to `d` by dividing the distance `d - a[s-1]` by the speed `ad[s] / bd[s]`, which is the speed at which the car travels between `a[s-1]` and `a[s]`.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
