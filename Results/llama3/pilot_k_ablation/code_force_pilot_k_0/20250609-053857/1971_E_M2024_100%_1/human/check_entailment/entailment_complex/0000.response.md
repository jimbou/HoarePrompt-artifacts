Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `k`, and `q`, which represent the final destination, the number of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries respectively.

3. It then reads the `k` integers `a_i` and `b_i`, which represent the points on the number line and the time taken to reach those points respectively.

4. The program calculates the differences between consecutive elements in `a_i` and `b_i` and stores them in `ad` and `bd` respectively.

5. It then calculates the speed of the car between each pair of consecutive points and stores them in `v`.

6. For each query `d`, the program uses binary search to find the segment in which `d` lies. If `d` is equal to one of the points `a_i`, it directly prints the corresponding time `b_i`.

7. If `d` is not equal to any of the points `a_i`, it calculates the time taken to reach `d` by adding the time taken to reach the previous point and the time taken to cover the remaining distance at the current speed.

8. Finally, the program prints the calculated time for each query.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all the edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
