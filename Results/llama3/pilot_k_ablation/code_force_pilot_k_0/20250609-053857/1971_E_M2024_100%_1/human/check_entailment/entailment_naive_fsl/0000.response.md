Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for the car to reach a certain point based on the given distances and times. It uses binary search to find the appropriate segment of the journey and then calculates the time based on the speed of that segment.

The program handles all the edge cases correctly, including when the query point is at the start or end of a segment, and when the query point is exactly at a known distance.

The use of bisect_left from the bisect module is also correct, as it finds the insertion point for the query point in the list of known distances, which is the correct way to determine which segment the query point belongs to.

The calculation of the time is also correct, as it takes into account the time already traveled to the start of the segment and the time it takes to travel the remaining distance at the speed of the segment.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles all the edge cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
