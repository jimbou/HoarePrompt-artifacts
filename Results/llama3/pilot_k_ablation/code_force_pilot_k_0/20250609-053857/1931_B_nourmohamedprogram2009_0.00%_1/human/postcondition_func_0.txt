This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It checks if the integers in each test case are in non-decreasing order after sorting and prints 'YES' if they are, and 'NO' otherwise. The function does not modify the input values or store any results, only printing the outcome of each test case to the console.
