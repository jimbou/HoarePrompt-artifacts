Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It checks if the integers in each test case are in non-decreasing order after sorting and prints 'YES' if they are, and 'NO' otherwise.

However, the problem statement requires that the amount of water in all containers can be made the same using the operation of pouring water from the i-th container to the j-th container, where i must be less than j. This means that the program should check if the prefix sum of the array is less than or equal to the average of the array at each index.

The given program only checks if the array is non-decreasing after sorting, which is not sufficient to solve the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
