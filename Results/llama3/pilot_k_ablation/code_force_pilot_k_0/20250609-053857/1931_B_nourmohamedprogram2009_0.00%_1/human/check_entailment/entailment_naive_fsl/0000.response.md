Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the array and then checks if all elements are in non-decreasing order. However, this approach does not take into account the actual requirement of the problem, which is to check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will output "YES" because the array is already sorted, but it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in all containers and then check if it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount. This can be done by checking if the sum of the differences between each container's amount and the average is non-negative. If it is, then it is possible to redistribute the water, otherwise, it is not.

Here is a correct implementation:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
        avg = sum(arr) // n
        diff_sum = sum(max(0, avg - x) for x in arr)
        if diff_sum <= sum(max(0, x - avg) for x in arr):
            print('YES')
        else:
            print('NO')
```

This program calculates the average amount of water in all containers and then checks if it is possible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount. If it is possible, it outputs "YES", otherwise, it outputs "NO".
