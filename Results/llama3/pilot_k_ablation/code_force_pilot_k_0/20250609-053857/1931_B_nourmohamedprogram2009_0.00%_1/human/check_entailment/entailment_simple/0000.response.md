Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program simply checks if the input array is non-decreasing, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

The program's logic is flawed because it does not consider the actual amounts of water in the containers or the divisibility of the sum of the amounts by the number of containers. It only checks if the array is sorted in ascending order, which is not a necessary or sufficient condition for the problem.

For example, consider the input [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]. The program will output 'NO' because the array is not non-decreasing. However, it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from the second container to the third and fourth containers, as shown in the problem statement's note.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct solution would require a more sophisticated approach that takes into account the actual amounts of water and the divisibility of the sum by the number of containers.

Correctness: **False**
