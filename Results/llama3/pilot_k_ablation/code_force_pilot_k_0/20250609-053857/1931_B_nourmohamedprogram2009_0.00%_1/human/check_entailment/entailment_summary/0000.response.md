Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program only checks if the input array is in non-decreasing order after sorting, which is not a sufficient condition to solve the problem.

The program does not take into account the actual values of the input array or the number of containers. It simply checks if the sorted array is in non-decreasing order, which is always true for a sorted array. This means that the program will always print 'YES', regardless of the input values.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should calculate the average amount of water in all containers and then check if it is possible to make the amount of water in each container equal to the average by pouring water from one container to another. This requires a more complex algorithm that takes into account the actual values of the input array and the number of containers.

Correctness: **False**
