Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the array of water amounts and then checking if each element is less than or equal to the next one. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem statement allows pouring water from one container to another as long as the source container has a lower index than the destination container. This means that the program should check if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from containers with lower indices to containers with higher indices.

The program's current approach does not take this into account. It simply checks if the sorted array is non-decreasing, which is not sufficient to determine if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.

For example, consider the input [3, 3, 4, 4]. The program will sort this array to [3, 3, 4, 4] and then check if each element is less than or equal to the next one. Since this condition is true, the program will output "YES". However, it's not possible to make all containers have the same amount of water by pouring water from containers with lower indices to containers with higher indices.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
