#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        m, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))[:m]
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b.sort()
        
        result = []
        
        n = n // 2
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if len(a) == len(b):
                break
            b.remove(b[n - 1])
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
            a.remove(max(a))
            b.remove(min(b))
        
        print(sum(result))
        
    #State: The loop will execute n times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read two lines of input, the first line containing an integer m, and the second line containing m integers. It will then sort the integers in ascending order, remove the middle element (if the length of the list is odd), and calculate the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum element of the first list and the minimum element of the second list, and the maximum element of the first list and the minimum element of the second list after removing the maximum element from the first list and the minimum element from the second list. The result will be printed for each test case. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will exit.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of integers. It processes each test case by sorting the second line of integers, removing the middle element if the length is odd, and then iteratively calculates the sum of absolute differences between the maximum element of the first line and the minimum element of the sorted second line, updating the lines by removing the maximum and minimum elements respectively. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.
