Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it constructs the array `c_i` to maximize the total difference `D`. The program removes the largest element from `a` and the smallest element from `b` in each iteration, which is not the optimal strategy.

A counterexample is when `a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The program will remove the largest element from `a` (5) and the smallest element from `b` (1) in the first iteration, resulting in `a = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `b = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. However, the optimal strategy would be to remove the smallest element from `a` (1) and the largest element from `b` (10) in the first iteration, resulting in `a = [2, 3, 4, 5]` and `b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]`. This would result in a larger total difference `D`.

The correct approach would be to sort both arrays `a` and `b` and then iterate through them, removing the smallest element from `a` and the largest element from `b` in each iteration, or vice versa, depending on which one results in a larger difference.
