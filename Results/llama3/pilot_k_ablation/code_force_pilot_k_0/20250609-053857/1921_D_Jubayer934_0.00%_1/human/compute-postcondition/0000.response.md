Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5 from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but each test case now has two lines instead of three. The first line of each test case contains an integer `m` between 1 and 2⋅10^5, and the second line contains `m` integers `b_i` between 1 and 10^9.
