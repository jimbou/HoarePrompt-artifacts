Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines of integers. It processes each test case by sorting the second line of integers, removing the middle element if the length is odd, and then iteratively calculates the sum of absolute differences between the maximum element of the first line and the minimum element of the sorted second line, updating the lines by removing the maximum and minimum elements respectively. The function prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.**
