Output State: **The loop will execute n times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read two lines of input, the first line containing an integer m, and the second line containing m integers. It will then sort the integers in ascending order, remove the middle element (if the length of the list is odd), and calculate the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum element of the first list and the minimum element of the second list, and the maximum element of the first list and the minimum element of the second list after removing the maximum element from the first list and the minimum element from the second list. The result will be printed for each test case. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will exit.**
