You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation details—focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ m ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        m, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))[:m]
        
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        
        b.sort()
        
        result = []
        
        n = n // 2
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            if len(a) == len(b):
                break
            b.remove(b[n - 1])
        
        for i in range(len(a)):
            result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
            a.remove(max(a))
            b.remove(min(b))
        
        print(sum(result))
        
    #State: The loop will execute n times, each time processing a test case. For each test case, it will read two lines of input, the first line containing an integer m, and the second line containing m integers. It will then sort the integers in ascending order, remove the middle element (if the length of the list is odd), and calculate the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum element of the first list and the minimum element of the second list, and the maximum element of the first list and the minimum element of the second list after removing the maximum element from the first list and the minimum element from the second list. The result will be printed for each test case. After all iterations, the loop will terminate, and the program will exit.

```

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
