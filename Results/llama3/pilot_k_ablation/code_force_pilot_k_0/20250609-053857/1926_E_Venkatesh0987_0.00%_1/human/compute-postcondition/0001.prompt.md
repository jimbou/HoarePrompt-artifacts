You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t+1 inputs: the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), and each of the next t inputs is a pair of space-separated integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = 0
        
        i = 0
        
        d = n
        
        h = n
        
        p = 1
        
        g = 0
        
        if k > (n + 1) // 2:
            while s < k and d > 0:
                s += (d + 1) // 2
                d -= (d + 1) // 2
                i += 1
            while p <= i - 1:
                g += (h + 1) // 2
                h -= (h + 1) // 2
                p += 1
            f = k - g
            y = 2 ** (i - 1) * f
            print(y)
        else:
            print(2 * k - 1)
        
    #State: The output state will be a list of t integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input pair (n, k). The calculation is based on the conditions and formulas specified in the loop body. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, the calculation involves a series of while loops and bit manipulation, resulting in a value y. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the calculation simply results in 2 * k - 1. The output state will contain the results of these calculations for each input pair.

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
