Output State: **The output state will be a list of t integers, each representing the result of the calculation for the corresponding input pair (n, k). The calculation is based on the conditions and formulas specified in the loop body. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, the calculation involves a series of while loops and bit manipulation, resulting in a value y. If k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, the calculation simply results in 2 * k - 1. The output state will contain the results of these calculations for each input pair.**
