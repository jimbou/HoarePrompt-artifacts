Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first checks if `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. If this condition is true, it means that the `k`-th card is not among the first half of the cards (i.e., the odd-numbered cards). In this case, the program enters a loop that calculates the number of cards that have been laid down in each iteration of the process (i.e., the number of cards that are twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on).

2. The program uses two while loops to calculate the number of cards that have been laid down in each iteration. The first while loop calculates the number of cards that have been laid down in each iteration, and the second while loop calculates the total number of cards that have been laid down up to the current iteration.

3. Once the program has calculated the total number of cards that have been laid down up to the current iteration, it calculates the `k`-th card by subtracting the total number of cards laid down from `k` and multiplying the result by `2` raised to the power of the current iteration minus one.

4. If `k` is not greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, the program simply calculates the `k`-th card as `2 * k - 1`, which is the correct formula for the first half of the cards (i.e., the odd-numbered cards).

5. The program repeats this process for each input pair `(n, k)` and prints the corresponding result.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for each input pair.

Correctness: **True**
