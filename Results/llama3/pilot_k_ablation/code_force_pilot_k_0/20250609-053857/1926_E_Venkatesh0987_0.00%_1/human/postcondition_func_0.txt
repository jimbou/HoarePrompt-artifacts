Calculates and prints the result of a mathematical operation for each input pair (n, k), where the operation depends on whether k is greater than (n + 1) // 2. If true, the result is calculated through a series of while loops and bit manipulation, otherwise, the result is simply 2 * k - 1. The function processes multiple input pairs and prints the corresponding results.
