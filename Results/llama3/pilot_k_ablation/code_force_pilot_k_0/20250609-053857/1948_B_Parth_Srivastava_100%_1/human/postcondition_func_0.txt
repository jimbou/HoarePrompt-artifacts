This function processes a list of integers, splitting numbers greater than 10 into two separate elements (tens and ones digits) if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit, and checks if the resulting list is sorted. It returns 1 if the list is sorted and 0 otherwise, while keeping track of the total number of elements in the list.
