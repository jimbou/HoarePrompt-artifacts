Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if a list of integers can be made sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting numbers greater than 10 into two separate elements (tens and ones digits) if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of elements in the list and the list itself. It then processes the list by splitting numbers greater than 10 into two separate elements if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit. It keeps track of the total number of elements in the list and checks if the resulting list is sorted. If the list is sorted, it appends 1 to the list b, otherwise, it appends 0.

The program then prints 'YES' if the list b contains 1 for a test case, otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the list contains only one element or when the list is already sorted.

Correctness: **True**
