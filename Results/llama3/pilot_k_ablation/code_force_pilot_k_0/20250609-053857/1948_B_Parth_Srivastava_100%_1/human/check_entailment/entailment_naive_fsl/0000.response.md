Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input array is [12, 3, 45, 67] and we apply the operation to the first element, the array becomes [1, 2, 3, 45, 67]. However, the program does not correctly handle this case. It checks if the first digit (1) is less than or equal to the second digit (2), which is true, but it does not check if the second digit (2) is less than or equal to the third digit (3), which is also true. Therefore, the program incorrectly concludes that the array is not sorted.

Another issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the input array is already sorted. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4], the program will incorrectly conclude that the array is not sorted because it does not check if the array is already sorted before applying the operation.

Overall, the program does not correctly implement the problem description and therefore has a correctness of **False**.
