Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and stores it in the list `a`.
2. It then iterates over the list `a` and checks if each element is greater than 10. If it is, it splits the element into two separate elements (tens and ones digits) if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit.
3. The program then creates a sorted version of the list `c` (which contains the split elements) and checks if the original list `c` is equal to the sorted list `d`. If it is, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that the list can be sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it appends 0 to the list `b`.
4. Finally, the program prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in the list `b` is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
