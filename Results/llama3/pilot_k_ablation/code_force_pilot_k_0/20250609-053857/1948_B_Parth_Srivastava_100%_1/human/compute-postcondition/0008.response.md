Postcondition: ***The list c contains all elements from list a, with elements greater than 10 split into two separate elements (tens and ones digits) if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit, and the counter n is equal to the total number of elements in list c. The value of k remains unchanged. The list d is a sorted version of list c. If the list c is equal to the list d, then the list b contains an additional element, which is 1. If the list c and the list d are not equal, then the list b contains an additional element, which is 0.***
