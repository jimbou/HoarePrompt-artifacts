Postcondition: ***The list c contains all elements from list a, with elements greater than 10 split into two separate elements (tens and ones digits) if the tens digit is less than or equal to the ones digit, and the counter n is equal to the total number of elements in list c. The value of k remains unchanged. The list d is a sorted version of list c. The current value of c is equal to the current value of d.***
