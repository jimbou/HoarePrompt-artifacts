Output State: **ans is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in s, i is n**

After the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will be that 'ans' will hold the count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in the string 's'. The variable 'i' will be equal to 'n', which is the length of the string 's', indicating that the loop has traversed the entire string.
