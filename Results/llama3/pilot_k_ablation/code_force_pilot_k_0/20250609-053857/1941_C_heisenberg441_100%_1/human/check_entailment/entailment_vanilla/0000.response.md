Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The function uses a while loop to iterate over the characters in the string. It checks for the presence of the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" at the current position `i` in the string. If any of these substrings are found, it increments the count `ans` by 1 and moves the position `i` to the end of the substring. If none of these substrings are found, it simply moves the position `i` to the next character.

The function returns the count `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
