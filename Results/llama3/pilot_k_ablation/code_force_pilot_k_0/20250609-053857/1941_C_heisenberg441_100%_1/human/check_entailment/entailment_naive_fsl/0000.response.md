Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It checks for the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" and increments the count whenever it finds any of these substrings. The program then returns the count, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. It checks for the longest substring "mapie" first, then for "map" and "pie". This ensures that it always finds the minimum number of characters to delete. For example, if the string contains "mapie", it will delete 1 character instead of deleting 2 characters for "map" and "pie" separately.

The program also handles the case where the string does not contain any of the substrings "mapie", "map", or "pie". In this case, it will return 0, which is correct because the string is already beautiful.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
