Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program checks for non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in the string and increments the count accordingly. The count represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
