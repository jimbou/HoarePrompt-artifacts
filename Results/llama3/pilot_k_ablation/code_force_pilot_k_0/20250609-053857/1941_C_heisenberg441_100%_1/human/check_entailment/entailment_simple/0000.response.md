Reasoning: The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It checks for non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie' in the string and increments the count accordingly. The program also handles the case where the string is already beautiful by returning 0.

Correctness: **True**
