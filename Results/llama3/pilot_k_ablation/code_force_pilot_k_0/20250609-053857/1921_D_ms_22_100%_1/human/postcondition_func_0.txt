This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then sorts the integers a_i and b_i, and iteratively calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the smallest and largest elements of the two sorted lists, updating the indices of the smallest and largest elements accordingly. The function prints the final sum of absolute differences for each test case.
