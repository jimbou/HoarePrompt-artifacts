Output State: **t = 0, ans = 0, a1 = 0, a2 = -1, b1 = 0, b2 = -1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is set to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `ans` is reset to 0, as it is used to store the result of each test case. The indices `a1` and `a2` are set to 0 and -1, respectively, indicating that the arrays `a` and `b` have been fully processed. Similarly, the indices `b1` and `b2` are set to 0 and -1, respectively.
