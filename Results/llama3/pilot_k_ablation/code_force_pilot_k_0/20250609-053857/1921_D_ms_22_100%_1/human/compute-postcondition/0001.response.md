The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, the first line of the first test case is read, which contains two integers `n` and `m`. The value of `t` is equal to the first integer `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer `m` (1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5), the second line contains `m` integers `b_i` (1 <= b_i <= 10^9), and the rest of the test cases remain unchanged.**
