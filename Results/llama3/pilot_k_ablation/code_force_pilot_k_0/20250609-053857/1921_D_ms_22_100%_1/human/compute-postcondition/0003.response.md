Postcondition: ***stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines: the first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5), the second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), and the third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). After execution, t = 0, ans = 0, a1 = 0, a2 = -1, b1 = 0, b2 = -1.***
