Given a Python loop and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains one integer `m` (1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5), the second line contains `m` integers `b_i` (1 <= b_i <= 10^9), and the rest of the test cases remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a1 = 0
    a2 = n - 1
    b1 = 0
    b2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    b.sort()
    a.sort()
    while a1 <= a2:
        dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
        dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
        dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
        dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
        if dif1 > dif2:
            if dif3 > dif4:
                if dif3 > dif1:
                    ans += dif3
                    a2 -= 1
                    b1 += 1
                else:
                    ans += dif1
                    a1 += 1
                    b1 += 1
            elif dif4 > dif1:
                ans += dif4
                a2 -= 1
                b2 -= 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif2:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif2
                a1 += 1
                b2 -= 1
        elif dif4 > dif2:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    print(ans)



What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
