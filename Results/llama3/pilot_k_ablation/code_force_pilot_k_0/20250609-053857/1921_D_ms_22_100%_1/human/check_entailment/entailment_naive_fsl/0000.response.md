Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by Vasya's array from Petya's array.

The program first sorts both arrays, then it uses two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of each array. It calculates the absolute difference between the current elements of the two arrays and chooses the maximum difference. It then moves the pointers accordingly to maximize the total difference.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the cases where the arrays have different lengths, and where the elements of the arrays are equal. It also handles the case where the maximum difference is obtained by choosing the smallest element from one array and the largest element from the other array.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct.
