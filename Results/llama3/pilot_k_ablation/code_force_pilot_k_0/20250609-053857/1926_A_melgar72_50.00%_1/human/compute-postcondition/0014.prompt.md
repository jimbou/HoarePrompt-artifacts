You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
        
    #State: Output State: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, countA is 3, countB is 2, and a list representation of userString exists in memory.
    if (countA > countB) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        if (countB > countA) :
            print('B')
            #This is printed: B
        else :
            pass
        #State: *userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, countA is 3, countB is 2, and a list representation of userString exists in memory. If countB is greater than countA, 'B' is printed. Otherwise, countA is greater than or equal to countB.
    #State: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, countA is 3, countB is 2, and a list representation of userString exists in memory. If countA is higher than countB, the letter 'A' is printed. If countB is higher than countA, the letter 'B' is printed. Otherwise, countA is greater than or equal to countB.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, countA is 3, countB is 2, and a list representation of userString exists in memory. The current value of countA is higher than the current value of countB, and the letter 'A' is being printed

Case_2: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, countA is 3, countB is 2, and a list representation of userString exists in memory. The current value of countA is less than or equal to countB. The current value of countB is greater than countA, and 'B' is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
