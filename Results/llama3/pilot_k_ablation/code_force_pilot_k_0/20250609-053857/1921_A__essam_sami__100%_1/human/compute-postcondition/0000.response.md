The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i` and `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers `x_i` and `y_i` (-1000 <= `x_i`, `y_i` <= 1000), representing the coordinates of the corners of a square.**
