Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h) where (a, b) and (c, d) are diagonally opposite corners of the square, and (e, f) and (g, h) are the other two corners. 

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) and the distance between (1, 2) and (4, 2), and then print the smaller one, which is not the correct area of the square.

The correct approach would be to find the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates, and then calculate the area of the square as the square of the difference between the maximum and minimum x or y coordinates.
