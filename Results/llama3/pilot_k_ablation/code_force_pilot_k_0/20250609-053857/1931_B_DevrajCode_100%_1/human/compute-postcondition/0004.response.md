Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, and `container` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `container` which is initialized to 0. The remainder of the division of `total_water` by `n` is still 0.
