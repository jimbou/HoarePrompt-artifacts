Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, total_water is the sum of a, and target is the integer division of total_water by n.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `total_water` is assigned the sum of all elements in list `a`, which is a specific value since `a` contains a list of n non-negative integers. The variable `target` is assigned the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, which is also a specific value since `total_water` is divisible by `n` according to the precondition.
