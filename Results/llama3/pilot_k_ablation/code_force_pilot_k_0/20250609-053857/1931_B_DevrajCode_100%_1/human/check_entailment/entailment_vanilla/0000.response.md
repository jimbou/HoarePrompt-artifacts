Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first calculates the total amount of water in all containers using the `sum()` function.

2. It then calculates the target amount of water each container should have by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers (`n`). This is done using integer division (`//`), which ensures that the result is an integer.

3. The program checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the function immediately returns `'NO'`, because it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

4. The program then initializes a variable `container` to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the cumulative difference between the amount of water in each container and the target amount.

5. The program iterates over the amount of water in each container. For each container, it adds the difference between the amount of water in the container and the target amount to the `container` variable.

6. If the `container` variable becomes negative at any point, the function immediately returns `'NO'`. This is because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to make the amount of water in the current container equal to the target amount.

7. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning `'NO'`, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. In this case, the function returns `'YES'`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
