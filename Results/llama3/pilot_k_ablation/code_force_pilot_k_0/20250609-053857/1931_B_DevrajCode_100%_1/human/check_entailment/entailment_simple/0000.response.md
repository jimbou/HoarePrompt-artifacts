Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water in each container. It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If not, it returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly in this case.

2. The program then iterates over the list of water amounts in the containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total `container`.

3. If at any point the running total `container` becomes negative, the program returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

4. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to distribute the water evenly, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
