Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water in each container. It then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it is not, the program returns 'NO' because it is impossible to distribute the water evenly.

The program then iterates over the list of water levels in the containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current water level and the target water level. If this difference is negative, it means that the current container has less water than the target amount, and the program returns 'NO' because it is impossible to distribute the water evenly.

If the program iterates over the entire list of containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, and the program returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
