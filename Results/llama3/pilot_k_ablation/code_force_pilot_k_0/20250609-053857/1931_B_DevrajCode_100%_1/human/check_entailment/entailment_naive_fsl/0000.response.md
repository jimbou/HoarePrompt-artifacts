Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The key insight is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, which means that the target amount of water in each container is an integer.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water in each container. It then iterates over the containers, keeping track of the difference between the current container's water level and the target level. If at any point this difference becomes negative, it means that the current container does not have enough water to reach the target level, and the program returns 'NO'.

If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, and it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the number of containers is 1, and the case where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target amount. It also correctly handles cases where the amount of water in some containers is greater than the target amount, and cases where the amount of water in some containers is less than the target amount.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
