Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The program iterates over each test case, reads the values of n and k, and then prints the result of the calculation n if n - k > 1 else 1.

The logic behind this calculation is as follows:

- If n - k > 1, it means that even after destroying k bridges, there are still more than one bridge left between island 1 and the other islands. In this case, Everule can still visit all the islands, so the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit is n.

- If n - k <= 1, it means that after destroying k bridges, there is either one bridge left or no bridges left between island 1 and the other islands. In this case, Dominater can destroy the remaining bridges to isolate island 1 from the other islands, so the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit is 1.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
