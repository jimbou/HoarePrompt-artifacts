Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

The key insight here is that if k is less than n-1, then Dominater cannot isolate island 1 from all other islands, because there are n-1 bridges connected to island 1, and destroying less than n-1 bridges will always leave at least one bridge connected to island 1. Therefore, Everule can always visit all islands if k is less than n-1.

On the other hand, if k is greater than or equal to n-1, then Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it from all other islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1.

The program correctly implements this logic by printing n if n-k > 1 (i.e., k is less than n-1), and printing 1 otherwise (i.e., k is greater than or equal to n-1).

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
