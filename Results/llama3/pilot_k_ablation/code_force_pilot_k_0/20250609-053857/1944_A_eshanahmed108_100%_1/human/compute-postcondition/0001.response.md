Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it calculates and prints the result of the expression n if n - k > 1, otherwise 1. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by an initial integer t, and outputs a corresponding number of results.**
