Determines the maximum number of cows that can be defeated by a given cow in a competition, considering the possibility of swapping the given cow with a stronger one. The function takes no parameters and returns the maximum number of defeatable cows, which is either the number of cows with a rating less than or equal to the given cow's rating minus one, or the number of cows with a rating less than or equal to the given cow's rating plus one, minus the number of cows with a rating less than or equal to the given cow's rating, plus one if there are any cows with a rating less than or equal to the given cow's rating.
