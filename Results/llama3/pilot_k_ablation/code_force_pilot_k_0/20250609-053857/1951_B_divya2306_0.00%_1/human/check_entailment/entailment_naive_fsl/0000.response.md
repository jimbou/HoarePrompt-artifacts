Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3

The program will output 1, which is correct. However, if the input is:

3
6 5
7 2 727 10 12 13

The program will output 2, which is also correct. But if the input is:

2 2
1000000000 1

The program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, because the cow with the highest rating (1000000000) will win all matches.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where the cow with the highest rating is in the first position. The program assumes that the cow with the highest rating will always be in a later position, which is not always the case.
