Output State: The number of integers in list a that are less than or equal to the integer at index k-1 plus 1, and if the current value of wins is greater than or equal to k, then the value of wins - 1 is printed, with wins_with_swap incremented by the number of iterations of the loop where a[i] is less than or equal to a[k-1].
