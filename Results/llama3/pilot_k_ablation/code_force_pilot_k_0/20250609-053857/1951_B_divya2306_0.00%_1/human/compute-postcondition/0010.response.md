Output: **`wins_with_swap` is the number of integers in list a that are less than or equal to the integer at index k-1 plus 1, and if the current value of wins is greater than or equal to k, then the value of wins - 1 is printed, and the maximum value between the difference of wins and 1, and the difference of wins_with_swap and the sum of wins and 1, plus 1 if wins is greater than 0 is printed**
