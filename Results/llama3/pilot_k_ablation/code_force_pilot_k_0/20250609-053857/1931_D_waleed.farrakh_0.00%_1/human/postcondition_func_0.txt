This function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers and counting the number of pairs that satisfy two conditions: `num1 % x == -num2 % x` and `num1 % y == num2 % y`. The function returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of pairs satisfying the conditions in each test case. The input list of test cases remains unchanged.
