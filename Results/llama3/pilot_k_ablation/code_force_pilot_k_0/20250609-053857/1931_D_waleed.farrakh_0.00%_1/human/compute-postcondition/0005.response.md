Output State: The loop has executed all iterations, printing each result in the `results` list. The `results` list remains unchanged, still containing the values returned by `func_1(test_cases)`. The `test_cases` list, `t` integer, `data` list, and `idx` integer remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
