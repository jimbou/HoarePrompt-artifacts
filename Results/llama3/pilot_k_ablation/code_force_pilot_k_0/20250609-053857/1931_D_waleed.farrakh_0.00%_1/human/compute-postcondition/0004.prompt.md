Given a Python loop, and an initial execution state, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `results` is returned with the value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer equal to the first line of stdin, data is a list of strings split from stdin, idx is 2 * t + 1.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
The output state must be in a similar format as the initial execution state. describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans. In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**.
