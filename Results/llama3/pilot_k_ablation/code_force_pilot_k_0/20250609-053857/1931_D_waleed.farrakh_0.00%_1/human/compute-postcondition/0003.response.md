Output State: **`results` is returned with the value of `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer equal to the first line of stdin, data is a list of strings split from stdin, idx is 2 * t + 1.**

The code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `test_cases` and assigns the returned value to the variable `results`. The values of the other variables, `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, and `idx`, remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, so the exact value of `results` cannot be determined. However, it is clear that `results` will hold the output of the function `func_1` when executed with the input `test_cases`.
