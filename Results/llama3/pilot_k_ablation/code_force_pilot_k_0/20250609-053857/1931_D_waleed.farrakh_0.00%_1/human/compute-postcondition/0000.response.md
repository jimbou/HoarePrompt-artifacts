Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples, each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers, t is an integer equal to the first line of stdin, data is a list of strings split from stdin, idx is 1.**

The code reads the entire standard input into the `input` variable using `sys.stdin.read`. It then splits the input into a list of strings using the `splitlines` method and assigns it to the `data` variable. The first line of the input is converted to an integer and assigned to the `t` variable. The `test_cases` list is initialized as an empty list. The `idx` variable is set to 1.
