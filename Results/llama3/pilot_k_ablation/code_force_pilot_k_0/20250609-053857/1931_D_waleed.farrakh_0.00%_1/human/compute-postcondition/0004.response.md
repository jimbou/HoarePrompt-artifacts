Output State: The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `result` has taken the value of each element in the `results` list one by one, and the `print()` function has been executed for each element in the `results` list, printing each element to the console. The values of `test_cases`, `t`, `data`, and `idx` remain unchanged.
