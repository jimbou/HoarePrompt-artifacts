Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided program is designed to find the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if the sum of the elements at those indices is divisible by x and the difference is divisible by y.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array, the favorite integers x and y, and the array itself. It then iterates over each test case, using two dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` to keep track of the remainders of the elements in the array when divided by x and y, respectively.

For each element in the array, it calculates the remainder when divided by x and y, and checks if the corresponding remainders are present in the dictionaries. If they are, it increments the count of beautiful pairs. It then updates the dictionaries with the current element's remainders.

`func_2` reads the input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls `func_1` to calculate the results. It then prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all possible cases, including when the array is empty, when x or y is 1, and when the array contains duplicate elements.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
