Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers and counting the number of pairs that satisfy the two conditions. The function returns a list of counts, where each count corresponds to the number of pairs satisfying the conditions in each test case.

func_2 reads input from the standard input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to process the test cases. It then prints the results.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that func_1 correctly implements the logic to count the number of beautiful pairs in each test case. func_2 correctly reads the input, parses it into test cases, and calls func_1 to process the test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
