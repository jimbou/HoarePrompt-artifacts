Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array, where a pair of indices (i, j) is considered beautiful if a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Function 1 (func_1) is designed to solve this problem. It iterates through each test case, and for each test case, it initializes two dictionaries (mod_x and mod_y) to store the remainders of the array elements when divided by x and y, respectively. It also initializes a count variable to store the number of beautiful pairs.

The function then iterates through each element in the array. For each element, it calculates the remainder when divided by x (rem_x) and the remainder when divided by y (rem_y). It then checks if the negative of rem_x is present in mod_x and rem_y is present in mod_y. If both conditions are true, it increments the count by the product of the values of mod_x[-rem_x] and mod_y[rem_y]. This is because for each element, we are counting the number of pairs that can be formed with the current element as the first element of the pair.

After that, it updates the mod_x and mod_y dictionaries by incrementing the count of the current element's remainder when divided by x and y, respectively.

Finally, it appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the results list.

Function 2 (func_2) is designed to read the input from the standard input and call Function 1 to solve the problem. It reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the array, the favorite integers x and y, and the array elements. It then calls Function 1 with the test cases and prints the results.

The time complexity of Function 1 is O(n), where n is the total number of elements in all test cases. This is because it iterates through each element in the array once.

The space complexity of Function 1 is also O(n), as it stores the remainders of the array elements in the mod_x and mod_y dictionaries.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient in solving the problem.

Correctness: **True**
