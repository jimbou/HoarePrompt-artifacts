Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program uses two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing the size of the array (n), the favorite integers x and y, and the array itself. It then iterates over each test case, initializing two dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` to store the remainders of the array elements when divided by x and y, respectively.

For each element in the array, it calculates the remainder when the negative of the element is divided by x (`rem_x`) and the remainder when the element is divided by y (`rem_y`). It then increments the count of beautiful pairs by the product of the number of elements in `mod_x` with the same remainder as `rem_x` and the number of elements in `mod_y` with the same remainder as `rem_y`. This is because for each element with remainder `rem_x` in `mod_x`, there are `mod_x[rem_x]` elements that can form a beautiful pair with the current element, and similarly for `mod_y`.

Finally, `func_1` returns a list of counts of beautiful pairs for each test case.

`func_2` reads the input from stdin, parses it into a list of test cases, and calls `func_1` with this list. It then prints the results.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic for finding beautiful pairs as described in the problem statement. The use of dictionaries to store the remainders of the array elements when divided by x and y allows for efficient counting of beautiful pairs.
