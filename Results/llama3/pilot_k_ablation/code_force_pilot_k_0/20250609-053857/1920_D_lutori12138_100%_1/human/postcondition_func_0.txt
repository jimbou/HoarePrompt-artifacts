This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first two integers are n and q, followed by n pairs of integers (b, x), and finally q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q. It returns the value at index x in the list b, where x is an integer that is the first element of the original list of integers and also an element of b. If x is not in b, it iterates through all elements in list a, updating the value of x in each iteration. If x becomes equal to any value in list b during iteration, it returns the corresponding value from b. If x never becomes equal to any value in b after iteration, it returns the final value of x.
