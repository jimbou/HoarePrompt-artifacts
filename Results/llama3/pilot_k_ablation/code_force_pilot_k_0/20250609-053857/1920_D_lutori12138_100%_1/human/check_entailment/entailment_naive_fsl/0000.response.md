Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, which is used to resolve queries. This function does not correctly handle the case when the query index is greater than the length of the array `a`. In such cases, the function will enter an infinite loop, causing the program to fail.

For example, consider the input:

```
1
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20
```

In this case, the array `a` will be `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3]`, and the query indices will be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 14, 15, 16, 20]`. However, the `func_1` function will not correctly handle the query index `20`, which is greater than the length of the array `a`.

To fix this issue, the `func_1` function needs to be modified to correctly handle query indices that are greater than the length of the array `a`. One possible solution is to use a different approach to resolve queries, such as using a binary search algorithm to find the correct index in the array `a`.
