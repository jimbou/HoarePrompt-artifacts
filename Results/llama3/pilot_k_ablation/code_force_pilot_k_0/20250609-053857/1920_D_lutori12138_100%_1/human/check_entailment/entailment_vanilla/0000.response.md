Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by initializing an empty array `a` and an empty dictionary `b`. It then reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It then iterates over each operation.
3.  If the operation is of type 1 (appending an integer), it increments the last element of array `a` by 1 and stores the appended integer in dictionary `b` with the current length of `a` as the key.
4.  If the operation is of type 2 (appending copies of the array), it calculates the new length of the array by multiplying the current length by the number of copies plus 1, and appends this new length to array `a`.
5.  After all operations are processed, the program reverses array `a` to maintain the correct order of lengths.
6.  The program then reads the queries and applies the `func_1` function to each query. The `func_1` function takes a query `x` and finds the corresponding value in dictionary `b` by repeatedly taking the modulus of `x` with the lengths in array `a` until it finds a key in `b`.
7.  Finally, the program prints the results of the queries.

Based on this analysis, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
