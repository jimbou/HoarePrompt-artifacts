#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first two integers are n and q, followed by n pairs of integers (b, x), and finally q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value at index x in the list b, where x is an integer that is the first element of the original list of integers and also an element of b.
    #State: *x is an integer, which is the first element of the original list of integers, n pairs of integers (b, x) and q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q are lost. x is not in b
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: The loop will iterate through all elements in list a, updating the value of x in each iteration. If x becomes equal to any value in list b, the loop will terminate and return the corresponding value from b. If x never becomes equal to any value in b, the loop will complete all iterations and the final value of x will be the result of the last iteration. The values of n, q, k_1, k_2, ..., k_q remain unchanged.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first two integers are n and q, followed by n pairs of integers (b, x), and finally q integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_q. It returns the value at index x in the list b, where x is an integer that is the first element of the original list of integers and also an element of b. If x is not in b, it iterates through all elements in list a, updating the value of x in each iteration. If x becomes equal to any value in list b during iteration, it returns the corresponding value from b. If x never becomes equal to any value in b after iteration, it returns the final value of x.
