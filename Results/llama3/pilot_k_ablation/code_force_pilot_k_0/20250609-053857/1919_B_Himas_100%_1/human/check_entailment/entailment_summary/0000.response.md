Reasoning: 
The given program is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. The problem asks to find the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The program correctly calculates the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string, which correspond to 1 and -1 in the array, respectively. It then calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The program's logic is sound because the minimum possible penalty is achieved when the array is split into subarrays with the maximum possible length, which is the entire array itself. In this case, the penalty is simply the absolute value of the sum of the array, which is calculated by the program.

Correctness: **True**
