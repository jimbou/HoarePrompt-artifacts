Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string and then printing the absolute difference between the two counts. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, resulting in a penalty equal to the absolute difference between the two counts.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

*   When the string consists only of '+' characters, the program correctly prints the length of the string.
*   When the string consists only of '-' characters, the program correctly prints the length of the string.
*   When the string contains both '+' and '-' characters, the program correctly prints the absolute difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the input string is empty or when the input string contains only one character.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
