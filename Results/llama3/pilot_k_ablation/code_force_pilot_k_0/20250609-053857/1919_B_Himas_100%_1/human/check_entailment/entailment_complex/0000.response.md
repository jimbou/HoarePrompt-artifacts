Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string, which represents the minimum possible penalty. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together, resulting in two subarrays with sums equal to the number of '+' and '-' characters, respectively. The penalty for each subarray is then the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, which is equal to the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters.

The program correctly implements this logic by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in each string and printing the absolute difference between them.

Correctness: **True**
