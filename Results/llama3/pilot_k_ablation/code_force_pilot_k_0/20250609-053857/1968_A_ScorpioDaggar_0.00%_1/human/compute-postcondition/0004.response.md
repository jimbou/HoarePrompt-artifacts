Output State: num is t, L1 is a list containing t integers x, res is a list containing at most t integers, stdin is empty.

In natural language, the output state is: The number of iterations is still t, the list L1 remains unchanged with t integers, the result list res now contains at most t integers (one for each iteration of the outer loop), and the standard input stdin is still empty.
