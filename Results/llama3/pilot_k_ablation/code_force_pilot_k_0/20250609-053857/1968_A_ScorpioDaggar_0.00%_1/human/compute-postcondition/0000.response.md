The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `num`. Since stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000), `num` becomes `t`. Stdin now contains `t` space-separated integers `x`. The second line initializes an empty list `L1`. The third line initializes an empty list `res`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **num is t, L1 is an empty list, res is an empty list, stdin contains t space-separated integers x**
