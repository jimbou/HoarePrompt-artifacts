You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) and then t space-separated integers x (2 <= x <= 1000).
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: Output State: num is t, L1 is a list containing t integers x, res is an empty list, stdin is empty.
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: Output State: num is t, L1 is a list containing t integers x, res is a list containing at most t integers, stdin is empty.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state is: The number of iterations is still t, the list L1 remains unchanged with t integers, the result list res now contains at most t integers (one for each iteration of the outer loop), and the standard input stdin is still empty.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: at most t integers, one for each iteration of the outer loop, separated by newline characters

```

Return Postconditions: 

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
