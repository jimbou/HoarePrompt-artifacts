Based on the precondition, the `print` statement will print the elements of the `res` list, separated by newline characters (`\n`).

The `res` list contains at most `t` integers, where `t` is the number of iterations. Since the exact values of the integers in `res` are not specified, we can't provide a precise numerical output.

However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **at most t integers, one for each iteration of the outer loop, separated by newline characters**

In other words, the output will be a sequence of at most `t` integers, each on a new line, representing the results of each iteration of the outer loop.
