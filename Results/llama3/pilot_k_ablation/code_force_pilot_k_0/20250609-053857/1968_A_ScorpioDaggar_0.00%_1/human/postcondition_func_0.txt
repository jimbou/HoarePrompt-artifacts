The function takes an integer t and t space-separated integers x as input from the user, and for each integer x, it calculates and prints the product of the integer divided by its smallest divisor greater than 1 and the divisor minus 1, if such a divisor exists. If no such divisor exists for an integer x, it does not print anything for that integer. The function prints at most t integers, one for each input integer x, separated by newline characters.
