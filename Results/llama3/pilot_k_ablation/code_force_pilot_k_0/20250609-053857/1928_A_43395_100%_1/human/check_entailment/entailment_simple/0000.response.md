Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. 

The program first checks if both a and b are even. If they are, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle.

Then, it checks if one of a or b is even and the other is half of the even number. If this condition is met, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles and then rearranged to form a different rectangle.

If neither of these conditions is met, it prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
