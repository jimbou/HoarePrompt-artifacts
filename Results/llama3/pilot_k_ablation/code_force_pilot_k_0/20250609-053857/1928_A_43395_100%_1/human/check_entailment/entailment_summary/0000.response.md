Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the a x b rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then rotating and moving these two rectangles as he wishes.

The program uses a simple approach to solve this problem. It checks each pair of integers (a and b) to determine if both are even, or if one is even and the other is half of the even number. If either of these conditions is met, it prints 'yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if both a and b are even, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal halves and then rotate and move them to form a new rectangle. Similarly, if one of a or b is even and the other is half of the even number, Bob can cut the rectangle into two equal halves and then rotate and move them to form a new rectangle.

The program's execution summary shows that it correctly reads the input, checks the conditions, and prints the output as expected.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the program's execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
