Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program will print 'no', but the correct answer should be 'yes' because the 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1.5 rectangles, and from these, the 1.5x6 rectangle can be formed, which is different from the 3x3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sides of the rectangle are even or odd, but it does not consider the case where the sides are odd and the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides. 

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sides is greater than 1, because if the GCD is greater than 1, it means that the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides. 

Here is an example of how the program can be corrected:

```
import math

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b or math.gcd(a, b) == 1:
            print('no')
        else:
            print('yes')
```

This corrected program will work correctly for all cases.
