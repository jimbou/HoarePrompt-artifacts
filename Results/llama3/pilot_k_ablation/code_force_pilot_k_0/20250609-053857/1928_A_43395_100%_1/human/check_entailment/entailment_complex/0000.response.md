Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle by cutting it into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming a new rectangle from these two rectangles.

The program works by iterating over each test case, reading the dimensions of the rectangle (a and b), and then checking if both a and b are even, or if one is even and the other is half of the even number. If either of these conditions is met, it prints 'yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

However, the program does not correctly handle the case where a and b are both odd. In this case, Bob can still obtain another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides and then forming a new rectangle from these two rectangles. For example, if a = 3 and b = 5, Bob can cut the rectangle into two 3x2 rectangles and then form a 2x6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3x5 rectangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the case where a and b are both odd.

Correctness: **False**
