This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains two integers (a and b). It then checks each pair of integers to determine if both are even, or if one is even and the other is half of the even number. Based on this check, it prints 'yes' if the condition is met, and 'no' otherwise, resulting in t lines of output.
