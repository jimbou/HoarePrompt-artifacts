#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0.
    if (b == 0) :
        return 1, 0
        #The program returns two values: 1, which is an integer, and 0, which is also an integer and is equal to the initial value of variable b.
    #State: *a and b are integers and b is not equal to 0
    if (a < b) :
        c, d = func_1(b, a)
        return d, c
        #The program returns the values of `d` and `c`, which are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`, where `a` is an integer less than `b`, and `b` is a non-zero integer.
    #State: a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, and a is not less than b
    if (a % b == 0) :
        return 1, -(a // b - 1)
        #The program returns a tuple containing two values: 1 and -(a // b - 1). The first value is a constant integer 1. The second value is the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Since a is a multiple of b, a // b is an integer. The value of a // b is at least 1, because a is not less than b. Therefore, the second value is a negative integer.
    #State: *a and b are integers, b is not equal to 0, a is not less than b, and a is not divisible by b
    c, d = func_1(b, a % b)
    return d, c - a // b * d
    #The program returns two values: `d` which is one of the returned values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between the other returned value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns two values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the result. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the result of the function call, along with the difference between the other returned value and the product of the integer division of a by b and the first returned value.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are non-negative integers, and a and b are used as arguments to the function func_1 which returns a tuple (c, d) where c is used to calculate the return value of func_2.
    c, d = func_1(b, 1000000007)
    return c * a % 1000000007
    #The program returns the product of a non-negative integer 'a' and the return value 'c' of function func_1(b, 1000000007), modulo 1000000007.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes two non-negative integers 'a' and 'b' as input, uses 'b' to compute a value 'c' through a call to function func_1, and then returns the product of 'a' and 'c' modulo 1000000007.
