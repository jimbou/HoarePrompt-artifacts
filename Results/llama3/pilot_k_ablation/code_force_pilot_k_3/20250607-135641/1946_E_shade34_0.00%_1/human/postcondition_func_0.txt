This function takes two integers, a and b, as input and returns two values. If b is zero, it returns 1 and 0. If a is less than b, it calls another function, func_1, with b and a as arguments and returns the result. If a is a multiple of b, it returns 1 and the negative of the difference between the integer division of a by b and 1. Otherwise, it calls func_1 with b and the remainder of a divided by b as arguments, and returns the result of the function call, along with the difference between the other returned value and the product of the integer division of a by b and the first returned value.
