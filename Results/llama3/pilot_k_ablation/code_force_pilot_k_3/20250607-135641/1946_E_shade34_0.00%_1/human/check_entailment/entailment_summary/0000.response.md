Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, as there are no valid permutations.

Otherwise, it calculates the number of permutations by iterating over the suffix maximums and prefix maximums. For each suffix maximum, it calculates the number of combinations using the `func_2` function, which is a modular multiplicative inverse function. It then multiplies the result with the previous result and takes the modulus 1000000007.

The `func_2` function is also correct. It uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of the second argument, and then multiplies the first argument with the result and takes the modulus 1000000007.

The `func_1` function is a recursive function that calculates the modular multiplicative inverse using the extended Euclidean algorithm. It is correct and works as expected.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` are correct and work as expected.
