Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to output the number of different permutations that could have been guessed, but the program does not provide any function or logic to calculate this number. The provided functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, seem to be related to modular arithmetic, but they do not appear to be used to solve the problem.

A correct solution would involve calculating the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions, which would require a more complex algorithm or data structure. The provided code does not attempt to solve this problem, and therefore, it is incorrect.
