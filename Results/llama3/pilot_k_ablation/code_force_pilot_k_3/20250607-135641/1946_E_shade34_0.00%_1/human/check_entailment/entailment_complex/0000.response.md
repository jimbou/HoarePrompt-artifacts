Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving permutations of length n, where the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums are provided. The program uses two functions, func_1 and func_2, to calculate the number of suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7.

Function func_1 is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'b' modulo 1000000007. It uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients 'c' and 'd' such that a*c + b*d = gcd(a, b). The function returns the value of 'c', which is used to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse.

Function func_2 uses the result of func_1 to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of a number 'b' modulo 1000000007. It multiplies the input 'a' with the result of func_1 and takes the modulus 1000000007.

The main program calculates the number of suitable permutations by iterating over the prefix maximums and suffix maximums. It uses the func_2 function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse of the factorial of the remaining elements and multiplies it with the result of the previous iteration.

The program correctly handles the cases where the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not match, or where the prefix maximums or suffix maximums are not in increasing order. It also correctly calculates the modular multiplicative inverse using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm.

Therefore, the given program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
