Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program first checks if the last prefix maximum is equal to the first suffix maximum, and if the first prefix maximum is 1 and the last suffix maximum is n. If any of these conditions are not met, it prints 0, which is correct because the permutation cannot be guessed.

If the conditions are met, the program calculates the number of permutations using the formula for combinations. It uses the `func_2` function to calculate the combinations, which in turn uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse.

The `func_1` function is a recursive function that calculates the modular multiplicative inverse using the extended Euclidean algorithm. It correctly handles the base cases and the recursive case.

The `func_2` function uses the `func_1` function to calculate the modular multiplicative inverse and then calculates the combination using the formula `c * a % 1000000007`.

The program correctly calculates the number of permutations by multiplying the combinations for each suffix maximum and prefix maximum, and then prints the result modulo 1000000007.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
