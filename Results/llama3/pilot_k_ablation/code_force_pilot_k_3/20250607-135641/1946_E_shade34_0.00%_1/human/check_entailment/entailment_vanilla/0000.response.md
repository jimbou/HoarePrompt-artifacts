Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed given the indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program provided consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` appears to be implementing the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the modular multiplicative inverse of a number. This is used in `func_2` to calculate the modular exponentiation.

However, there is no main function or code that actually solves the problem. The functions provided seem to be utility functions for calculating modular arithmetic, but they are not used to solve the problem.

Therefore, the program is incomplete and does not solve the problem.

Correctness: **False**
