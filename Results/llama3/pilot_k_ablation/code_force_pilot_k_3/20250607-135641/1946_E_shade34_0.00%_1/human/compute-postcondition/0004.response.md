Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is less than `b`, `c` and `d` are the return values of `func_1(b, a)`**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and their relationship (`a` is less than `b`) is still valid. The code introduces two new variables, `c` and `d`, which are assigned the return values of the function `func_1(b, a)`. The specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
