Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer not equal to 0, `a` is not less than `b`, `a` is not divisible by `b`, `c` and `d` are the returned values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, where `a % b` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The code only assigns the returned values of `func_1(b, a % b)` to `c` and `d`. The remainder of `a` divided by `b` is calculated and passed as an argument to `func_1`, but the specific values of `c` and `d` depend on the implementation of `func_1`, which is not provided.
