Output State: **The program returns two values: `d` which is one of the returned values of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `c - a // b * d` which is the difference between the other returned value of `func_1(b, a % b)` and the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `d`.**

In this output state, `d` is one of the returned values of the function `func_1` when called with arguments `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. The second returned value is a calculation involving `c`, which is the other returned value of `func_1(b, a % b)`, and `d`. The calculation `a // b` performs integer division, which means it returns the largest whole number that is less than or equal to the result of the division, and this result is then multiplied by `d`. This product is then subtracted from `c` to get the second returned value.
