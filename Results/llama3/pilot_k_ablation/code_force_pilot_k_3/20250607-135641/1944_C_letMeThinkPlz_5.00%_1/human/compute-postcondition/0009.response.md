Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is the last integer in arr.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the counter dictionary will contain all unique integers from the array as keys and their respective counts as values. The loop will have iterated over the entire array, and the variable i will hold the last integer in the array. The other variables, t, _, n, and stdin, remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
