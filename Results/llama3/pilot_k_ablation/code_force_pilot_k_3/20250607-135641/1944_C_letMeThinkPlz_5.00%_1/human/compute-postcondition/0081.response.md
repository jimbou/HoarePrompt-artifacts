Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each integer in `arr` is incremented by the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers from the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, the state remains unchanged. If the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, then if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.***
