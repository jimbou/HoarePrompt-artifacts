The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in arr, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers**
