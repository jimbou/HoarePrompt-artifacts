Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in arr, i is the last integer in arr, ans is 0, once is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that modify the values of `ans` and `once`. The first line sets `ans` to 0, overwriting its previous value as the smallest positive integer that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in `arr`. The second line sets `once` to False, changing its previous value from True.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged: `t` is still an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is still 1, `n` is still an integer, `counter` is still a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value as the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is still the last integer in `arr`, and `arr` is still a list of `n` integers. Additionally, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines.
