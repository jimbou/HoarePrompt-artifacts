Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in `arr` is greater than 0, then if `once` is False, `once` is set to True and `ans` is set to 2.***
