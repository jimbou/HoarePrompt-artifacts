Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to 0, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, ans is either 0, 1, or the value of i + 1 when the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, and once is True if the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, otherwise once is False.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `_`, `counter`, `arr`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop may have executed zero or more times. The value of `ans` is either 0, 1, or the value of `i + 1` when the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False. The value of `once` is True if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, otherwise it is False.
