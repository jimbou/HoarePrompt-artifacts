Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each integer in `arr` is incremented by the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of n integers from the second input, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the counter dictionary now contains the count of each integer in the list `arr`, and the variable `i` is the last integer in the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
