Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer, counter is an empty dictionary, i is the last integer in arr, ans is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr, once is True, and ans is printed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers**

The code reads two lines from stdin, assigning the first line to `n` and the second line to `arr`. The `counter` dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `ans`, and `once` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that two lines have been read. The state of `arr` is updated to reflect that it now contains a list of `n` integers.
