Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of `n` integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is the last integer in arr, ans is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr, once is True, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or is in `arr` but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in `arr` that appears only once, False otherwise, and the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or is in `arr` but its count is 1 which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to 0, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, ans is either 0, 1, or the value of i + 1 when the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, and once is True if the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, otherwise once is False, and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
