Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in arr, i is the last integer in arr, ans is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr, once is True, ans is printed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the counter dictionary will have all the integers in the array as keys and their respective counts as values. The variable i will be the last integer in the array. The other variables remain unchanged.
