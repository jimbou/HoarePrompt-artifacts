The code `counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1` increments the count of the integer `i` in the dictionary `counter` by 1. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `arr`, the count of `i` in `counter` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is the first integer in `arr`.**
