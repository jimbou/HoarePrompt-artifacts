Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 1, n is greater than 1, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in arr, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers, once is True, ans is 3.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `counter`, `i`, `stdin`, and `arr` remain unchanged from the initial state. The only changes are to the variables `once` and `ans`. The variable `once` is set to `True`, and the variable `ans` is set to `i + 1`, which is `3` since `i` is `2`.
