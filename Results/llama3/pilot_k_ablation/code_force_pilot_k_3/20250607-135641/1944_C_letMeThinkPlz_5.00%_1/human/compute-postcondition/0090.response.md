Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is greater than 1, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the count of i in counter is 0, then ans is 1. If the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, then ans is i + 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and once remains False.***
