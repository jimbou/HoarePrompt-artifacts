Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 1, once is True, ans is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `once` has been set to `True` and the value of `ans` has been set to `i + 1`, which is 2, since `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables but rather exits the loop or control structure it is part of.
