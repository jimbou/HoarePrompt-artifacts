The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the second integer in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in `arr`, `once` is True, `ans` is printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers.**
