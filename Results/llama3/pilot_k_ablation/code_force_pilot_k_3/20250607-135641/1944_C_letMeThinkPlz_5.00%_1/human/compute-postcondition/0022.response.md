Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 1. If the value of i is present in the counter dictionary with a count equal to 1 and once is False, then ans is 2 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0.***
