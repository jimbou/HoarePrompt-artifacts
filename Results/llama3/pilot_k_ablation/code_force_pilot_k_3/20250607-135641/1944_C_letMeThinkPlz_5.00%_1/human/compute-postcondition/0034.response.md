The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `i` is the last integer in `arr`, so for the loop to be executed `arr` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first integer in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in `arr`, `once` is True, `ans` is printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer**
