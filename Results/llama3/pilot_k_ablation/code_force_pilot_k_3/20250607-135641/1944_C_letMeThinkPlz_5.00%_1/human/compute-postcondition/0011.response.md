According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is the last integer in arr, ans is 0, once is False does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of n integers, `counter` is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `once` is False**
