Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the second integer in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in `arr`, `once` is True, `ans` is printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `counter[i]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to reflect the increased count of `i` in `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `stdin` are still valid. The value of `counter[i]` is now one more than its previous value, indicating that `i` has been encountered one more time in `arr`.
