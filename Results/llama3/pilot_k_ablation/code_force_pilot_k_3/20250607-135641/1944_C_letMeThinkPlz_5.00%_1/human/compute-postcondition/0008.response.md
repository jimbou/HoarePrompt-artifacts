Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 3 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and a value greater than or equal to 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is the third integer in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been incremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and `i` is still the third integer in `arr`.
