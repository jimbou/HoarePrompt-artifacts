Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of n integers, `counter` is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `once` is False. The current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, meaning that the value of `i` does not appear in `arr` or appears 0 times.**
