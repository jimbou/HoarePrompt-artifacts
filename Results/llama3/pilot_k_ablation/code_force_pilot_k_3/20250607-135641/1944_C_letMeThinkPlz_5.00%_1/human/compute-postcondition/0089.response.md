Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is greater than 1, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, once is True, ans is i + 1.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `counter`, `arr`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The code only affects the values of `once` and `ans`. The first line sets `once` to `True`, and the second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.
