Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by a line of n integers. It then finds the smallest missing non-negative integer in the range [0, n) that appears either zero or one times in the input list. If no such integer is found, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the smallest missing integer that appears zero times or the smallest integer that appears once, whichever is smaller. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.**
