The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 integers the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is the second integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers from the second input, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise**
