Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in arr, i is the last integer in arr, ans is 0, once is False, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the count of `i` in `arr` is greater than 0, then if the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is set to 1 and `once` is set to True. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in `arr` is greater than 0, then if `once` is False, `once` is set to True and `ans` is set to 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in `arr` is greater than 0, then if `once` is False, `ans` is set to 2 if the count of `i` in `arr` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is set to 3. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
