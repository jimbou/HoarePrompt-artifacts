The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^5 + 1 inclusive and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i` so `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each integer in `arr` is incremented by the number of times it appears in `arr`, `arr` is a list of `n` integers from the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is 1. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is `True`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains `False`.**
