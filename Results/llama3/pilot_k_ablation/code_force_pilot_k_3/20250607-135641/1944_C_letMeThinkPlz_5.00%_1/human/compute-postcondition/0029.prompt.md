Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is the last integer in arr, ans is 0, once is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 0, if the value of i is present in the counter dictionary with a count equal to 1 and once is False, then ans is 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 1. If the value of i is not present in the counter dictionary, then ans is 1 and once is True. If the value of i is present in the counter dictionary with a count equal to 1 and once is False, then ans is 2 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 2. If the value of i is not present in the counter dictionary, then ans is 1 and once is True. If the value of i is present in the counter dictionary with a count equal to 1 and once is False, then ans is 2 and once is True. If the value of i is present in the counter dictionary with a count equal to 1 and once is False, then ans is 3 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
