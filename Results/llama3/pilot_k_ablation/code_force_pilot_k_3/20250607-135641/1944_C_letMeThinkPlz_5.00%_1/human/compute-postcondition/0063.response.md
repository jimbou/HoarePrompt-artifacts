To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` is 2.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `counter`, `i`, `stdin`, `arr`, `ans`, and `once`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or is in `arr` but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in `arr` that appears only once, False otherwise**
