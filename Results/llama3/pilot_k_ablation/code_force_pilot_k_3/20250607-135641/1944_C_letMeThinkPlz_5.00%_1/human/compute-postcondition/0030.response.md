The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in `arr`. Since the exact values of `arr` and `counter` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest positive integer that meets the specified conditions.

Output: **the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr**
