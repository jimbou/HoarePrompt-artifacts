Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 2, ans is 2, once is True.**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, which is 2. Since `i` is 2 and `once` is False, `ans` becomes 2 and `once` becomes True. No other variables are affected.
