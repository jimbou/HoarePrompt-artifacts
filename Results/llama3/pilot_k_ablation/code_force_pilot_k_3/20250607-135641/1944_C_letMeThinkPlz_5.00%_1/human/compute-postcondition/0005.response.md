To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in arr:`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the first integer in `arr`, and `arr` has at least 1 integer.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next integer in `arr`. Since `i` is the first integer in `arr` at the end of the last iteration, it will be the second integer in `arr` at the start of the next iteration.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is the second integer in `arr`.**
