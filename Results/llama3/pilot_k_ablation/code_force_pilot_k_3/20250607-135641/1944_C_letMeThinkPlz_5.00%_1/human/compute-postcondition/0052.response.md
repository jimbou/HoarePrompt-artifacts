The code snippet consists of three lines: `once = True`, `ans = i + 1`, and `break`. 

The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `once`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to the variable `ans`. Since `i` is 1, `ans` becomes 2. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables but rather exits the loop or control structure it is part of.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. The value of `t` remains an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` remains 1, `n` remains greater than 1, `counter` remains a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` remains 1, `stdin` remains containing multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and `arr` remains a list of `n` integers.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 1, n is greater than 1, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in arr, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers, once is True, ans is 2**
