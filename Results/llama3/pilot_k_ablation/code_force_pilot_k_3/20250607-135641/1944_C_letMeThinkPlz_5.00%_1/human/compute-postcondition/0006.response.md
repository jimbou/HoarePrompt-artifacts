Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and a value greater than or equal to 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is the second integer in `arr`.**

The value of `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, since `counter.get(i, 0)` returns the current value of `counter[i]` (which is 1) and then adds 1 to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
