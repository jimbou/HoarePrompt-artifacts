Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is the integer value of the first input, counter is an empty dictionary, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, ans is the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, once is True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the first input. The `counter` dictionary has been reset to an empty dictionary. The `arr` list now contains `n` integers from the second input. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `stdin`, `ans`, and `once` remain unchanged.
