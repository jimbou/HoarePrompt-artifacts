Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is 2, once is True, ans is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it was not affected by the code. The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 2, and the list `arr` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The dictionary `counter` also remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The value of `stdin` remains multiple test cases minus 2 lines as it was not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 2 as it was not modified by the code. The value of `once` is now True as it was assigned True by the code. The value of `ans` is now 3 as it was assigned the value of `i + 1` by the code.
