The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers.**
