Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers from the second input, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise, and the count of `i` in `counter` is incremented by 1**

The code increments the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary by 1. The value of `i` is the third integer in the list, and the count of `i` in `counter` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, and the `arr` is still a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers from the second input. The `ans` is still the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, and `once` is still True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise.
