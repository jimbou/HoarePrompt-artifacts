Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of n integers, `counter` is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, and the value of i is present in the counter dictionary with a count greater than 0. The current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is still False.***
