Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers. If the count of `i` in `arr` is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the count of `i` in `arr` is greater than 0, then if the count of `i` in `arr` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is set to 1 and `once` is set to True. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.***
