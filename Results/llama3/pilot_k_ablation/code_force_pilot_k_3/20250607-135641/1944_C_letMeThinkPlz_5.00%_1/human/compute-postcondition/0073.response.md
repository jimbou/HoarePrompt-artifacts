Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is the integer value of the first input, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, i is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, ans is 0, once is False**

The code snippet assigns the value 0 to `ans` and sets `once` to False. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state remains valid for all other variables.
