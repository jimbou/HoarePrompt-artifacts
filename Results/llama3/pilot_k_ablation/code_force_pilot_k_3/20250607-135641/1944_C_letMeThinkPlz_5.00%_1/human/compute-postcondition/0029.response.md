Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is the last integer in arr, ans is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr, once is True.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for t, _, n, arr, counter, stdin, and i as in the initial state. However, the value of ans will be the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr. The value of once will be True.
