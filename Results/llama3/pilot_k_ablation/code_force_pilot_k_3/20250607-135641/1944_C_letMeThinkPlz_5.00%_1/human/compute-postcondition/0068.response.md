Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is the second integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers from the second input, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise, and the count of `i` in `counter` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, and `_` is still 2. The value of `n` is still the integer value of the first input. The dictionary `counter` now has the count of `i` incremented by 1. The value of `i` is still the second integer in the list. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. The list `arr` still contains n integers that must have at least 2 integers from the second input. The value of `ans` is still the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1. The value of `once` is still True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise. Additionally, the count of `i` in `counter` is incremented by 1.
