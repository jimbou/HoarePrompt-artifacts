Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in `arr` or is in `arr` but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in `arr` that appears only once, False otherwise.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, `n`, `counter`, `stdin`, and `arr` as in the initial state. The value of `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in `arr`. The value of `ans` will be the smallest integer that is not present in `arr` or is present in `arr` but appears only once. The value of `once` will be True if there exists an integer in `arr` that appears only once, and False otherwise.
