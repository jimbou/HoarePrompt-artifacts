To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `n` is the integer value of the first input, we can assume that `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0.

The state of `i` is not explicitly defined before the loop, but since it is used as the loop variable, we can assume that it will take on the values from 0 to `n-1` during the loop execution. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

The other variables, such as `t`, `_`, `counter`, `arr`, `ans`, and `once`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each integer in `arr` is incremented by the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers from the second input, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines**
