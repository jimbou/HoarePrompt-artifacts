The code prints the value of `ans`, which is either 0, 1, or the value of `i + 1` when the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False.

Since the exact value of `i` and the count of `i` in `counter` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value of `ans`.

Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is greater than or equal to 0, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, ans is either 0, 1, or the value of i + 1 when the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, and once is True if the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, otherwise once is False, and ans is printed**
