Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr` plus 1, `i` is the third integer in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in `arr`, `once` is True, `ans` is printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `counter[i]` is increased by 1, where `i` is the third integer in `arr`. The values of other variables remain the same. The `counter` dictionary now stores the updated count of `i` in `arr`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
