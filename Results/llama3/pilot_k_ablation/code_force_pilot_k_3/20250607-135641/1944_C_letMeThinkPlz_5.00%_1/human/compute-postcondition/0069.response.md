The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is the third integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers from the second input, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise, and the count of `i` in `counter` is incremented by 1**
