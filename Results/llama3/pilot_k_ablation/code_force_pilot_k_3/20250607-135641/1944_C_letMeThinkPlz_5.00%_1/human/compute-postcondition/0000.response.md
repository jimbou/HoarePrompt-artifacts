The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines, and the first line contains a single integer `n`, this integer `n` is assigned to `t`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The second line of each test case contains `n` integers, but this line is not read by the given code. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of `n` integers.
Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of `n` integers.**
