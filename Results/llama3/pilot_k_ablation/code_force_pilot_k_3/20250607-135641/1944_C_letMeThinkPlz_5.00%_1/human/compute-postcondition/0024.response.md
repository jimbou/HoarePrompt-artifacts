The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and a value equal to the number of times `i` appears in `arr`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `i` is 2. If the value of `i` is not present in the `counter` dictionary, then `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. If the value of `i` is present in the `counter` dictionary with a count equal to 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0.**
