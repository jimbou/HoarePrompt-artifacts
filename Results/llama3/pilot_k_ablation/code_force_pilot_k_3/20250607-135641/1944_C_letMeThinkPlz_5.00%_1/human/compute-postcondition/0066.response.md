Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is the integer value of the first input, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is the first integer in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer from the second input, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in arr or is in arr but its count is 1, `once` is True if there exists an integer in arr that appears only once, False otherwise**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first integer in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `counter` now contains the updated count of `i`. The rest of the variables maintain their initial values and properties.
