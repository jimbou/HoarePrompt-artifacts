The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and a value equal to the number of times i appears in arr, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, i is the last integer in arr, ans is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr, once is True, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in arr or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in arr)**
