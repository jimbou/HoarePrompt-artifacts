Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is the integer value of the first input, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, i is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, ans is 0, once is False
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each integer in `arr` is incremented by the number of times it appears in `arr`, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of `n` integers from the second input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, the state remains unchanged. If the count of `i` in `counter` is greater than 0, then if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is greater than 0, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the count of i in counter is 0, then ans is 1. If the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, then ans is 2 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and once remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, _ is 2, n is greater than 1, counter is a dictionary where the count of each integer in arr is incremented by the number of times it appears in arr, arr is a list of n integers from the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines. If the count of i in counter is 0, then ans is 1. If the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, then ans is either 2 or i + 1 depending on the previous value of ans, and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and once remains False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
