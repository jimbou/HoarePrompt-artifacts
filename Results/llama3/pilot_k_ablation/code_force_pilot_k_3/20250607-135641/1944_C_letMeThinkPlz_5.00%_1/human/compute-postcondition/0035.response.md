Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is the count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the first integer in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in `arr` or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in `arr`, `once` is True, `ans` is printed, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 lines, `arr` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been updated to include the count of the first integer `i` in `arr`. The count is incremented by 1 if `i` is already a key in `counter`, or set to 1 if `i` is not a key in `counter`. The other variables remain unchanged.
