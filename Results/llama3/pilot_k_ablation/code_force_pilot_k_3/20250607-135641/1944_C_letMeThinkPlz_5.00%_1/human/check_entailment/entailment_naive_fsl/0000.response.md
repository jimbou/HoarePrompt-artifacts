Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize the score in the game. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array, and then iterates through the numbers from 0 to n-1 to find the smallest number that is not present in the array or is present only once. This is because Alice wants to maximize the score, which is the MEX of the array c, and Bob wants to minimize it.

The program correctly handles the case where the array contains only one occurrence of a number, in which case Alice can choose that number to maximize the score. It also correctly handles the case where the array contains multiple occurrences of a number, in which case Alice can choose the smallest number that is not present in the array to maximize the score.

The program also correctly handles the case where the array is empty, in which case the score is 0.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
