Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. It creates a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array `arr`.
3. It iterates through the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to `n`) and checks if the current value is present in the `counter` dictionary.
4. If the current value is not present in the `counter` dictionary, it means that the MEX is equal to the current value, and the program sets `ans` to the current value and breaks the loop.
5. If the current value is present in the `counter` dictionary with a count of 1, and `once` is still `False`, it means that the current value is the smallest value that appears only once in the array. In this case, the program sets `ans` to the current value plus 1 and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can choose the current value, and Bob will be forced to choose the only other value that appears once, resulting in a MEX of `i + 1`.
6. If the loop completes without finding a MEX, it means that all values from 0 to `n` are present in the array, and the MEX is equal to `n + 1`. However, since the problem statement guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5, this case is not possible.
7. Finally, the program prints the calculated MEX value `ans`.

The program correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the MEX, and the logic is sound.

Correctness: **True**
