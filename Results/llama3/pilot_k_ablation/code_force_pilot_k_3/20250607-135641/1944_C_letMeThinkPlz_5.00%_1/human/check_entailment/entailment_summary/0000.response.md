Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize it. The program uses a counter to count the occurrences of each number in the array. It then iterates over the range [0, n) and checks if a number appears zero or one times. If it finds a number that appears zero times, it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If it finds a number that appears once and it's the first time it sees a number that appears once, it sets the answer to the next number and breaks the loop. This is because Alice can choose the number that appears once to maximize the score, and Bob can't choose it to minimize the score.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the input array contains only zeros or only ones. In these cases, the program prints 0, which is the correct answer.

Correctness: **True**
