Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the third integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers. If `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.***
