Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the code inside the current loop and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no assignments or modifications to the variables in the given code, the values of all variables remain the same. The only change is that the execution of the code inside the loop is skipped, and the loop moves to the next iteration.
