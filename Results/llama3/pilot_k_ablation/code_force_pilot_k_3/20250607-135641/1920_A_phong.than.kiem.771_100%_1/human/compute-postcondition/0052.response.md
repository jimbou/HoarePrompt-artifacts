Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the last integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers, `count_num` is the number of integers in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the last integer in the list `num`, `t` and `v` remain unchanged, `start` and `end` remain unchanged, `num` remains the same list of integers, and `count_num` is the total count of integers in `num` that fall within the range defined by `start` and `end`, inclusive.
