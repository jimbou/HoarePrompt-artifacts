Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer with a current value of 3, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`. If the current value of `t` was 2 and the value of `v` was less than or equal to `end`, then `end` was updated to `v`. Otherwise, no changes were made to `end`.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been appended to the list `num`, which was initially empty. The values of `n`, `i`, and `t` remain unchanged. The condition regarding `end` is still valid, as it depends on the previous values of `t` and `v`, which are not affected by the code snippet.
