Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is 1. Otherwise, the loop moves on to the next iteration and `count_num` remains 0.***
