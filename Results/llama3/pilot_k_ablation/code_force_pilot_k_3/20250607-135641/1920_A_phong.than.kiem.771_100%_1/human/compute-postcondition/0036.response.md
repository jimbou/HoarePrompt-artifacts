Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 100.
*   The value of `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
*   The value of `t` will be the last value read from the input, which is an integer.
*   The value of `v` will be the last value read from the input, which is an integer.
*   The value of `start` will be the maximum value of `v` that was read when `t` was 1, or -1 if no such value was read.
*   The value of `end` will be the minimum value of `v` that was read when `t` was 2, or 1000000000 if no such value was read.
*   The value of `num` will be a list of all the values of `v` that were read when `t` was 3.
