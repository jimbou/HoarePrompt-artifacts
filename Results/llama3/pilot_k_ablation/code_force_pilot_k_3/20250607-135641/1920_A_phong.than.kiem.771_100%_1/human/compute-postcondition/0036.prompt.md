Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 100, start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers t and v
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`. If the current value of `t` was 2 and the value of `v` was less than or equal to `end`, then `end` was updated to `v`. Otherwise, no changes were made to `end`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` (it now contains at least two values of `v`). If `t` is 2, then if `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, no changes were made to `end`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is an integer, if `end` is larger than `v`, `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `start` and `end`. If `t` is 3, then `num` is a list of integers that includes `v`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
