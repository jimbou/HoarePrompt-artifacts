Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` (it now contains at least two values of `v`). If `t` is 2, then if `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, no changes were made to `end`.***
