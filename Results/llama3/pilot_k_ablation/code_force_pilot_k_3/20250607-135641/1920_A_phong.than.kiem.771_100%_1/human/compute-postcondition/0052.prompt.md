Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers, `count_num` is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer. If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive), `count_num` is 1. Otherwise, the loop moves on to the next iteration and `count_num` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the third integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers. If `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`, no changes are made. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
