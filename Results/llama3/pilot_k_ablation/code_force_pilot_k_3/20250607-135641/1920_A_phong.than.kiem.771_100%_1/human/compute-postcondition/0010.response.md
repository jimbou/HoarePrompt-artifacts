Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer with a current value of 2, `num` is an empty list, `end` is equal to `v`**.

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`, which is one of the input values from the stdin. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-1 inputs, each containing two integers `t` and `v`. The condition that the current value of `end` is greater than the value of `v` is no longer valid, as `end` is now equal to `v`.
