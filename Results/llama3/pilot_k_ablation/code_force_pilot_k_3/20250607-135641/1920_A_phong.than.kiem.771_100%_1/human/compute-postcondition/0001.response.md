To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already an integer between 2 and 100, it meets this condition.

The variable `i` is initialized to 0 at the start of the loop, so we can adjust its state to reflect this.

The other variables `start`, `end`, `num`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `stdin` contains n inputs: each containing two integers t and v, `i` is 0**
