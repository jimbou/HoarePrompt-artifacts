Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `end` is equal to `v`. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `t` and their effects on `start` and `num` are still valid, but `end` is now directly equal to `v`, regardless of its previous value or the value of `t`.
