The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `num`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers**
