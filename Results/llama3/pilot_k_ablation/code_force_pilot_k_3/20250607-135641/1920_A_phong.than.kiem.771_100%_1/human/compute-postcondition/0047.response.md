Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the rest of the code inside the current loop is skipped and the next iteration of the loop is executed. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.***
