Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer equal to `v`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `start` is assigned the value of `v`, which is an integer. The values of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `t`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
