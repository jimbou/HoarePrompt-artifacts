Functionality: **This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of integers. It accepts no parameters and returns an integer value. The function reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n followed by n lines of input, each containing two integers t and v. It then processes these inputs to determine the range (start and end) and the list of integers (num). The function counts the number of integers in the list that fall within the specified range and returns the difference between the total numbers in the range and the count of integers in the list, or 0 if the start value exceeds the end value.**
