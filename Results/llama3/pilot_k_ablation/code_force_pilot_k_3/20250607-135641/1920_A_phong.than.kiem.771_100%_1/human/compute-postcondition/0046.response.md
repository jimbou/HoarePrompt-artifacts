Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the second integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `count_num` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state are still valid, and the only change is that `count_num` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, and `num` remain the same as in the initial state.
