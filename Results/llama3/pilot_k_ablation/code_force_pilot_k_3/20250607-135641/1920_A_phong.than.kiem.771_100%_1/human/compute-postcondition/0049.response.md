The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not inside a loop, this statement does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the third integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers.
