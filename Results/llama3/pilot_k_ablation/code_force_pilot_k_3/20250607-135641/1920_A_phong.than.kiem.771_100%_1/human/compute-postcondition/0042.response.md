The code increments the value of `count_num` by 1. The initial value of `count_num` is 0. Therefore, the new value of `count_num` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `count_num` is 1. The first integer `i` is within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).**
