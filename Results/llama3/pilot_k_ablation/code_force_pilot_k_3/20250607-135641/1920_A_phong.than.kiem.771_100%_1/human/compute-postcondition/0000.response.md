Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100, start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers t and v**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is between 2 and 100. The second line assigns -1 to `start`. The third line assigns 1000000000 to `end`. The fourth line initializes an empty list `num`. After executing the entire code block, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, and `num` is an empty list. Stdin now contains n inputs, each containing two integers t and v.
