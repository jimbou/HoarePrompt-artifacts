Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains no input, if `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`. If the current value of `t` was 2 and the value of `v` was less than or equal to `end`, then `end` was updated to `v`. Otherwise, no changes were made to `end`.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is now assigned the first integer from the input, and `v` is assigned the second integer from the input. The stdin is now empty since it has been used to accept the input. The conditions related to `t`, `num`, and `end` are still valid, but their values may have changed based on the new values of `t` and `v`.
