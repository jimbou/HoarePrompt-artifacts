Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that includes `v`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is an integer, if `end` is larger than `v`, `end` is set to `v`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `start` and `end`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to include the value of `v`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `t`, `start`, and `end` are still valid.
