Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is equal to `v`, if `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing the value of `v`. If the current value of `t` was 2 and the value of `v` was less than or equal to `end`, then `end` was updated to `v`. Otherwise, no changes were made to `end`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `t`, `num`, and `end` are still valid.
