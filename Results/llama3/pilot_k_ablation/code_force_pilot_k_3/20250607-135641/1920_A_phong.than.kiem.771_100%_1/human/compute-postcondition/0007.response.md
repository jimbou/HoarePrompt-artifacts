Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer, `num` is an empty list, `end` is 1000000000, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v. If the current value of `t` is 1 and the value of `v` is greater than or equal to `start`, `start` is updated to `v`.***
