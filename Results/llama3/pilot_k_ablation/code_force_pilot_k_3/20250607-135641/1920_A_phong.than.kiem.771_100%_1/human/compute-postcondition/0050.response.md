Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the third integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `count_num` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `num` still has at least 3 integers, and `i` is still the third integer in the list. The integers `n`, `t`, `v`, `start`, and `end` retain their original values.
