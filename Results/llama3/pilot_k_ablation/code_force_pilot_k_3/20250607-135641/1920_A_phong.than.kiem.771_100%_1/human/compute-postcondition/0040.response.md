The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the current value of `i` is either less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop will continue to the next iteration without executing the rest of the code inside the loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `count_num` is 0, and the loop moves on to the next iteration.**
