The code reads two integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `t` and `v` are assigned the first and second integers, respectively. The stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v.**
