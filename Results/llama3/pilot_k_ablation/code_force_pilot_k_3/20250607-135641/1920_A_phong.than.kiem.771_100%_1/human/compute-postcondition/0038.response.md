According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If the list `num` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `count_num` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list `num` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the first integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `count_num` is 0**
