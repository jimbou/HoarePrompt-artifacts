The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing the values of `v` (it now contains at least two values of `v`). If `t` is 2, then if `end` > `v`, `end` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, no changes were made to `end`.**
