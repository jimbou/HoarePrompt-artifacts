    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer value 1

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns an integer value based on the input boolean value `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, it prompts the user to input an integer value and returns it, leaving `isOne` as False. If `isOne` is True, it returns the integer value 1.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value, to_int is a boolean value, and stdin contains one input: a string. If space is True, the string is space-separated. If to_int is True, the string contains only space-separated integers.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :

    #State: *`space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string, stdin contains no input. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of strings. If `to_int` is True, the list contains strings that are integers. If `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters. If `to_int` is True, the string contains only space-separated integers.
    if to_int :

        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is True, the list contains integers that were space-separated in the string `line`. If `space` is False, the list contains integers that were individual characters in the string `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of strings if `space` is True, otherwise it returns a list of characters. The list contains the items from the `line` string, split according to the value of `space`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a string input from stdin and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, the function splits the input string into a list of strings or integers (depending on the value of `to_int`) separated by spaces. If `space` is False, the function splits the input string into a list of individual characters or integers (if `to_int` is True). The function then returns the processed list.

    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the string representation of all values in the list `arr` separated by the string `sym`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of values and a separator string as input, converts each value to a string, and returns a single string that contains all the values separated by the specified separator. The function does not modify the original list or separator string.

    indices = []

    #State: indices is a list containing the index of the first occurrence of substring in string, the index of the next occurrence of substring in string, and so on, until the last occurrence of substring in string, index is -1
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of indices containing the index of the first occurrence of substring in string, the index of the next occurrence of substring in string, and so on, until the last occurrence of substring in string. The index starts from -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of indices corresponding to the starting position of each occurrence. If the substring is not found, the function returns an empty list. The function accepts two parameters: the original string and the substring to be searched.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and element is a value of any type.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices of the elements in the list 'arr' that are equal to the value 'element'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. It takes a list and an element as input, and returns a list of indices where the element is found. If the element is not found in the list, an empty list is returned.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of integers, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is an integer.

    #State: The loop iterates over all sub-arrays in `arr`. If a sub-array has an element at `index` equal to `value`, the loop returns that sub-array. If no such sub-array is found after iterating over all sub-arrays, the loop does not return anything.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sub-array in `arr` has an element at `index` equal to `value`, or the loop has iterated over all sub-arrays without finding a match.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches a 2D list of integers for a sub-array containing a specified value at a given index and returns the first matching sub-array, or None if no match is found.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100), then n lines each containing two integers t and v (t in {1,2,3}, 1 <= v <= 10^9).

    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers.

    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the range of start and end (inclusive) and the number of integers in the list 'num' that are within this range, or 0 if start is greater than end.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of integers. It accepts no parameters and returns an integer value. The function reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n followed by n lines of input, each containing two integers t and v. It then processes these inputs to determine the range (start and end) and the list of integers (num). The function counts the number of integers in the list that fall within the specified range and returns the difference between the total numbers in the range and the count of integers in the list, or 0 if the start value exceeds the end value.
