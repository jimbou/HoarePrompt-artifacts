Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem where Alex has n constraints on what the integer k can be. There are three types of constraints: k must be greater than or equal to some integer x, k must be less than or equal to some integer x, and k must be not equal to some integer x. The program needs to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints.

Function 1 (func_1) reads the number of test cases from the input and returns it as an integer. This function is correct as it reads the input and returns the expected value.

Function 2 (func_2) reads a string input from stdin, processes it based on two boolean parameters (space and to_int), and returns the processed list. This function is also correct as it reads the input, processes it according to the parameters, and returns the expected list.

Function 3 (func_3) takes a list of values and a separator string as input, converts each value to a string, and returns a single string that contains all the values separated by the specified separator. This function is correct as it processes the input list and separator string and returns the expected string.

Function 4 (func_4) finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of indices corresponding to the starting position of each occurrence. This function is correct as it finds the occurrences of the substring and returns the expected list of indices.

Function 5 (func_5) finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. This function is correct as it finds the occurrences of the element and returns the expected list of indices.

Function 6 (func_6) searches a 2D list of integers for a sub-array containing a specified value at a given index and returns the first matching sub-array, or None if no match is found. This function is correct as it searches the 2D list and returns the expected sub-array or None.

Function 7 (func_7) calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of integers. This function is correct as it reads the input, processes the range and list of integers, and returns the expected count of integers.

The main program uses Function 1 to read the number of test cases, then uses Function 7 to calculate the number of integers that satisfy all n constraints for each test case. The results are stored in the ans list and printed.

Based on the provided execution summaries, all functions are correct and work together to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
