Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be.
There are three types of constraints:

  1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x ; 
  2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x ; 
  3. k must be not equal to some integer x . 

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is
guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of
type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2 ). Also, it is guaranteed that no
two constraints are the exact same.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 500 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 \leq n \leq
100 ) — the number of constraints.

The following n lines describe the constraints. Each line contains two
integers a and x (a \in \\{1,2,3\\}, \, 1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ). a denotes the
type of constraint. If a=1 , k must be greater than or equal to x . If a=2 , k
must be less than or equal to x . If a=3 , k must be not equal to x .

It is guaranteed that there is a finite amount of integers satisfying all n
constraints (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one
constraint of type 2 ). It is also guaranteed that no two constraints are the
exact same (in other words, all pairs (a, x) are distinct).

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of integers k that
satisfy all n constraints.

Note

In the first test case, k \geq 3 and k \leq 10 . Furthermore, k \neq 1 and k
\neq 5 . The possible integers k that satisfy the constraints are
3,4,6,7,8,9,10 . So the answer is 7 .

In the second test case, k \ge 5 and k \le 4 , which is impossible. So the
answer is 0 .

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: isOne is a boolean value.
    if (not isOne) :
        return int(input())
        #The program returns an integer value that is provided by the user through input, and the value of isOne remains False.
    else :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer value 1

#Overall this is what the function does:The function returns an integer value based on the input boolean value `isOne`. If `isOne` is False, it prompts the user to input an integer value and returns it, leaving `isOne` as False. If `isOne` is True, it returns the integer value 1.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: space is a boolean value, to_int is a boolean value, and stdin contains one input: a string. If space is True, the string is space-separated. If to_int is True, the string contains only space-separated integers.
    line = input()
    if space :
        items = line.split()
    else :
        items = list(line)
    #State: *`space` is a boolean value, `to_int` is a boolean value, `line` is a string, stdin contains no input. If `space` is True, `items` is a list of strings. If `to_int` is True, the list contains strings that are integers. If `space` is False, `items` is a list of characters. If `to_int` is True, the string contains only space-separated integers.
    if to_int :
        return [int(i) for i in items]
        #The program returns a list of integers. If `space` is True, the list contains integers that were space-separated in the string `line`. If `space` is False, the list contains integers that were individual characters in the string `line`.
    else :
        return items
        #The program returns a list of strings if `space` is True, otherwise it returns a list of characters. The list contains the items from the `line` string, split according to the value of `space`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a string input from stdin and processes it based on two boolean parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, the function splits the input string into a list of strings or integers (depending on the value of `to_int`) separated by spaces. If `space` is False, the function splits the input string into a list of individual characters or integers (if `to_int` is True). The function then returns the processed list.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of values that can be converted to strings and sym is a string.
    string = ''
    for i in arr:
        string += str(i) + sym
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of values that can be converted to strings, `sym` is a string, `string` is the string representation of all values in `arr` separated by `sym`, `i` is the last value in the list `arr`.
    return string
    #The program returns a string that is the string representation of all values in the list `arr` separated by the string `sym`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of values and a separator string as input, converts each value to a string, and returns a single string that contains all the values separated by the specified separator. The function does not modify the original list or separator string.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string and substring are strings, substring is not empty
    indices = []
    index = string.find(substring)
    while index != -1:
        indices.append(index)
        
        index = string.find(substring, index + 1)
        
    #State: indices is a list containing the index of the first occurrence of substring in string, the index of the next occurrence of substring in string, and so on, until the last occurrence of substring in string, index is -1
    return indices
    #The program returns a list of indices containing the index of the first occurrence of substring in string, the index of the next occurrence of substring in string, and so on, until the last occurrence of substring in string. The index starts from -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds all occurrences of a given substring within a string and returns a list of indices corresponding to the starting position of each occurrence. If the substring is not found, the function returns an empty list. The function accepts two parameters: the original string and the substring to be searched.

#Function 5:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and element is a value of any type.
    return [index for index, value in enumerate(arr) if value == element]
    #The program returns a list of indices of the elements in the list 'arr' that are equal to the value 'element'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function finds and returns the indices of all occurrences of a specified element within a given list. It takes a list and an element as input, and returns a list of indices where the element is found. If the element is not found in the list, an empty list is returned.

#Function 6:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a 2D list of integers, index is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= index < len(arr[0]), and value is an integer.
    for subArray in arr:
        if subArray[index] == value:
            return subArray
        
    #State: The loop iterates over all sub-arrays in `arr`. If a sub-array has an element at `index` equal to `value`, the loop returns that sub-array. If no such sub-array is found after iterating over all sub-arrays, the loop does not return anything.
    return None
    #The program returns None, indicating that no sub-array in `arr` has an element at `index` equal to `value`, or the loop has iterated over all sub-arrays without finding a match.

#Overall this is what the function does:Searches a 2D list of integers for a sub-array containing a specified value at a given index and returns the first matching sub-array, or None if no match is found.

#Function 7:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n (2 <= n <= 100), then n lines each containing two integers t and v (t in {1,2,3}, 1 <= v <= 10^9).
    n = int(input())

    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []

        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v

    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is `n-1`, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is the last integer in the list, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `num` is a list of integers, `count_num` is the number of integers in `num` that are within the range of `start` and `end` (inclusive).
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the range of start and end (inclusive) and the number of integers in the list 'num' that are within this range, or 0 if start is greater than end.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of integers. It accepts no parameters and returns an integer value. The function reads input from stdin, expecting an integer n followed by n lines of input, each containing two integers t and v. It then processes these inputs to determine the range (start and end) and the list of integers (num). The function counts the number of integers in the list that fall within the specified range and returns the difference between the total numbers in the range and the count of integers in the list, or 0 if the start value exceeds the end value.
