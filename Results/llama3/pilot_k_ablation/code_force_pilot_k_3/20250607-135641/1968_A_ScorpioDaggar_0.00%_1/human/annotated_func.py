#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases, greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000) and then a list of integers (each integer is greater or equal than 2 and less or equal than 1000).
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is `num - 1`
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is equal to num, res is a list containing num integer elements where each element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains empty.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: the elements of the list res, each on a new line, where each element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise an empty list

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a specified number of integers from standard input, calculates the product of the largest factor and the factor minus one for each integer (if the integer is divisible by any number between 2 and itself), and prints the results, one per line. If an integer is not divisible by any number between 2 and itself, it is not included in the output.
