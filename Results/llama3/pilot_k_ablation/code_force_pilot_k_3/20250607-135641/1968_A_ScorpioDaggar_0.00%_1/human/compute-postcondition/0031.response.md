Postcondition: ***num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 4. If L1[i] is divisible by j, res is a list containing num+2 integer elements. Otherwise, res is a list containing num+1 integer elements.***
