According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `num` must be greater than 1.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing two integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is 2**
