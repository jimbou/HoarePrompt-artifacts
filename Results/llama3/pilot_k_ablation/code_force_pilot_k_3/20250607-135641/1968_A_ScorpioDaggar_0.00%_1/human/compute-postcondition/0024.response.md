Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, res is a list containing num+1 integer elements where each element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, stdin contains 0 input, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 2, and the current value of L1[i] is divisible by j (i.e., L1[i] % j == 0).**

The first line appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` (i.e., `L1[i] % j == 0`), the value appended to `res` is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The second line breaks out of the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, this line does not have any effect. No other variables are affected by the code.
