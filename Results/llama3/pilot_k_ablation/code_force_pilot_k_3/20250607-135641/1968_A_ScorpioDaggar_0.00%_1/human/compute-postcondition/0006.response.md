Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing three integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is 2 and the user has been prompted to enter entry no. 3-**

In this output state, the value of `L1` has been updated to include a new integer that was input by the user when prompted to enter entry no. 3-. The value of `i` remains the same, as it was not modified by the code. The other variables, `num` and `res`, also remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as no input was present initially and one input has been consumed by the code.
