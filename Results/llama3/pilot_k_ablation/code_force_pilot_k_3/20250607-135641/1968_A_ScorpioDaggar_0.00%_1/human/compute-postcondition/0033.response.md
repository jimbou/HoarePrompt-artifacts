The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `num`, `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `num`, so `i` must be increased by 1 and `num` must be increased by 1.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is equal to num+1, j is equal to L1[i-1] + 1, res is a list containing num+2 integer elements if L1[i] is not divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num+3 integer elements**
