According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, since it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 1 input: a list of integers, `i` is 0**
