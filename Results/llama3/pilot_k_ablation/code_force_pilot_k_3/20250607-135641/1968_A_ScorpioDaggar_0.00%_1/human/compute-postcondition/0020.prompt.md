Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    if L1[i] % j == 0:
        res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers where L1[i] is at least 2, res is a list containing one integer element which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains empty, stdin contains 0 input, i is a valid index for L1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers where L1[i] is at least 2, i is a valid index for L1, j is at least 3, stdin contains 0 input. If L1[i] is divisible by j, then res is a list containing two integer elements where the first element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) and the second element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1). Otherwise, res remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers where L1[i] is at least 4, i is a valid index for L1, j is at least 4, stdin contains 0 input. If L1[i] is divisible by j, then res is a list containing one integer element which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1). Otherwise, res remains empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
