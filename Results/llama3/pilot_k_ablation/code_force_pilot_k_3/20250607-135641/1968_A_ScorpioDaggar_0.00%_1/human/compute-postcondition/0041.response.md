The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and L1[i]. If j is less than L1[i], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 3 and L1[i] is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1, so j is 4 and for the loop to execute again L1[i] must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **num is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is an integer between 0 and num-1 (inclusive), j is 4, L1[i] is at least 4**
