Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing one integer, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The list `L1` now contains one integer that was input by the user. The list `res` remains empty as it was not modified by the code. The variable `i` also remains unchanged with a value of 0. The stdin is now empty as it has been used to input an integer.
