Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is equal to num, res is a list containing num integer elements where each element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains empty.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `num` remains unchanged, the list `L1` still contains `num` integers, the input stream `stdin` is still empty, and the variable `i` has reached its final value of `num`. The list `res` now contains `num` integer elements, where each element is the result of the calculation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, or remains empty if `L1[i]` is not divisible by any `j`.
