The code snippet consists of two lines: `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` and `break`. 

The first line appends a new element to the `res` list. The value of this new element is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, the division `L1[i] // j` will result in an integer. This integer is then multiplied by `j - 1`, resulting in another integer. This new integer is appended to the `res` list.

The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop it is part of. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, this line does not have any effect.

Considering the initial state and the effects of the code snippet, the final state is:

Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers where L1[i] is at least 2, res is a list containing one integer element which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 input, i is a valid index for L1.**
