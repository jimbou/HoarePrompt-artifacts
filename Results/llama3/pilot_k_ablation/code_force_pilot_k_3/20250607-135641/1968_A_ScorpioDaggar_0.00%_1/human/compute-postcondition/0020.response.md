Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, res is a list containing num integer elements where each element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains empty, stdin contains 0 input, i is equal to num.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `num` remains unchanged, the list `L1` still contains `num` integers, the list `res` now contains `num` integer elements, each of which is the result of the calculation `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains empty. The value of `stdin` remains unchanged as 0, and the value of `i` is now equal to `num`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `L1`.
