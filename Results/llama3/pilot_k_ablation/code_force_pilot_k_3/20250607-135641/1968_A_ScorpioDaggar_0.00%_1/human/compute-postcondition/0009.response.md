To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, which already ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be 0, since the loop starts from 0.

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is 0**
