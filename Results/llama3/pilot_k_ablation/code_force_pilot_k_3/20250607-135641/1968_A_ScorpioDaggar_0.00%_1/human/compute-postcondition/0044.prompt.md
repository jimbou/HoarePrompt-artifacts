Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is equal to num+1, j is equal to L1[i-1] + 1, res is a list containing num+2 integer elements if L1[i] is not divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num+3 integer elements
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    if L1[i] % j == 0:
        res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`num` is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is an integer between 0 and `num-1` (inclusive), `j` is 2, `L1[i]` is at least 2. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list containing `num+4` integer elements. Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `num+2` integer elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is an integer between 0 and num-1 (inclusive), j is 3, L1[i] is at least 3. If L1[i] is divisible by j, then res is a list containing num+5 integer elements and its last element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1). If L1[i] is not divisible by j, then res is a list containing num+3 integer elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *num is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is an integer between 0 and num-1 (inclusive), j is 4, L1[i] is at least 4. If L1[i] is divisible by 4, then res is a list containing one integer which is equal to L1[i] // j * (j - 1).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
