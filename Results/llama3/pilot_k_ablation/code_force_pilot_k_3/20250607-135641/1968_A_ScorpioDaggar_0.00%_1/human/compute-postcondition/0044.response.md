Output State: **num is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is an integer between 0 and num-1 (inclusive), j is equal to L1[i] + 1, res is a list containing num+2 integer elements if L1[i] is not divisible by any integer between 2 and L1[i] (inclusive), otherwise res is a list containing num+3 integer elements.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has checked all possible divisors of L1[i] from 2 to L1[i]. If L1[i] is not divisible by any of these divisors, the loop will not append any new elements to the res list, and it will remain with num+2 integer elements. If L1[i] is divisible by any of these divisors, the loop will append a new element to the res list, which is equal to L1[i] // j * (j - 1), where j is the divisor. In this case, the res list will contain num+3 integer elements.
