To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`. For the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 2, so that the range has at least one element.
2. Since `i` is equal to `num+1`, we know that `L1[i]` is the `(num+1)`-th element of the list `L1`. However, since `L1` only contains `num` integers, `L1[i]` is actually out of bounds. To fix this, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be within the bounds of the list `L1`.
3. Let's assume `i` is adjusted to be within the bounds of `L1`. Then, for the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 2.

Considering these adjustments, the updated state is:

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is an integer between 0 and `num-1` (inclusive), `j` is 2, `res` is a list containing `num+2` integer elements if `L1[i]` is not divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing `num+3` integer elements, `L1[i]` is at least 2**
