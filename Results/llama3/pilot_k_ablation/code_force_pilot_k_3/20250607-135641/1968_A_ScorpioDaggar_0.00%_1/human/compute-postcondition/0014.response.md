The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and L1[i]. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `L1[i]`. If `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 2, `L1[i]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is at least 3 and `L1[i]` remains the same.
State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers where L1[i] is at least 2, res is a list containing one integer element which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains empty, stdin contains 0 input, i is a valid index for L1, j is at least 3**
