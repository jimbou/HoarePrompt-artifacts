Postcondition: ***num is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is an integer between 0 and num-1 (inclusive), j is 4, L1[i] is at least 4. If L1[i] is divisible by 4, then res is a list containing one integer which is equal to L1[i] // j * (j - 1).***
