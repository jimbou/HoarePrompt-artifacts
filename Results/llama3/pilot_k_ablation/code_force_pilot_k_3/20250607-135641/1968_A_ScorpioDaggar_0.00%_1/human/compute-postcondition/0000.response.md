The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `num`. Since stdin contains two inputs, the first input is an integer representing the number of test cases, and the second input is a list of integers. After this line, stdin contains one input: a list of integers. The second line initializes an empty list `L1`. The third line initializes an empty list `res`.

Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is an empty list, res is an empty list, stdin contains 1 input: a list of integers.**
