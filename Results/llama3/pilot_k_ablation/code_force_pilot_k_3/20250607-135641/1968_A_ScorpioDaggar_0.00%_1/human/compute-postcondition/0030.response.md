Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, res is a list containing num+2 integer elements, stdin contains 0 input, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 4**

The code snippet appends a new element to the list `res` and then breaks out of the loop. The new element appended to `res` is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, where `L1[i]` is at least 2 and `j` is 4. This means that the new element is a multiple of 3 (since `j - 1` is 3). As a result, the length of `res` increases by 1, making it a list containing `num+2` integer elements. The value of `i` remains less than `num`, and the values of `num`, `L1`, `stdin`, and `j` remain unchanged.
