Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is an integer between 0 and `num-1` (inclusive), `j` is 2, `L1[i]` is at least 2. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list containing `num+4` integer elements. Otherwise, `res` is a list containing `num+2` integer elements.***
