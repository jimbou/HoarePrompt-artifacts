Postcondition: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is a list containing `num` integer elements where each element is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains empty, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is less than `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is 2, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` (i.e., `L1[i] % j == 0`).**
