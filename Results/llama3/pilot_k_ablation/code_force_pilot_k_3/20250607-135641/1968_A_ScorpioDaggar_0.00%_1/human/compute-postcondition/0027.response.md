Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, res is a list containing num+2 integer elements, stdin contains 0 input, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 3**

The code appends a new element to the `res` list, which is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. Since `L1[i]` is at least 2 and `j` is 3, the new element is a positive integer. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. The `stdin` remains empty, and the values of `num`, `L1`, `i`, and `j` are not modified. The only change is the addition of a new element to the `res` list, making it contain `num+2` integer elements.
