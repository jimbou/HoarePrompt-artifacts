The code prints the elements of the list `res`, each on a new line, where `res` is a list containing `num` integer elements. Each element in `res` is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains empty.

Since `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000, and `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, the elements in `res` will be calculated based on the values in `L1`.

However, without knowing the exact values in `L1`, we cannot determine the exact values in `res`. But we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the elements of the list res, each on a new line, where each element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise an empty list**
