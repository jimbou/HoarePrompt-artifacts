To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(num):`. The objects involved are `i` and `num`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1000.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The value of `num` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing one integer, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is 1**
