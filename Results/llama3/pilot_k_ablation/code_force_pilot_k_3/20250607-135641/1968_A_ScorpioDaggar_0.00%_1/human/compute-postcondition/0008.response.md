Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is `num - 1`**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same `num` value as the initial state, but `L1` will now contain `num` integers, which were input by the user during each iteration of the loop. The `res` list remains empty, and there are no more inputs in `stdin`. The loop variable `i` will have a value of `num - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
