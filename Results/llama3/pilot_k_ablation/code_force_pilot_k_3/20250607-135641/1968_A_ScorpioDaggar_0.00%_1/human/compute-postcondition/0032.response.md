Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is equal to num, j is equal to L1[i-1] + 1, res is a list containing num+1 integer elements if L1[i] is not divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num+2 integer elements.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `num`, and the value of `j` will be equal to `L1[i-1] + 1`. The length of the list `res` will be either `num+1` or `num+2`, depending on whether `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` or not. The other variables, `num`, `L1`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
