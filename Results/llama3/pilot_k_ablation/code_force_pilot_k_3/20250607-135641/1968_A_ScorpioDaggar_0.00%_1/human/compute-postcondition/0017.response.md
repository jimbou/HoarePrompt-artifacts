The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and L1[i], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `L1[i]`. If `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is at least 3, `L1[i]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is at least 4. Also, `L1[i]` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.
State: **num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers where L1[i] is at least 4, i is a valid index for L1, j is at least 4, stdin contains 0 input. If L1[i] is divisible by j, then res is a list containing two integer elements where the first element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) and the second element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1). Otherwise, res remains empty.**
