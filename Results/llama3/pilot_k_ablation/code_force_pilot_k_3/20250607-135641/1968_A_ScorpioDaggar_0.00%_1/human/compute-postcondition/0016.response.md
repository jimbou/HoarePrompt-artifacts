Postcondition: ***num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers where L1[i] is at least 2, i is a valid index for L1, j is at least 3, stdin contains 0 input. If L1[i] is divisible by j, then res is a list containing two integer elements where the first element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1) and the second element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1). Otherwise, res remains empty.***
