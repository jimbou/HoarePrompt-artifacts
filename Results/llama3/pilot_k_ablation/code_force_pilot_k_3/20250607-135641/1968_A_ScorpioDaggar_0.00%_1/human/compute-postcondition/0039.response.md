Output State: **num is an integer greater than 1 and less or equal than 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is an integer between 0 and num-1 (inclusive), j is 3, L1[i] is at least 3, res is a list containing either num+5 or num+3 integer elements, and its last element is L1[i] // j * (j - 1).**

In this output state, the value of `num`, `L1`, `stdin`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `res` is modified by appending a new element, which is the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The length of `res` is either `num+5` or `num+3`, depending on whether `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables.
