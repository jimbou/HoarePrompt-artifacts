Output State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing two integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is 1**

The code appends an integer input by the user to the list `L1`. Since `stdin` contains 0 input, the user is prompted to enter an integer. The integer is appended to `L1`, which now contains two integers. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
