Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is a list containing `num` integer elements where each element is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains empty, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is equal to `num + 1`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    if L1[i] % j == 0:
        res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, res is a list containing num+1 integer elements if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains the same, stdin contains 0 input, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, res is a list containing num+1 integer elements if L1[i] is not divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num+2 integer elements, stdin contains 0 input, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *num is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 input, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 4. If L1[i] is divisible by j, res is a list containing num+2 integer elements. Otherwise, res is a list containing num+1 integer elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
