Output State: `num` is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is `num - 1`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `num` remains unchanged, `L1` will contain `num` integers that were input by the user, `res` remains an empty list, there are no more inputs in `stdin`, and the loop counter `i` will be one less than the value of `num`.
