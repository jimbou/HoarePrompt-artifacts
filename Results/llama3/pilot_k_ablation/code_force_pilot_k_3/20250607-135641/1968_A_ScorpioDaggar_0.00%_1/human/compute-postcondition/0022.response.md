To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop iterates over a range starting from 2 to `L1[i] + 1`. For the loop to execute, `L1[i]` must be at least 2, because the range starts from 2.
2. Since `i` is equal to `num + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be within the bounds of the list `L1`. This means `i` should be less than `num`, so that `L1[i]` is a valid index.
3. The state of `L1` is already defined as a list containing `num` integers, so we don't need to adjust it further.
4. The states of `num`, `res`, and `stdin` are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0 and less or equal than 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers, `res` is a list containing `num` integer elements where each element is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains empty, `stdin` contains 0 input, `i` is less than `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is 2**
