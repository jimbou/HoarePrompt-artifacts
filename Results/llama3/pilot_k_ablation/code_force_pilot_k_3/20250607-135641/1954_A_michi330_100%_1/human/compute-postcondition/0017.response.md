To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for itest in range(0, t, 1):`.

The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `itest`. According to the code, `itest` is incremented by 1 in each iteration. At the end of the previous iteration, `itest` is 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `itest` should be 2.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers and are assigned values from the input, stdin contains no input.**
