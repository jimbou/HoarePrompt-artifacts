Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)
Code of the loop:
for itest in range(0, t, 1):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    if n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('Yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is larger than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is larger than `k`, then 'Yes' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 1, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers and are assigned values from the input, stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers and are assigned values from the input, stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
