The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of `t` to be the integer accepted from the input. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` (1 <= m, k <= n <= 50)**
