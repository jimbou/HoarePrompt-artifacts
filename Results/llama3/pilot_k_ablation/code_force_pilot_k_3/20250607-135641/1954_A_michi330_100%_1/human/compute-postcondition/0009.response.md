Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, or the difference between `n` and the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is larger than `k` and `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is larger than `k`, then 'Yes' is printed.***
