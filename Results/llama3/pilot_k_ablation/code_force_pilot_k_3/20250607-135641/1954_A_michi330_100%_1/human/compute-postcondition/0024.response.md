Output State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is `t-1`, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers and are assigned values from the input, stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `itest` will be one less than the initial value of `t`, and the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will be the last set of values read from the input. The loop will have printed either 'NO' or 'Yes' for each iteration, depending on the conditions specified in the loop body. The input will be exhausted, and stdin will contain no more input.
