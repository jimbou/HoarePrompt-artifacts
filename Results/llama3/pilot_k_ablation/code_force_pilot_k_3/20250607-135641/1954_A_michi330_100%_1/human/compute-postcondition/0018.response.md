Output State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers and are assigned values from the input, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned integer values from the input, but since stdin contains no input, these variables are not actually assigned any values. The state of stdin remains the same, containing no input.
