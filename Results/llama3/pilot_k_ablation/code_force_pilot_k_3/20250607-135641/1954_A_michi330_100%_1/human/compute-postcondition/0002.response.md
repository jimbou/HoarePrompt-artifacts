Output State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `itest` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` to integers from the input, which is a space-separated list of integers. Since the input is consumed, the stdin is now empty.
