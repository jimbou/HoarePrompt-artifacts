Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 2, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers and are assigned values from the input, stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to `k` or `n` minus the ceiling of `n` divided by `m` is less than or equal to `k`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed.***
