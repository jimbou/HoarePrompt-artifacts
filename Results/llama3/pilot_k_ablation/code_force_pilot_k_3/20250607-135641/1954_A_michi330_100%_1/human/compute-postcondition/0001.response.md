To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `itest` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 1000), so we can adjust `t` to be at least 1 and `itest` to be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, `itest` is 0**
