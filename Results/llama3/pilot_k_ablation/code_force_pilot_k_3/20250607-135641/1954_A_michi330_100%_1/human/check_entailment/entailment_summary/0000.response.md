Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`.
3. The program then checks two conditions:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, so Alice cannot prevent him from making all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'NO'.
   - If `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, it means that even if Alice paints the ribbon with `m` colors, Bob can still repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program also prints 'NO'.
4. If neither of the above conditions is true, it means that Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. In this case, the program prints 'Yes'.

The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and the execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior.

Correctness: **True**
