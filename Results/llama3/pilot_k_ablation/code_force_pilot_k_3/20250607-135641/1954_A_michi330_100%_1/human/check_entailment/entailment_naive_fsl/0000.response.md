Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether Alice can paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color.

The key insight is that if the number of parts (n) is less than or equal to the number of parts Bob can repaint (k), or if the number of parts minus the ceiling of the number of parts divided by the number of colors (m) is less than or equal to k, then Bob can always make all parts have the same color.

The program correctly checks these conditions and prints "NO" if either of them is true. Otherwise, it prints "YES", indicating that Alice can paint the ribbon in a way that prevents Bob from making all parts have the same color.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where n, m, or k is 1. The use of the `math.ceil` function ensures that the program correctly handles cases where n is not exactly divisible by m.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem.
