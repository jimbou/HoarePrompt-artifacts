Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, which consists of an integer `t` followed by `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`.

2. The program then iterates over each test case using a for loop, which is correct.

3. Inside the loop, the program checks the condition `n <= k or n - math.ceil(n / m) <= k`. This condition is correct based on the problem description. If `n` is less than or equal to `k`, it means Bob can repaint all parts of the ribbon, so Alice cannot paint the ribbon in such a way that Bob cannot make all parts have the same color. If `n - math.ceil(n / m)` is less than or equal to `k`, it means Bob can repaint at most `k` parts to make all parts have the same color.

4. If the condition is true, the program prints 'NO', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. This is correct based on the problem description.

5. The program processes multiple test cases as specified by the initial input integer `t`, and it consumes all input from standard input, leaving it empty after execution.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
