The `print(n, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `n`, which is an integer, followed by a space.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `n`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `n` followed by a space.

Output: **[n] (where n is an integer)**
