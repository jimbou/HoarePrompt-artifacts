Based on the initial state, we know that `n` is an integer, and its value is printed followed by a space, and then the value of `n` is printed again.

The print statement `print(n - 1)` will print the value of `n` minus 1.

Since `n` is an integer, subtracting 1 from it will result in another integer.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n` minus 1.

Output: **n-1 (where n is an integer)**
