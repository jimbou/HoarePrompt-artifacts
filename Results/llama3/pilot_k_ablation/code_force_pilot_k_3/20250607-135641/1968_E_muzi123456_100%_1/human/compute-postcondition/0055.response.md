To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, the condition `i < n - 1` still holds true if `n` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, and the value of `n` which is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive is printed followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed, and 1 is printed, and 1 is printed**
