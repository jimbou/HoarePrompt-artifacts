Output: **t is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer, and the value of n which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive is printed, and this is printed: "[n] " (where [n] is the value of n), and n - 1 is printed (where n - 1 is the value of n minus 1). If n is equal to 3, then 2 is printed, and 1 is printed. If n is not equal to 3, then the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed, and the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed again, and a space is printed**
