Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer.**

The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, making it an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, making it an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. Since `t` lines are left in stdin, each containing a single integer, the state of stdin is updated accordingly.
