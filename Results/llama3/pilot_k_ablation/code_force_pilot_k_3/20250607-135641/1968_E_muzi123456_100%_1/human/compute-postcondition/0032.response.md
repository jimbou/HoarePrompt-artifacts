Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer, and the value of n which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive is printed, and this is printed: "[n] " (where [n] is the value of n), and n - 1 is printed (where n - 1 is the value of n minus 1), and n is not equal to 3, and the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed, and the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed again.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: The initial state remains unchanged, and the loop has printed all integers from 1 to n-2, and then printed them again.
