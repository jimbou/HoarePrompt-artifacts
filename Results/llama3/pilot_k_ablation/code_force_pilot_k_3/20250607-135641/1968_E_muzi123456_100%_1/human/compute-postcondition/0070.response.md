According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive. For the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 48 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer.**
