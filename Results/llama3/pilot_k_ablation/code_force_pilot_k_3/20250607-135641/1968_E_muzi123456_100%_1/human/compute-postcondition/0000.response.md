The code `t = int(input())` accepts an input and converts it to an integer. The stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 50) first and that integer is assigned into t. So stdin now contains t lines each containing a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3). The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3)**
