Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, and the value of `n` which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive is printed followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed, and all integers from 1 to `n - 1` are printed, and all integers from 1 to `n - 1` are printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, printing the value of `n` followed by a space, then `n - 1`, and then all integers from 1 to `n - 1` twice. The value of `i` is now `n - 1`, indicating that the loop has completed its last iteration. The state of `t` and the contents of stdin remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
