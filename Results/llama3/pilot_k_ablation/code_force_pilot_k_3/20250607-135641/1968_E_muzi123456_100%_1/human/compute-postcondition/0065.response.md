Output State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, and the value of `n` which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive is printed followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed, and all integers from 1 to `n - 1` are printed, and all integers from 1 to `n - 1` are printed.

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n - 1`, and all integers from 1 to `n - 1` will be printed twice. The state of `t` and `n` remains unchanged, and the contents of stdin also remain unchanged.
