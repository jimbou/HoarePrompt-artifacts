The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 49 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer, and the value of n which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive is printed, and this is printed: "[n] " (where [n] is the value of n), and n - 1 is printed (where n - 1 is the value of n minus 1). If n is equal to 3, then 2 is printed, and 1 is printed. If n is not equal to 3, then the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed, and the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed again, and a space is printed**
