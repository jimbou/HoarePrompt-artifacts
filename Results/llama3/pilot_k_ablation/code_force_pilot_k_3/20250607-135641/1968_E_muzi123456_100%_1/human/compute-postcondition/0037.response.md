Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, which means `t` will be an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which means `n` will be an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The stdin will contain `t` lines each containing a single integer. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid after the code execution.
