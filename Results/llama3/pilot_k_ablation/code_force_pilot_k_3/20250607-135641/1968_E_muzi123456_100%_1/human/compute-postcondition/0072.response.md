Based on the precondition, we know that `t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, and `n` is an integer. The `print` statement is executed with the argument `n` and the `end` parameter set to `' '`, which means that a space character will be printed after the value of `n`.

Since `n` is an integer, its value will be printed as a decimal number. The exact value of `n` is not specified in the precondition, so we cannot determine its exact value.

The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that a space character will be printed after the value of `n`. This is used to separate the output of `n` from any subsequent output.

Therefore, the output of the `print` statement will be the value of `n` followed by a space character.

Output: **[n] (where n is an integer) **
