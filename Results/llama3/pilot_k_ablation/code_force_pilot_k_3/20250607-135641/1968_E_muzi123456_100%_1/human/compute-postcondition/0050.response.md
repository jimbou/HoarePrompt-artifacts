To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, and the value of `n` which is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive is printed followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed**
