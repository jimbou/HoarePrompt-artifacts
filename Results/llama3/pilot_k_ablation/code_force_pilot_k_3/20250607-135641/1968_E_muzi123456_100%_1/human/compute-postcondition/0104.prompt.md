Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^3)
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    print(n, end=' ')
    print(n)
    print(n, end=' ')
    print(n - 1)
    if n == 3:
        print(2, end=' ')
        print(1)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            print(i, end=' ')
            print(i)
    print(' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer, and the value of n which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive is printed, and this is printed: "[n] " (where [n] is the value of n), and n - 1 is printed (where n - 1 is the value of n minus 1). If n is equal to 3, then 2 is printed, and 1 is printed. If n is not equal to 3, then the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed, and the values of all integers from 1 to n - 2 are printed again, and a space is printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, n is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing a single integer. If n is 3, the value of n is printed followed by a space, n - 1 is printed, 2 is printed followed by a space, and 1 is printed. If n is not 3, the value of n is printed followed by a space, n - 1 is printed, and all integers from 1 to n - 1 are printed twice, and a space is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, n is an integer, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing a single integer, and the value of n-1 is being printed. If n is 3, then 2 and 1 are printed. If n is greater than or equal to 4, then 1, n-2, n-2, n-3, 3, n-2, and n-2 are printed, and a space is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
