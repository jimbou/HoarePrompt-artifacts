The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 48 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive, `i` is 3, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, and the value of `n` which is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 10^3 inclusive is printed followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed, and 1 is printed, and 1 is printed, and 2 is printed, and `i` which is 3 is printed**
