The first line decrements `t` by 1, so `t` becomes an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, after reading one line, stdin will contain `t-1` lines each containing a single integer.

Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, n is an integer, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing a single integer.**
