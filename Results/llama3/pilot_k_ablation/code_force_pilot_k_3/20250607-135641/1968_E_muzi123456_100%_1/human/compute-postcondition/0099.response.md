Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing a single integer, the value of n-1 is being printed, `i` is n-2, and this is printed: 1, and 1 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed, and 3 is printed, and the value of `i` which is n-2 is printed, and n-2 is printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains an integer between 0 and 47 inclusive, `n` is an integer that is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing a single integer, the value of n-1 is being printed, and `i` is n-2. The loop has printed the numbers 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, and so on up to n-2, n-2.
