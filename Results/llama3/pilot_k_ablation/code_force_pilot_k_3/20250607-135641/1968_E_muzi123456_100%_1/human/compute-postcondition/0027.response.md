The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 4, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, `i` is 3, the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed**
