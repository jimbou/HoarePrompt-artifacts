Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers to process. For each integer n, it prints the value of n twice, followed by the values from 1 to n-1 (inclusive) printed twice, except for the case where n is 3, in which it prints 2 and 1. After processing all integers, the function leaves the standard input empty and the value of t as 0.**
