Based on the initial state, we know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The `print` statement is executed with `n` as its argument, and the `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that a space character will be printed after the value of `n`.

Since `n` is an integer, its value will be printed as a decimal number. The exact value of `n` is not specified, but we know it falls within the range of 2 to 10^3 (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n` followed by a space character.

Output: **[n] ** (where [n] is the value of n, an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive)
