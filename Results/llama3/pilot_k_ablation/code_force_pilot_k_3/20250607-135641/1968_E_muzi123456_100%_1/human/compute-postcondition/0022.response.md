To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than `i + 1`, so `n` must be greater than 3.

The other states, such as `t`, `stdin`, and the printed values, are not relevant to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 3, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, `i` is 2**
