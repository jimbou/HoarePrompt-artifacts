According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, and the value of `n` which is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive is printed, and this is printed: "[n] " (where [n] is the value of `n`), and `n - 1` is printed (where `n - 1` is the value of `n` minus 1), and `n` is not equal to 3. So for the loop to be executed `n` must be greater than 3 and `i` is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 49 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 inclusive, stdin contains `t` lines each containing a single integer, and the value of `n` which is an integer between 4 and 10^3 inclusive is printed, and this is printed: "[n] " (where [n] is the value of `n`), and `n - 1` is printed (where `n - 1` is the value of `n` minus 1), and `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is 1**
