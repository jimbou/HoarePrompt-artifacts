Based on the precondition, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive. The `print` statement is `print(n - 1)`. This means that the value of `n` will be decremented by 1 and the result will be printed.

Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 inclusive, the value of `n - 1` will be an integer between 1 and 10^3 - 1 inclusive.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `n - 1`, which is an integer between 1 and 10^3 - 1 inclusive.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 999 inclusive**
