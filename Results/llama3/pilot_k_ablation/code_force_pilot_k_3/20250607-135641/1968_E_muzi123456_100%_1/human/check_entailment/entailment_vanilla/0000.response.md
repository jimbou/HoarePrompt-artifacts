Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of n points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The points are chosen such that they form a diagonal line from the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner of the grid.

The program handles the case where n is 3 separately, as this is a special case where the optimal arrangement is different from the general case.

For n greater than 3, the program prints the coordinates of the points in a loop, starting from the top-right corner and moving diagonally down to the bottom-left corner.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the optimal arrangement of points for each test case.

However, there is a small issue with the program. In the last line of the program, it prints a single space character (' '). This is not necessary and can be removed.

Correctness: **True**
