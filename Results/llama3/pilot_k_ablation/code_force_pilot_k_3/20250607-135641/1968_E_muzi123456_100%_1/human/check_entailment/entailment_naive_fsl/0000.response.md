Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program prints:

4 4
4 3
1 1
1 2

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of \mathcal{H}. A correct arrangement for n = 4 would be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

This arrangement has a larger size of \mathcal{H} than the one produced by the program.

The program's logic is incorrect because it does not properly handle the case when n is even. It simply prints the same coordinates for the first two points, which does not maximize the size of \mathcal{H}. A correct solution would need to handle the even and odd cases separately and print the correct coordinates for each case.
