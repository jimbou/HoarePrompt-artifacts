Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of subsequent integers to process. For each integer n, it prints the value of n twice, followed by the values from 1 to n-1 (inclusive) printed twice, except for the case where n is 3, in which it prints 2 and 1.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances can be achieved by placing cells in a specific pattern. The pattern involves placing cells at positions (n, n), (n, n-1), and then at positions (i, i) for i ranging from 1 to n-1. This pattern ensures that the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells are distinct, thus maximizing the size of the set.

The program correctly implements this pattern for all values of n, including the special case where n is 3. The execution summary confirms that the program produces the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
