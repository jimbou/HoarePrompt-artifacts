Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the largest value `m` such that there exists a sequence `c_1, ..., c_{k-1}` such that `1 <= c_1 < ... < c_{k-1} < n` and `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m`. If no such `m` exists, it correctly outputs `-1`.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest possible value of `m`. It first finds the maximum value `max_val` such that `func_1(1, max_val * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. Then, it iterates over all possible values of `i` from `n // k` to `1` and checks if `i * max_val` is a valid value for `m`. If it is, it calls `func_2(m)` to output the answer and returns. If no valid value of `m` is found, it calls `func_2(-1)` to output `-1`.

The program also correctly handles the interaction with the judge by printing the queries and answers in the required format and flushing the output after each print statement.

Correctness: **True**
