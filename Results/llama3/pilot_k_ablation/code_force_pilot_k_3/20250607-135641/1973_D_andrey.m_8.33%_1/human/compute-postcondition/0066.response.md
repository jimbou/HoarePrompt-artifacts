Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is the same as the return value of `func_1(p + 1, i * max_val)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until `j` reaches `k`. At each iteration, `p` will be updated to the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, where `m` is `i * max_val`. If `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will break. Otherwise, the loop will continue until `j` reaches `k`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `r` remain unchanged throughout the loop.
