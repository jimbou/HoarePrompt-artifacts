To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n-1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-2`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.

The states of `max_val`, `r`, and `stdin` are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or n-1, `i` is n-2, `r` is the return value of func_1(1, i * n) and is either less than or equal to n or greater than n, stdin contains no input.**
