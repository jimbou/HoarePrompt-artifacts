The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is 3. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
