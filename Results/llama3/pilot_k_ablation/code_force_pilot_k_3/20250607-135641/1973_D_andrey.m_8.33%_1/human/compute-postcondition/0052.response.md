Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is greater than or equal to 1, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) <= n, r is the return value of func_1(1, 0 * n) and is either less than or equal to n or greater than n, m is i * max_val, j is k, p is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `m` is updated to `i * max_val`, which is a new value based on the initial values of `i` and `max_val`. The value of `p` is reset to 0. The value of `j` remains the same as `k`.
