Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or n-1, `i` is n-2, `r` is the return value of func_1(1, (n-2) * n) and is either less than or equal to n or greater than n, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is updated to be the return value of the function `func_1` called with arguments 1 and `(n-2) * n`. The return value of `func_1` is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`. The stdin still contains no input.
