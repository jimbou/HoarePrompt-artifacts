The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1. So, `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `j` is `k`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**
