Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, 0)`, `j` is 2.**

The value of `p` has been updated to be the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, where `m` is 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
