Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, and the return value of `func_2(-1)` has been returned.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but the function `func_2(-1)` has been executed and its return value has been returned. The function call does not affect the values of any variables, so they retain their initial values.
