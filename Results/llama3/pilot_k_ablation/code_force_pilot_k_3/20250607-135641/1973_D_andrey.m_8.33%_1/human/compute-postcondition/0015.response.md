To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n // k` is greater than 0. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers and `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, we can infer that `n // k` will be at least 1 if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, since `i` is initialized to `n // k`, we can set `i` to be greater than or equal to 1.

The other variables, `max_val`, `r`, and `stdin`, are not relevant to the loop execution and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) <= n, `r` is the return value of func_1(1, 0 * n) and is either less than or equal to n or greater than n, stdin contains no input**
