Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, with `j` reaching its final value of `k`. The value of `p` is the result of the last iteration of the loop, which is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
