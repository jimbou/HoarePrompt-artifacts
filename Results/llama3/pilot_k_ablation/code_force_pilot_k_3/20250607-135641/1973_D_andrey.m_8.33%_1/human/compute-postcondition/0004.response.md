Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, `_` is 1, and a function `func_3()` has been called and executed.**

The code simply calls the function `func_3()`, which has already been called according to the initial state. Since the function has already been called, its execution does not change the state of the variables. The values of `t`, `_`, and the emptiness of stdin remain the same. The function `func_3()` has been executed, but its effects on the state are not specified, so we can only confirm that it has been called and executed.
