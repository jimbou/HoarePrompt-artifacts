The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the input to the variable `t`. The input is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), so `t` is assigned a value within this range. The stdin contains one input: a positive integer, but since this input is consumed by the `input()` function, the stdin is now empty.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty**
