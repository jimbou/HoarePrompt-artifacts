Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is the same as the return value of `func_1(p + 1, i * max_val)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
