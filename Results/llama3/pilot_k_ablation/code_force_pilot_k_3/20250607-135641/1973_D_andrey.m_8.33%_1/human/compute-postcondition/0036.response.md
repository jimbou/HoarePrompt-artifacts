Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is greater than or equal to 0, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) <= n, r is the return value of func_1(1, 0 * n) and is either less than or equal to n or greater than n, m is 0, p is 0, j is k.**

The code modifies the values of `m` and `p`. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`, but since `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n) <= n`, and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the value of `m` becomes 0. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `p`. No other variables are affected.
