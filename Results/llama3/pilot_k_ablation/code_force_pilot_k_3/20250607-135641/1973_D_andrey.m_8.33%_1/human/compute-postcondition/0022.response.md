The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `j` is 2**
