To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, `_` is 1, and a function `func_3()` has been called.**
