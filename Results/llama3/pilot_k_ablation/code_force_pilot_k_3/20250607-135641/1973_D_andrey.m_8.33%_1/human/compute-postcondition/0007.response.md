Output State: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, `_` is `t-1`, and a function `func_3()` has been called and executed `t` times.

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (it's still a positive integer between 1 and 10^3), the standard input (stdin) is still empty, the loop variable `_` has reached a value of `t-1` (since it started at 0 and incremented `t` times), and the function `func_3()` has been called and executed a total of `t` times.
