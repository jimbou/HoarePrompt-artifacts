Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, max_val is either 0 or the largest integer i such that func_1(1, i * n) <= n, i is 0, r is the return value of func_1(1, 0 * n) and is either less than or equal to n or greater than n, stdin contains no input.**

This output state indicates that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The value of `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` is less than or equal to `n`. The value of `i` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished iterating. The value of `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, which can be either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`. The state of `n`, `k`, and `stdin` remains unchanged.
