Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and is greater than or equal to `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on these variables are still valid.
