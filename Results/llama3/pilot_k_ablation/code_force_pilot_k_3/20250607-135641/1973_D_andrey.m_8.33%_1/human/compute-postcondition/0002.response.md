Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, `_` is 0, and a function `func_3()` has been called.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and stdin is still empty. The only change is that the function `func_3()` has been called, but since its implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state.
