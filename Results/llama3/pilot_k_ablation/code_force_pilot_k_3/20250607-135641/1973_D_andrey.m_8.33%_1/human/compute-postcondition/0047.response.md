Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is 3, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `r`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is updated to be the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, which depends on the definition of `func_1`. If the new value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.
