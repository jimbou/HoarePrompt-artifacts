Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, `_` is `t-1`, and a function `func_3()` has been called and executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged (as it is not modified within the loop), the standard input (`stdin`) remains empty (as no input operations are performed within the loop), the loop variable `_` will have taken on the value of `t-1` (since it increments from 0 up to but not including `t`), and the function `func_3()` will have been called and executed `t` times.
