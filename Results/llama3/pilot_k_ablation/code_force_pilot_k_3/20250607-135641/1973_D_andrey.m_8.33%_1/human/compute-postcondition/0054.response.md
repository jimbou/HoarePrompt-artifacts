Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

The value of `p` is updated to be the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `p` is now dependent on the value of `m`, which is `i * max_val`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `r`, `m`, and `j` are still the same as in the initial state.
