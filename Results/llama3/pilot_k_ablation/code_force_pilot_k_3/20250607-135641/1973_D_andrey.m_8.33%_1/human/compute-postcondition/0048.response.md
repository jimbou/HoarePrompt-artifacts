Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is 3, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and conditions, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
