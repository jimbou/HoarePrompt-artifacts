Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, `max_val` is either 0 or n-1, `i` is n-2, `r` is the return value of func_1(1, (n-2) * n) and is either less than or equal to n or greater than n, stdin contains no input. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is set to `n-2`.***
