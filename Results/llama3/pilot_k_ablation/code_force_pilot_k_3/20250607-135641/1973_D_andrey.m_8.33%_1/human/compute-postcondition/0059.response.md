Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 2, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`**

The code updates the value of `p` by calling the function `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. The return value of this function call is assigned back to `p`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `p`, which is now the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
