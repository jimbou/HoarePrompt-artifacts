Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` and is greater than or equal to `n`, `j` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of the loop or if statement.
