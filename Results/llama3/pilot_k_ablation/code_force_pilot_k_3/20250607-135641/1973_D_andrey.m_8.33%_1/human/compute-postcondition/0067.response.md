Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `n`, `k`, `max_val`, and `r` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The value of `m` is 0, and `j` is still `k`. The value of `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, which can be either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`.
