To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. Here, `_` is the loop variable, and `t` is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration:

* `_` is 2 (incremented by 1)
* `t` must be greater than 2 (since `_` is now 2)

The other variables, `stdin` and `func_3()`, are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `stdin` is empty, `_` is 2, and a function `func_3()` has been called and executed.**
