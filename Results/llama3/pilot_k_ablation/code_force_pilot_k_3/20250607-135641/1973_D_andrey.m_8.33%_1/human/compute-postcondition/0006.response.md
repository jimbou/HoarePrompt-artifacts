Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, a function `func_3()` has been called and executed, and a value has been returned.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 2. The value of `_` also remains unchanged as 2. Since the function `func_3()` has been called and executed, a value has been returned, but the specific value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only conclude that a value has been returned, without knowing its exact value.
