Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_val` is either 0 or the largest integer `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` <= `n`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, 0 * n)` and is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `m` is `i` times `max_val`, `p` is the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either less than or equal to `n` or greater than `n`, `j` is `k`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the variables not affected by the loop head and body (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `r`, and `m`) remain unchanged. The variable `p` is updated to be the return value of `func_1(p + 1, m)` after the last iteration, and `j` is equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
