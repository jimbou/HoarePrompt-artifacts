#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list a of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, a = case
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
            median_index += 1
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value for each test case, `case` is the last test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the last test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the last test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements in a list that are equal to the median value for each test case. The list is empty except for the last test case, which has a list 'a' with at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in 'a'. The median value is the middle value of the sorted list 'a', and the number of elements equal to the median value is stored in the variable 'operations'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of elements equal to the median value in each test case and returns a list of these counts. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer n and a list a of n integers. The function sorts each list a in ascending order, finds the median value, and then counts the number of elements equal to the median value. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.
