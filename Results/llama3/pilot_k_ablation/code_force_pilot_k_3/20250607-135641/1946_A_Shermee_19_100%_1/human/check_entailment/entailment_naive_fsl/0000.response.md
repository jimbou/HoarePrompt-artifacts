Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program sorts the array in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
2. It calculates the median index using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`, which is correct for both even and odd-length arrays.
3. It finds the median value by accessing the element at the median index.
4. It initializes a counter `operations` to 0, which will keep track of the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.
5. It enters a while loop that continues as long as the median index is within the bounds of the array and the element at the median index is equal to the median value. This loop effectively counts the number of elements that are equal to the median value.
6. Inside the loop, it increments the median index and the `operations` counter.
7. Once the loop exits, it appends the `operations` value to the `results` list.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. For example:

* If the array has an odd length, the median is the middle element, and the program correctly counts the number of elements equal to the median value.
* If the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle elements, but the program still correctly counts the number of elements equal to the median value.
* If the array contains duplicate elements, the program correctly counts the number of elements equal to the median value.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
