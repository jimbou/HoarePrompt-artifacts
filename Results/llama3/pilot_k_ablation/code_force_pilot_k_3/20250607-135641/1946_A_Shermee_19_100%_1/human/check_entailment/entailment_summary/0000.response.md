Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Here's why:

1. The program sorts the array in ascending order, which is necessary to find the median.
2. It finds the median index and value correctly using the formula `(n - 1) // 2`, where `n` is the length of the array.
3. It then counts the number of elements equal to the median value by iterating from the median index to the end of the array. This is correct because all elements equal to the median value must be incremented to increase the median.
4. The program returns a list of these counts, one for each test case, which is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

The execution summary also confirms that the function calculates the number of elements equal to the median value in each test case and returns a list of these counts.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
