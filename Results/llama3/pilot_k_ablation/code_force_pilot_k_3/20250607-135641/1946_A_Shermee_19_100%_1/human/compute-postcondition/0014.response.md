Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the second test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than the median value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `median_index` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `operations` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
