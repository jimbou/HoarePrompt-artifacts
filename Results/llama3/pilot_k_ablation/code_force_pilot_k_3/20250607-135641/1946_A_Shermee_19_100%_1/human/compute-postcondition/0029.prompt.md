Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, and has one more element which is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than the median value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value.
Code of the loop:
while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
    median_index += 1
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, and has one more element which is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is equal to its original value plus 1, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to its original value plus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, and has one more element which is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than its current value, a is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is equal to its original value plus 2, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to its original value plus 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, and has one more element which is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than its current value plus 1, a is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is equal to its original value plus 3, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to its original value plus 3


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
