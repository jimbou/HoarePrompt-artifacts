Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the second test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than the median value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is 0.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `case`, `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median_value`, or `operations`. The `sort()` method is called on `a`, but since `a` is already sorted in ascending order, this does not change its value. The `median_index` and `median_value` are calculated based on the sorted `a`, but these values are not modified by the code. The `operations` variable is initialized to 0 and not modified.
