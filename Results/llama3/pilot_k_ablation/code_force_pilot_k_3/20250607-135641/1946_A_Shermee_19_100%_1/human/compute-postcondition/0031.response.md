Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value for each test case, `case` is the last test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the last test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the last test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the `test_cases` list will be empty because all test cases have been processed. The `results` list will contain the number of elements equal to the median value for each test case. The `case` variable will hold the last test case that was processed, and `n`, `a`, `median_index`, `median_value`, and `operations` will have the same values as in the last iteration of the loop.
