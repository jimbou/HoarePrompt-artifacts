Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the first test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than the median value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 3 times, with the only difference being the value of median_index and operations. The loop will continue to execute as long as median_index is less than n and a[median_index] is equal to median_value. Once median_index reaches the index of the first element in a that is greater than the median value, the loop will terminate. The value of operations will be equal to the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value.
