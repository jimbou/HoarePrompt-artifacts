Output State: **The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements in a list that are equal to the median value for each test case. The list is empty except for the last test case, which has a list 'a' with at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in 'a'. The median value is the middle value of the sorted list 'a', and the number of elements equal to the median value is stored in the variable 'operations'.**
