You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list a of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, a = case
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
            median_index += 1
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: `test_cases` is an empty list, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value for each test case, `case` is the last test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the last test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the last test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements in a list that are equal to the median value for each test case. The list is empty except for the last test case, which has a list 'a' with at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in 'a'. The median value is the middle value of the sorted list 'a', and the number of elements equal to the median value is stored in the variable 'operations'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers where each integer represents the number of elements in a list that are equal to the median value for each test case. The list is empty except for the last test case, which has a list 'a' with at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in 'a'. The median value is the middle value of the sorted list 'a', and the number of elements equal to the median value is stored in the variable 'operations'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
