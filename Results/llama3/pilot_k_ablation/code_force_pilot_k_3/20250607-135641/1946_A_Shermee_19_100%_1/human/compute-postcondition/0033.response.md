Functionality: **This function calculates the number of elements equal to the median value in each test case and returns a list of these counts. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer n and a list a of n integers. The function sorts each list a in ascending order, finds the median value, and then counts the number of elements equal to the median value. The function returns a list of these counts, one for each test case.**
