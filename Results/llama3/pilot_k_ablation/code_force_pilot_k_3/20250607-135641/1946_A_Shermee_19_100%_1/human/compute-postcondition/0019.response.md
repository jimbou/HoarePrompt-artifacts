Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the second test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than the median value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except that the median_index has been incremented by the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, and the operations variable has been incremented by the same amount. This means that the loop has iterated over all the elements in a that are equal to the median value, and has stopped at the first element that is greater than the median value.
