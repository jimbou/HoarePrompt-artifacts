Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than or equal to median_index plus 2, a is the second element of the second test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the current median_index that is equal to median_value, median_index is equal to its original value plus 2, median_value is the median value of a, operations is 3**

The code increments `median_index` by 1 and `operations` by 1. The initial state of `median_index` is its original value plus 1, so after the code executes, `median_index` becomes its original value plus 2. The initial state of `operations` is 2, so after the code executes, `operations` becomes 3. No other variables are affected by the code.
