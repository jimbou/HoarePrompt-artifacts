Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value, and has two more elements which are the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value, `case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `results` now contains one more element, which is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value. All other variables remain unchanged, with `test_cases` still having at least 3 test cases, `case` still being the third test case, `n` still being the first element of the third test case and greater than or equal to 2, `a` still being the second element of the third test case and sorted in ascending order, `median_index` still being equal to `n`, `median_value` still being the median value of `a`, and `operations` still being equal to the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.
