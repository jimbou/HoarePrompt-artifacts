The code snippet modifies the values of `median_index` and `operations`. The first line increments `median_index` by 1, and the second line increments `operations` by 1.

Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the median value in a plus 1, median_value is the median value of a, operations is 1**
