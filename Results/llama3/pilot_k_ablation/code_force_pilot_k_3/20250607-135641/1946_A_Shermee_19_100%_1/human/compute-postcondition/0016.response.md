Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the second test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least two more elements after the median that are equal to the median value, median_index is equal to its original value plus 1, median_value is the median value of a, operations is 2**

In this output state, the values of `test_cases`, `results`, `case`, `n`, `a`, and `median_value` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `median_index` is incremented by 1, and the value of `operations` is incremented by 1, resulting in `median_index` being equal to its original value plus 1 and `operations` being 2.
