Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, and has one more element which is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than the median value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value.**

The code block first unpacks the third test case into `n` and `a`. Then, it sorts `a` in ascending order. The median index is calculated as the integer division of `n-1` by 2, and the median value is assigned as the element at this index in `a`. Finally, `operations` is initialized to 0.
