To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `median_index` and `a` (specifically, the value at `a[median_index]`) since these are the variables involved in the loop condition.

1. `median_index` must be less than `n` to satisfy the first part of the condition. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 2, we don't need to adjust `n`. However, we need to ensure `median_index` is not equal to `n` to keep the loop condition true. Given that `median_index` is the index of the median value in `a` plus 1, and considering `a` is sorted in ascending order, we need to ensure that the median value is not the last element in `a` or that there are elements after the median that are equal to the median value.

2. `a[median_index]` must be equal to `median_value` to satisfy the second part of the condition. Since `median_value` is the median value of `a`, and `a` is sorted in ascending order, we need to ensure that there are elements after the median that are equal to the median value or that the median is not the last element in `a`.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments are focused on ensuring that `median_index` is less than `n` and that there are elements in `a` after the median that are equal to the median value, or that the median is not the last element in `a`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `case` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the first test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is the index of the median value in `a` plus 1 and must be less than `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is 1**
