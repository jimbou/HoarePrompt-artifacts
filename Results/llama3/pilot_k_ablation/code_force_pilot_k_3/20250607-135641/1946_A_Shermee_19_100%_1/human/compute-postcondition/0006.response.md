Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the first test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is the index of the median value in a plus 2, median_value is the median value of a, operations is 2**

In this output state, the initial state remains valid except for the variables `median_index` and `operations`, which are modified by the code. The `median_index` is incremented by 1, making it the index of the median value in `a` plus 2, and `operations` is incremented by 1, making it equal to 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
