Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list a of n integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has created a new empty list called `results`, but the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged. The `test_cases` list still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers. The `results` list is currently empty, waiting to be populated with results from the test cases.
