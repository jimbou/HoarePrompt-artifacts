Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value, `case` is the first test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the first test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the first test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than the median value, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.**

In this output state, the `results` list now contains the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value, which is stored in the `operations` variable. The other variables remain unchanged.
