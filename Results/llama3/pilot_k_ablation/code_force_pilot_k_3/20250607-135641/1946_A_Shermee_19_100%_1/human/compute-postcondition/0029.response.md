Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list containing the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, and has one more element which is the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, a is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in a, median_index is equal to n, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to the number of elements in a that are equal to the median value.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until `median_index` has reached `n`, which means that all elements in `a` that are equal to the median value have been counted. The value of `operations` is now equal to the total number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
