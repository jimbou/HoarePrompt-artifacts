To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 2 test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, and `case` is the first test case in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases, and `case` must be the second test case in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value, `case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the second test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than the median value, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.**
