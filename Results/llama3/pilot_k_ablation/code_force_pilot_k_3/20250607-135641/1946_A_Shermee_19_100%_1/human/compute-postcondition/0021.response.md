The only object in the loop head is variable  case and list test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 test cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 test cases and the case is the third test case in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list containing the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value, and has one more element which is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value, `case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is the second element of the third test case, sorted in ascending order, and must have at least one more element after the median that is equal to the median value or the median is not the last element in `a`, `median_index` is the index of the first element in `a` that is greater than the median value, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is the number of elements in `a` that are equal to the median value.**
