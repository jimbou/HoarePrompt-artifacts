Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, mod_y is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value.**

In this output state, the values of rem_x and rem_y have been updated based on the new values of num, x, and y. The count variable has been incremented by the sum of the frequencies of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively. The mod_x and mod_y dictionaries have been updated to include the new remainder of num divided by x and y as keys and their frequencies as values. All other variables remain unchanged.
