The `print(result)` statement will print the second element in the `results` list, which is returned by the function `func_1(test_cases)`. The `test_cases` list contains `t` tuples, each consisting of the integers `n`, `x`, `y`, and the list of integers `arr`. Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second element in the `results` list.

Output: **the second element in the results list (where results is returned by func_1(test_cases) and test_cases contains t tuples (n, x, y, arr))**
