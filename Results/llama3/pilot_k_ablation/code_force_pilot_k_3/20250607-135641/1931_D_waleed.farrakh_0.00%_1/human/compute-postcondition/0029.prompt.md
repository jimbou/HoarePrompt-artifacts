Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, num is the last element in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is 0, mod_x is an empty dictionary, mod_y is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
for num in arr:
    rem_x = -num % x
    rem_y = num % y
    count += mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) and mod_y.get(rem_y, 0)
    mod_x[num % x] = mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1
    mod_y[num % y] = mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, mod_y is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, mod_y is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, num is the third integer in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, mod_y is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
