Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer equal to the first line of stdin, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases is an empty list, idx is 2, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
    arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
    test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
    idx += 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases contains one tuple (n, x, y, arr), idx is 4, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read, n, x, and y are integers, arr is a list of integers

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases contains two tuples (n, x, y, arr), idx is 6, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read, n, x, and y are integers, arr is a list of integers

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 2, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases contains three tuples (n, x, y, arr), idx is 8, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read, n, x, and y are integers, arr is a list of integers




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
