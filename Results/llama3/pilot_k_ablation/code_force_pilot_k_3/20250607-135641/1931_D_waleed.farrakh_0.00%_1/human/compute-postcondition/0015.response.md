The only variable in the loop head is variable  result, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. If `results` has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in the `results` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `results` must have at least 3 elements and the `result` is the third element in the `results` list.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that has at least 3 elements and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), result is the third element in results**
