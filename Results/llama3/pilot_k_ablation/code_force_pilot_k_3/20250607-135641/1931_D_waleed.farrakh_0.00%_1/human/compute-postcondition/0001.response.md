According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer equal to the first line of stdin, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases is an empty list, idx is 2, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read**
