Output State: **t is greater than 2, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases contains three tuples (n, x, y, arr), idx is 8, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read, n, x, and y are integers, arr is a list of integers**

The code snippet executes the following operations:

1. `n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())`: This line assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` from the `idx`-th line of `data` to the corresponding variables. Since `idx` is 6, it reads the 7th line of `data` and splits it into three integers, which are assigned to `n`, `x`, and `y`, respectively.

2. `arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))`: This line assigns the values of `arr` from the `(idx + 1)`-th line of `data` to the `arr` variable. Since `idx` is 6, it reads the 8th line of `data` and splits it into a list of integers, which is assigned to `arr`.

3. `test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))`: This line appends a new tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list.

4. `idx += 2`: This line increments the value of `idx` by 2, making it 8.

After executing these operations, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `t` remains greater than 2, as it is not modified by the code.
* `data` remains a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, as it is not modified by the code.
* `test_cases` now contains three tuples, including the newly appended tuple `(n, x, y, arr)`.
* `idx` is now 8, after being incremented by 2.
* `stdin` remains empty except for the first line that has been read, as it is not modified by the code.
* `n`, `x`, and `y` are now integers, assigned from the 7th line of `data`.
* `arr` is now a list of integers, assigned from the 8th line of `data`.

Overall, the code snippet reads two lines from `data`, assigns their values to `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`, appends a new tuple to `test_cases`, and increments `idx` by 2.
