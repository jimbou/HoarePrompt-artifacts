The only variable in the loop head is variable  result, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the results has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, results is a list that is not empty and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, result is the first element in results. So for the loop to be executed one more time the results must have at least 2 elements and the result is the second element in the results.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that has at least 2 elements and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), result is the second element in results**
