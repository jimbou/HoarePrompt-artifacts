Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the third element in the `results` list. The `results` list is returned by the function `func_1(test_cases)`, where `test_cases` contains `t` tuples of the form `(n, x, y, arr)`. Since the exact values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can describe it as the third element in the list returned by `func_1(test_cases)`.

Output: **the third element in the list returned by func_1(test_cases)**
