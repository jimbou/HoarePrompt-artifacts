Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, and `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr).
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that is not empty and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), result is the first element in results, and the first element of the results list which is result is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that has at least 2 elements and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), result is the second element in results, and the second element of the results list which is returned by func_1(test_cases) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that has at least 3 elements and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), and the third element of the results list which is returned by `func_1(test_cases)` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
