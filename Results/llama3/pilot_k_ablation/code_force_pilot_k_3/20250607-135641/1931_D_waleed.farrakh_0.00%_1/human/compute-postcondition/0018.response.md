Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that has `t` elements and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), and all elements of the results list which is returned by `func_1(test_cases)` have been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `t`, `data`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The `results` list, which is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, has `t` elements, and all these elements have been printed. The `test_cases` list still contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr).
