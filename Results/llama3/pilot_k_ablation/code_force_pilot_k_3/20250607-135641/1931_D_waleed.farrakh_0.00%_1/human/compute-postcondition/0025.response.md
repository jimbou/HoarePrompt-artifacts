To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for num in arr:`, so we can only adjust the states of `num` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `num` is the first integer in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 2 integers, and `num` must be the second integer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `num` is the second integer in the list, `rem_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `rem_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `results` is a list that contains the value of count, `count` is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, `mod_x` is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, `mod_y` is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value**
