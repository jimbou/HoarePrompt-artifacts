Output State: **`test_cases` is an empty list, `n` is undefined, `x` is undefined, `y` is undefined, `arr` is undefined, `num` is undefined, `rem_x` is undefined, `rem_y` is undefined, `mod_x` is an empty dictionary, `mod_y` is an empty dictionary, `count` is undefined, and `results` is a list containing the counts of pairs of numbers in each tuple of `test_cases` that satisfy the given conditions.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the input list `test_cases` will be exhausted, and the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, `num`, `rem_x`, `rem_y`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y` will no longer have defined values. The `results` list will contain the counts of pairs of numbers in each tuple of `test_cases` that satisfy the given conditions, which are the sums of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders.
