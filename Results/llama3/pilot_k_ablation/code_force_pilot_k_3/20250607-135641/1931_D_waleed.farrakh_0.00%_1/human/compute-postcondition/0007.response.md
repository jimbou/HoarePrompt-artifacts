Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases contains t tuples (n, x, y, arr), idx is 2t + 2, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read, n, x, and y are integers, arr is a list of integers.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations specified by the value of `t`. The `test_cases` list now contains `t` tuples, each representing a test case with its respective values for `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`. The `idx` variable has been incremented by `2` for each iteration, resulting in a final value of `2t + 2`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, with `data` still being a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, and `stdin` being empty except for the first line that has been read.
