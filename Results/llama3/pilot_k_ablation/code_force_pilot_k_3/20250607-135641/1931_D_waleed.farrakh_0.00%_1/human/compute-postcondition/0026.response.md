Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, num is the second integer in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, mod_y is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value.**

The code block modifies the values of `rem_x`, `rem_y`, `count`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`. The first two lines update the values of `rem_x` and `rem_y` based on the current values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The third line increments the value of `count` by the sum of the frequencies of `rem_x` and `rem_y` in `mod_x` and `mod_y`, respectively. The last two lines update the frequencies of `num % x` and `num % y` in `mod_x` and `mod_y`, respectively. The values of `test_cases`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `results` remain unchanged.
