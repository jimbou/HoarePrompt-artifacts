Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four values: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers. `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for n, x, y, arr in test_cases:
    count = 0
    mod_x = {}
    mod_y = {}
    for num in arr:
        rem_x = -num % x
        rem_y = num % y
        count += mod_x.get(rem_x, 0) and mod_y.get(rem_y, 0)
        mod_x[num % x] = mod_x.get(num % x, 0) + 1
        mod_y[num % y] = mod_y.get(num % y, 0) + 1
    results.append(count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is an empty list, results is a list that contains the sum of the previous value of count and the product of the number of times rem_x appears in mod_x and the number of times rem_y appears in mod_y, mod_x is a dictionary where the key is the remainder of each element in arr divided by x and the value is the number of times this remainder appears, mod_y is a dictionary where the key is the remainder of each element in arr divided by y and the value is the number of times this remainder appears, num is the last element in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, count is the sum of the previous value of count and the product of the number of times rem_x appears in mod_x and the number of times rem_y appears in mod_y.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `count` is a non-negative integer equal to the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders, `mod_x` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the value is the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, `mod_y` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and the value is the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, `num` is the last element in the list, `rem_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`, `rem_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `num` is the last integer in the list, `rem_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `rem_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `mod_x` is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, `mod_y` is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value, `count` is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, `results` is a list that contains the value of count.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
