Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, and `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr).**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `data`, `idx`, `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged. The `results` variable is assigned the value returned by the function `func_1` when called with the argument `test_cases`. The `test_cases` variable still contains `t` tuples, each consisting of the values `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`.
