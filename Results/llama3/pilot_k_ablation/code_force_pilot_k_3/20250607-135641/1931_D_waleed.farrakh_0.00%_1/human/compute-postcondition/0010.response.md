The code prints the first element in the `results` list, which is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`. Since the exact values of `test_cases` and the function `func_1` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the first result returned by `func_1` when it is applied to the test cases.

Output: **result (where result is the first element in the results list returned by func_1(test_cases))**
