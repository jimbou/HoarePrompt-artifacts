Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, num is the last element in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is 0, mod_x is an empty dictionary, mod_y is an empty dictionary.**

The code resets the values of `count`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`. The value of `count` is set to 0, and the dictionaries `mod_x` and `mod_y` are emptied. All other variables remain unchanged.
