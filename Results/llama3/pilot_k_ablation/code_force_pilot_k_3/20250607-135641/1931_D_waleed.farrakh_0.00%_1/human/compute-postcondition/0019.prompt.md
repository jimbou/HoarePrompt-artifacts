You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains four elements: n, x, y, and arr. n is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers, and arr is a list of positive integers.
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().splitlines()
    t = int(data[0])
    test_cases = []
    idx = 1
    for _ in range(t):
        n, x, y = map(int, data[idx].split())
        
        arr = list(map(int, data[idx + 1].split()))
        
        test_cases.append((n, x, y, arr))
        
        idx += 2
        
    #State: t is greater than or equal to 0, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases contains t tuples (n, x, y, arr), idx is 2t + 2, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read, n, x, and y are integers, arr is a list of integers.
    results = func_1(test_cases)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that has `t` elements and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), and all elements of the results list which is returned by `func_1(test_cases)` have been printed.

```

Return Postconditions: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that has `t` elements and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), and all elements of the results list which is returned by `func_1(test_cases)` have been printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
