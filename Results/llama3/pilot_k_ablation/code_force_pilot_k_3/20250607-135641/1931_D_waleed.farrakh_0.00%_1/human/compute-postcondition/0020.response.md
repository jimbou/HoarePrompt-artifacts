Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is an empty list, `count` is a non-negative integer equal to the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders, `mod_x` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the value is the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, `mod_y` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and the value is the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, `num` is the last element in the list, `rem_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`, `rem_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count`.**

The code appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `test_cases` list now has at least 1 tuple, as one tuple has been processed.
