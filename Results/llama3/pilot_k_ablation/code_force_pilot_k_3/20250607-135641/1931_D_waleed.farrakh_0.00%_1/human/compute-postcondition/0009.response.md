To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `result` and the list `results`. The loop will execute if `results` is not empty. Since `results` is returned by `func_1(test_cases)` and `test_cases` contains `t` tuples, we need `t` to be greater than 0 to ensure `results` is not empty. Also, `result` will be the first element in `results` at the start of the loop.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, `idx` is 2t + 2, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `arr` is a list of integers, `results` is a list that is not empty and is returned by `func_1(test_cases)`, `test_cases` contains `t` tuples (n, x, y, arr), result is the first element in results**
