Output State: **t is greater than 1, data is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, test_cases contains two tuples (n, x, y, arr), idx is 6, stdin is empty except for the first line that has been read, n, x, and y are integers, arr is a list of integers**

The code block executes as follows:

1. The first line assigns the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` to the corresponding variables. Since `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, and `idx` is 4, the values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are extracted from the 5th line of stdin (since indexing starts at 0). The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers.

2. The second line assigns the values of `arr` to the corresponding variable. Since `data` is a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, and `idx` is 4, the values of `arr` are extracted from the 6th line of stdin (since indexing starts at 0). The values of `arr` are a list of integers.

3. The third line appends a tuple containing the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr` to the `test_cases` list. Since `test_cases` initially contains one tuple, it now contains two tuples.

4. The fourth line increments the value of `idx` by 2, making it 6.

The final state of the program is as follows:

* `t` is still greater than 1, as it was not modified by the code.
* `data` is still a list of strings split from the lines of stdin, as it was not modified by the code.
* `test_cases` now contains two tuples, as a new tuple was appended to it.
* `idx` is now 6, as it was incremented by 2.
* `stdin` is still empty except for the first line that has been read, as no new input was read.
* `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers, as they were assigned integer values from the 5th line of stdin.
* `arr` is a list of integers, as it was assigned a list of integers from the 6th line of stdin.
