Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `num` is the last integer in the list, `rem_x` is the remainder of -num divided by x, `rem_y` is the remainder of num divided by y, `mod_x` is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, `mod_y` is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value, `count` is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, `results` is a list that contains the value of count.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of results now contains the sum of the frequencies of the remainders of the last integer in the list when divided by x and y, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged.
