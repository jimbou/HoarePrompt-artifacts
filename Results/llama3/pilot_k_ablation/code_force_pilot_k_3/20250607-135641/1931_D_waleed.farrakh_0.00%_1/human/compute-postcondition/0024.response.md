Output State: **test_cases is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, y is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, num is the first integer in the list, rem_x is the remainder of -num divided by x, rem_y is the remainder of num divided by y, results is a list that contains the value of count, count is the sum of the values of rem_x and rem_y in mod_x and mod_y respectively, mod_x is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by x as a key and its frequency as a value, mod_y is a dictionary containing the remainder of num divided by y as a key and its frequency as a value.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The code snippet modifies the values of `rem_x`, `rem_y`, `count`, `mod_x`, and `mod_y`. The value of `rem_x` is updated to be the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`, and the value of `rem_y` is updated to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The value of `count` is incremented by the sum of the values of `rem_x` and `rem_y` in the `mod_x` and `mod_y` dictionaries, respectively. The `mod_x` dictionary is updated to contain the remainder of `num` divided by `x` as a key and its frequency as a value, and the `mod_y` dictionary is updated to contain the remainder of `num` divided by `y` as a key and its frequency as a value. All other variables remain unchanged.
