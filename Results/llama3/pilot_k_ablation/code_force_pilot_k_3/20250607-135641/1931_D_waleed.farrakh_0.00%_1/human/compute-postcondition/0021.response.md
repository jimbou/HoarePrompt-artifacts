To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variables `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 1 tuple. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 2 tuples. The other variables in the loop head (`n`, `x`, `y`, and `arr`) are assigned new values from the next tuple in `test_cases`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of tuples that must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `count` is a non-negative integer equal to the sum of the products of the values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` for all remainders, `mod_x` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `x` and the value is the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, `mod_y` is a dictionary with key-value pairs where the key is the remainder of `num` divided by `y` and the value is the number of times `num` appears in `arr`, `num` is the last element in the list, `rem_x` is the remainder of `-num` divided by `x`, `rem_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `results` is a list that contains the value of `count`**
