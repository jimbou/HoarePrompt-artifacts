Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of beautiful pairs in the array based on the given conditions.

The program uses two dictionaries, `mod_x` and `mod_y`, to store the remainders of the numbers in the array when divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. It then iterates through the array, updating the count of beautiful pairs by checking if the remainder of the current number when divided by `x` is equal to the negative remainder of the previous number when divided by `x`, and if the remainder of the current number when divided by `y` is equal to the remainder of the previous number when divided by `y`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the case where `x` or `y` is 1, and the case where the array contains duplicate numbers. It also correctly handles the case where the array is empty or contains only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
