Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs of numbers in the corresponding test case that satisfy the given conditions.

func_2 reads the input from stdin, processes it into a list of test cases, calls func_1 with the test cases, and prints the results.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in each test case. It uses dictionaries to store the remainders of the numbers in the array when divided by x and y, and then uses these dictionaries to count the number of pairs that satisfy the conditions.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
