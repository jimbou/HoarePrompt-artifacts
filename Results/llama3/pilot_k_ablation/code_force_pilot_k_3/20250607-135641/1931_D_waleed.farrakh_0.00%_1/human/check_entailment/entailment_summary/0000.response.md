Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. func_1 takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case is a tuple containing a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It returns a list of counts, where each count represents the number of pairs of numbers in the corresponding test case that satisfy the condition.

func_2 reads the input from the standard input, processes it, and calls func_1 with the test cases. It then prints the results returned by func_1.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array. The use of dictionaries to store the remainders of the numbers when divided by x and y is an efficient approach to count the pairs that satisfy the condition.

The execution summaries of the functions also indicate that the program is correct. func_1 returns the correct counts for each test case, and func_2 prints the results as expected.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
