The function accepts a list of test cases, where each test case is a tuple containing four elements: a positive integer n, two positive integers x and y, and a list of positive integers arr. It processes each test case and returns a list of results, one for each test case. The function then prints each result. The final state of the program is that all results have been printed, and the input variables remain unchanged.
