Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases:

1.  If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.
2.  If `n` equals `k`, it prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1. This way, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels.
3.  If `n` is greater than `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls: one with a price of `n-k+1` and another with a price of 1. This way, Alice will buy exactly `k` jewels. If `k-1` is not less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to set up stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
