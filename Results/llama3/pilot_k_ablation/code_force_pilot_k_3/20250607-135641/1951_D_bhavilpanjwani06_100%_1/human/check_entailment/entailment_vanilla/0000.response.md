Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Bob can set up his store to ensure Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program takes two inputs, n and k, representing the number of coins Alice has and the number of jewels Bob wants Alice to buy, respectively.

The program first checks if n is less than k. If this is the case, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy more jewels than she has coins.

If n is equal to k, the program prints 'YES' and sets up a single stall with a price of 1. This is because Alice can buy exactly k jewels if the price of each jewel is 1.

If n is greater than k, the program checks if k - 1 is less than n - k + 1. If this is the case, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls. The first stall has a price of n - k + 1, and the second stall has a price of 1. This is because Alice can buy k - 1 jewels at the first stall and 1 jewel at the second stall, resulting in a total of k jewels.

If none of the above conditions are met, the program prints 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
