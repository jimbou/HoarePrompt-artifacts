Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`. In this case, the program prints 'NO', but it is actually possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, if `n = 100` and `k = 50`, the program prints 'NO', but it is possible to set up two stalls with prices `50` and `1` respectively, so that Alice buys `50` jewels in total.

The correct solution should be able to handle this case and print 'YES' with the correct stall prices.
