Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases for the problem. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to buy exactly k jewels with less than k coins. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, so Alice will buy exactly k jewels. If n is greater than k, it checks if k - 1 is less than n - k + 1. If this condition is true, it sets up two stalls: the first with a price of n - k + 1 and the second with a price of 1. This way, Alice will buy exactly k jewels. If the condition is false, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible to set up the stalls in such a way that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Correctness: **True**
