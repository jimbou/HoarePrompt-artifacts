Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible for Bob to set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels. The program handles three cases:

1. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels.
2. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.
3. If n is greater than k, it checks if k-1 is less than n-k+1. If true, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls with prices n-k+1 and 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels. If false, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
