The code prints the difference between `n` and `k` plus 1, and the number 1.

Since `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18) and `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), and `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`, the difference `n - k` will be a positive integer. Adding 1 to this difference results in a positive integer greater than 1.

The number 1 is printed as is.

Output: **(n - k + 1) (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer greater than 1), 1**
