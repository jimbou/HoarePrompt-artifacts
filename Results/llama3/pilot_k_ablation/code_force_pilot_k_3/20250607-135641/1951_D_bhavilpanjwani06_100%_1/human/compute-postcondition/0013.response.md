Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `k-1` is less than the current value of `n-k+1`.**
