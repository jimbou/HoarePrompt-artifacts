Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. If `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the value of `n - k + 1` and the number 1 are printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
