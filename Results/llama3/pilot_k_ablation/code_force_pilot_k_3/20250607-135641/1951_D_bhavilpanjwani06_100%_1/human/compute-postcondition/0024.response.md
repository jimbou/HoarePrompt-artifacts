Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18), `n` is not less than `k`. If `n` equals `k`, 'YES' is printed, and 1 is printed twice. If `n` is not equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, the number 2 is printed, and the value of `n - k + 1` and the number 1 are printed if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
