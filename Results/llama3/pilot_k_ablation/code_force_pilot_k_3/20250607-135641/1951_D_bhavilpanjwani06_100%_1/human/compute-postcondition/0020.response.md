Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18). `n` is not less than `k` and `n` is not equal to `k`. (k - 1) is not less than (n - k + 1)***
