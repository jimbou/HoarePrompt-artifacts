Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), `k` is a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), stdin contains an integer t-1 (0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are assigned the first two positive integers from the input, and the stdin now contains t-1 lines, each with two positive integers. The range of `n` and `k` is specified as 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and the range of t-1 is 0 ≤ t-1 ≤ 999.
