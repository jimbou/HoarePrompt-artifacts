Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to partition a set of `n` elements into `k` non-empty subsets, where `n` and `k` are positive integers. It reads input from stdin, where each line contains two positive integers `n` and `k`. The function prints 'YES' if partitioning is possible and 'NO' otherwise. If partitioning is possible, it also prints the number of subsets and the size of each subset. The function handles three cases: (1) `n` is less than `k`, in which case it prints 'NO'; (2) `n` is equal to `k`, in which case it prints 'YES' and the size of each subset (1); and (3) `n` is greater than `k`, in which case it prints 'YES' and the size of each subset if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
