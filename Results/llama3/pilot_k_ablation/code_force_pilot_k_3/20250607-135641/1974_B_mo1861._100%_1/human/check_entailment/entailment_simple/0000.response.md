Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The `func_1` function takes an encoded string `encoded` as input.
2. It first finds the unique characters in the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order to form the string `r`.
3. It then creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its corresponding character in the reversed string `r`.
4. Finally, it uses this character mapping to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character, resulting in the original string `s`.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
