Reasoning:

1. The problem description clearly states that the encoding algorithm replaces each character in the string s with its symmetric character from the string r, which consists of all distinct letters of the string s in alphabetical order.

2. The provided Python program attempts to reverse this encoding process by first finding the unique characters in the encoded string, sorting them in alphabetical order to form the string r, and then creating a character map that maps each character in the encoded string to its symmetric character in the string r.

3. The program then uses this character map to decode the encoded string by replacing each character with its symmetric character.

4. The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

5. The program also handles the case where the input string contains duplicate characters, as it correctly identifies the unique characters in the string and forms the string r accordingly.

6. The program's use of a dictionary to create the character map is efficient, as it allows for constant-time lookups of the symmetric characters.

7. The program's output is also correct, as it joins the decoded characters into a single string and returns it.

Correctness: **True**
