Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly performs the decoding of the encoded string according to the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string and sorts them in alphabetical order to form the auxiliary string `r`.
2. It then creates a character mapping `char_map` where each character in `r` is mapped to its symmetric character (i.e., the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`).
3. Finally, it uses this mapping to replace each character in the encoded string with its corresponding decoded character.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with repeated characters
* Strings with characters that are not present in the auxiliary string `r`
* Strings of length 1 (i.e., single-character strings)

The program also correctly handles the edge case where the input string is empty (although this case is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description).

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
