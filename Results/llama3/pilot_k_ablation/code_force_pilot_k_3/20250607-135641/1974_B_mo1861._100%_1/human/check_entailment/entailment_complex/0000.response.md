Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `encoded`. This is done by using the `set` function to get the unique characters, sorting them using the `sorted` function, and then joining them into a string using the `join` function.

2. The program correctly creates a character mapping `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its corresponding character in the reversed string `r`. This is done by using a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where each key is a character in `r` and its corresponding value is the character at the same index from the end of `r`.

3. The program correctly decodes the encoded string `encoded` by replacing each character with its corresponding character in `r` using the `char_map`. This is done by using a generator expression to iterate over each character in `encoded`, replacing it with its corresponding character in `r` using the `char_map`, and then joining the resulting characters into a string using the `join` function.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the input string `encoded` contains duplicate characters. This is because the `set` function is used to get the unique characters in `encoded`, which ensures that each character in `r` is unique.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the input string `encoded` is empty. This is because the `join` function returns an empty string when given an empty iterable, which ensures that the program returns an empty string when given an empty input.

Overall, the program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement, and it handles all the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
