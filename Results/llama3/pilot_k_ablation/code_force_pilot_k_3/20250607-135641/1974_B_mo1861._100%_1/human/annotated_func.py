#State of the program right berfore the function call: encoded is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
    unique_chars = sorted(set(encoded))
    r = ''.join(unique_chars)
    char_map = {char: r[-i - 1] for i, char in enumerate(r)}
    decoded = ''.join(char_map[char] for char in encoded)
    return decoded
    #The program returns a string consisting of the characters in 'encoded', with each character replaced by its corresponding character in 'r', where 'r' is a string consisting of the unique characters in 'encoded' in reverse order.

#Overall this is what the function does:Replaces each character in the input string 'encoded' with its corresponding character in a string 'r', which consists of the unique characters in 'encoded' in reverse order, and returns the resulting string.
