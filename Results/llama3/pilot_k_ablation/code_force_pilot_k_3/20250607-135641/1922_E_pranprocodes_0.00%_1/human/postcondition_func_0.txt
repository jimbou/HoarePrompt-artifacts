This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case is an integer X. For each test case, it repeatedly applies a transformation to X until it becomes 1, keeping track of the number of transformations and the values of a maximum and minimum counter. The function then prints the number of transformations and the sequence of maximum and minimum counter values in the order they were generated. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
