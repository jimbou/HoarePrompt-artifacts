Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input X is 3. The program will output [0, -1, 0] which has only 3 increasing subsequences ([], [0], [0, -1, 0]), but the problem requires exactly X increasing subsequences, which is 3 in this case. However, the program's output has 4 increasing subsequences ([], [0], [0, -1], [0, -1, 0]).
