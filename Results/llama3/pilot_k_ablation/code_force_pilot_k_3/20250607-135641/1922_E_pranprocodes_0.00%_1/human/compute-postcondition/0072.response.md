The code prints the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were appended to the `ans` string, and the number of times the loop executes which is equal to `t`.

Since `x` is 1 (an odd number), the loop executes `t` times, and `min` is the original value of `min` plus the number of times the loop executes, which is `t`. The value of `max` remains unchanged because `x` is odd.

The `ans` string contains the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were appended. Since `x` is odd, `min` is appended first, followed by `max`.

Output: **[min (which is the original value of min plus t), max (which is the original value of max), t (which is the number of times the loop executes)]**
