The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is its original value minus 2 if its original value is even, otherwise x is its original value minus 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must not be equal to 1.
State: **`i` is 0, `x` is its original value minus 2 if its original value is even, otherwise `x` is its original value minus 3 and x is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000 -100000000', `t` is 2, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus two)**
