Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is its original value minus 2 if its original value is even, otherwise `x` is its original value minus 3 and x is not equal to 1. `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000 and `max` is now decreased by 1 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is not changed. `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999. `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000 -100000000' and now `max` is appended to `ans` if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000 99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-99999999 -100000000 -100000000'. `t` is 3, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus three).**

The code increments the value of `t` by 1, so `t` is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged, so their values are the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus three).
