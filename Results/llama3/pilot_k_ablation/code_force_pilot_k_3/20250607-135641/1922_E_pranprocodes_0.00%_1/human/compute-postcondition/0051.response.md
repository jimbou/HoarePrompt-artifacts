To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `x != 1`. The loop will execute if `x` is not equal to 1. Given that `x` is an integer from stdin, we need to adjust its state to guarantee the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`i` is 2, `x` is not equal to 1, `t` is 0, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, `ans` is an empty string, stdin contains one less input than initially**
