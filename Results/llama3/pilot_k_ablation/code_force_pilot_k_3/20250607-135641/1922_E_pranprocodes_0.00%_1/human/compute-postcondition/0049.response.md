The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `int(input())`. If `i` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `int(input())` is 7. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 2, `x` is 1, `t` is 7, `max` is 99999997, `min` is -99999997, `ans` is '99999997 99999998 99999999 100000000 -99999997 -99999998 -99999999'**
