To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and the loop has executed `t` times. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and there must be at least one more input in `stdin` (since `i` is used to iterate over the input).

State: **`i` is 1, `x` is 1, `max` is 100000000 minus the number of times `x` was even, `min` is -100000000 plus the number of times `x` was odd, `ans` is a string of space-separated integers from `max` to `min`, `t` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1, `stdin` contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus the number of times the loop executed minus 1)**
