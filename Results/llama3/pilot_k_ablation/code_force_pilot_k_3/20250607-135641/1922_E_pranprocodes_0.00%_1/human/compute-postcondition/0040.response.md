Output State: **i is 1, t is 2, x is not equal to 1 and is half of its original value, max is 99999997 or 99999998, min is -100000000 or -99999999, and ans contains the original max followed by a space and the original ans.**

The first line of code assigns the value of `max` followed by a space and the original `ans` to `ans`. Since `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, and `ans` contains the original `max` or `min` followed by a space and the original `ans`, the new `ans` will contain the original `max` followed by a space and the original `ans`.

The second line of code decrements `max` by 1. Since `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, it becomes 99999997 or 99999998.

The third line of code assigns the value of `x` divided by 2 to `x`. Since `x` is not equal to 1, its value is halved.

The values of `i` and `t` are not affected by the code, so they remain the same. The value of `min` is also not affected, so it remains -100000000 or -99999999.
