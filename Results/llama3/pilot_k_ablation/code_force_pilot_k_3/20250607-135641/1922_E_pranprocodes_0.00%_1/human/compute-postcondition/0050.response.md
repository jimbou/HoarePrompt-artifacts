Output State: **i is 2, x is an integer from stdin, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, stdin contains one less input than initially**.

The code snippet assigns the integer value of the input to `x`, making `x` equal to that integer. It then sets `max` to 100000000 and `min` to -100000000, overwriting their previous values. The variable `ans` is set to an empty string, replacing its initial value. Finally, `t` is set to 0, changing its initial value of 7. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains one less input than initially, as one integer was consumed by the input operation.
