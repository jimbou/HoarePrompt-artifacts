Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 2, x is an integer from stdin, t is 0, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, stdin contains one less input than initially
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 2, `t` is 1, stdin contains one less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, and `ans` contains the original value of `max` followed by a space. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains the original value of `min`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 2, `t` is 2, stdin contains one less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is a number greater than 1 and less than half of its original value, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is a string containing the value of `min`, `min` is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 2, `t` is 3, stdin contains one less input than initially. `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is a number greater than 0 and less than half of its original value, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is one less than its original value, `min` is 2. If `x` is odd, `x` is greater than 0 and one less than its original value, `ans` is a string containing the value of `min` followed by a space and its original value, `min` is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
