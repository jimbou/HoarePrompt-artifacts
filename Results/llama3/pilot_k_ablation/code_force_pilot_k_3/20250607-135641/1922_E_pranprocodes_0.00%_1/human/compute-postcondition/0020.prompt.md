Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 0, x is a positive integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, t is 0, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus one)
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 0, `x` is half of its original value if its original value is even, otherwise `x` is its original value minus 1, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000', `t` is 1, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus one)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 0, `x` is its original value minus 2 if its original value is even, otherwise `x` is its original value minus 3, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000 -100000000', `t` is 2, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus two)
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 0, `x` is its original value minus 2 if its original value is even, otherwise `x` is its original value minus 3 and x is not equal to 1. `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000 and `max` is now decreased by 1 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is not changed. `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999. `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000 -100000000' and now `max` is appended to `ans` if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000 99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-99999999 -100000000 -100000000'. `t` is 3, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus three).


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
