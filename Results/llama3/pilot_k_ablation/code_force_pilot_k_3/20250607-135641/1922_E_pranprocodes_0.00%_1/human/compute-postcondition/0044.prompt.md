Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is 1, x is an integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, t is 0, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus the number of times the loop executed minus 2)
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `t` is 1, if `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` remains -100000000, `ans` contains the original `max` followed by a space, if `x` is odd, `max` remains 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000 '
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `i` is 1, `t` is 2, if `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` remains -100000000, and `ans` contains the original `max` followed by a space and the original `ans`. If `x` is odd, `x` is one less than its original value, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains the original `min` followed by a space and the original `max` followed by a space.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `i` is 1, `t` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is decreased by 1, and `ans` contains the original `max` followed by a space and the original `ans`. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `min` is increased by 1, and `ans` contains the original `min` followed by a space and the original `max` or `min` followed by a space and the original `ans`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
