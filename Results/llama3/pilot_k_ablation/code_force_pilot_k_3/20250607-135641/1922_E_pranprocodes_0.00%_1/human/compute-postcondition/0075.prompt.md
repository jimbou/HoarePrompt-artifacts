You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). The number of test cases is a positive integer and the values of X are integers such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
    for i in range(int(input())):
        x = int(input())
        
        max = 100000000
        
        min = -100000000
        
        ans = ''
        
        t = 0
        
        while x != 1:
            if x % 2 == 0:
                ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
                max -= 1
                x = x // 2
            else:
                ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
                min += 1
                x -= 1
            t += 1
        
        print(t)
        
        print(*ans)
        
    #State: i is equal to the initial number of test cases, x is 1, t is the number of times the loop executes, max is the original value of max minus the number of times the loop executes when x is even, min is the original value of min plus the number of times the loop executes when x is odd, ans is a string containing the values of max and min in the order they were appended, stdin contains no inputs, and the number of times the loop executes which is equal to t is being printed, and the values of max and min in the order they were appended are being printed.

```

Return Postconditions: i is equal to the initial number of test cases, x is 1, t is the number of times the loop executes, max is the original value of max minus the number of times the loop executes when x is even, min is the original value of min plus the number of times the loop executes when x is odd, ans is a string containing the values of max and min in the order they were appended, stdin contains no inputs, and the number of times the loop executes which is equal to t is being printed, and the values of max and min in the order they were appended are being printed.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
