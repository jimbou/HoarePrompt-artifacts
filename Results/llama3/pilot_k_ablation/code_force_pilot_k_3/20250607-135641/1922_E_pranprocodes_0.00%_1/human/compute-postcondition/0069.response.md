Output State: `i` is 2, `t` is the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains one less input than initially, `x` is 1, `max` is the original value of `max` minus the number of times the loop executes when `x` is even, `min` is the original value of `min` plus the number of times the loop executes when `x` is odd, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were appended.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` remains unchanged, the value of `t` is equal to the number of times the loop executes, the value of `x` becomes 1, the value of `max` decreases by the number of times the loop executes when `x` is even, the value of `min` increases by the number of times the loop executes when `x` is odd, and the value of `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were appended.
