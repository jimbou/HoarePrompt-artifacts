Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 3, stdin contains one less input than initially. `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is a number greater than 0 and less than half of its original value, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is one less than its original value, `min` is 2. If `x` is odd, `x` is greater than 0 and one less than its original value, `ans` is a string containing the value of `min` followed by a space and its original value, `min` is 3.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so `t` is now 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The conditions on `x`, `ans`, `max`, and `min` remain the same, as they are not modified by the code.
