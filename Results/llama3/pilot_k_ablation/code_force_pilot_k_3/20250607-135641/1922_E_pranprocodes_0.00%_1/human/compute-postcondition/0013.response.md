Output State: **`i` is 0, `x` is its original value minus 2 if its original value is even, otherwise `x` is its original value minus 3, `max` is 99999998 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '99999999 100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000 -100000000', `t` is 2, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus two)**.

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least one input, which is an integer representing the number of test cases minus two.
