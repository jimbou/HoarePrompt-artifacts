Output State: **i is 1, x is an integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, t is 0, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus the number of times the loop executed minus 2)**

The code snippet first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `x`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1. The next three lines reset the values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` to their initial values, effectively discarding any previous values they might have had. The last line sets `t` to 0, which means the loop has not executed yet. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
