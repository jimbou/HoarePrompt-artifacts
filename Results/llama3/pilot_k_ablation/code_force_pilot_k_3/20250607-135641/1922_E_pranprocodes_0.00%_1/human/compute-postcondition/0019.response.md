Output State: `i` is 0, `x` is 1, `max` is a value between -100000000 and 100000000, `min` is a value between -100000000 and 100000000, `ans` is a string of space-separated integers, `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus one)

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
* The value of `x` is 1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
* The value of `max` is a value between -100000000 and 100000000, which is the result of repeatedly decrementing `max` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
* The value of `min` is a value between -100000000 and 100000000, which is the result of repeatedly incrementing `min` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
* The value of `ans` is a string of space-separated integers, which is the result of appending `max` or `min` to `ans` in each iteration of the loop.
* The value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of iterations the loop has executed.
* The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus one).
