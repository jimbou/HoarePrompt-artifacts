Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a list of integers (the values of X for each test case). The number of test cases is a positive integer and the values of X are integers such that 2 <= X <= 10^18.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = ''
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, x is 1, max is 100000000 minus the number of times x was even, min is -100000000 plus the number of times x was odd, ans is a string of space-separated integers from max to min, t is the number of times the loop executed, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus the number of times the loop executed), and the number of times the loop executed which is t is being printed, and the string of space-separated integers from max to min is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, x is 1, t is 7, max is 99999997, min is -99999997, ans is '99999997 99999998 99999999 100000000 -99999997 -99999998 -99999999', the value of t which is 7 is being printed, and the elements of ans which are '99999997 99999998 99999999 100000000 -99999997 -99999998 -99999999' are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `t` is the number of times the loop executes, stdin contains one less input than initially, `x` is 1, `max` is the original value of `max` minus the number of times the loop executes when `x` is even, `min` is the original value of `min` plus the number of times the loop executes when `x` is odd, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were appended, and the number of times the loop executes which is equal to `t` is being printed, and the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were appended are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
