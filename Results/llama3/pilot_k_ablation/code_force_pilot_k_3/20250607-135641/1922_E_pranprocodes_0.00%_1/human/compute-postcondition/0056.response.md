Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `t` is 0, stdin contains one less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, and `ans` contains the original value of `max` followed by a space. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains the original value of `min`.***
