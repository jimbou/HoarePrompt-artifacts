Output State: **i is 0, x is 1, max is 100000000 minus the number of times x was even, min is -100000000 plus the number of times x was odd, ans is a string of space-separated integers from max to min, t is the number of times the loop executed, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus the number of times the loop executed).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

* The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0.
* The variable `x` becomes 1, as the loop continues until `x` is no longer equal to 1.
* The variable `max` decreases by 1 each time `x` is even, so its final value is 100000000 minus the number of times `x` was even.
* The variable `min` increases by 1 each time `x` is odd, so its final value is -100000000 plus the number of times `x` was odd.
* The variable `ans` is a string of space-separated integers from `max` to `min`, where each integer is appended to the front of the string in the order they are generated.
* The variable `t` is the number of times the loop executed, which is equal to the number of times `x` was divided by 2 (when `x` is even) or decremented by 1 (when `x` is odd).
* The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus the number of times the loop executed).
