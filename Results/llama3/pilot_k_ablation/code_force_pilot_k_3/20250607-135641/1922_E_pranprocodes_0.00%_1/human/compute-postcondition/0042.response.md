Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is decreased by 1, and `ans` contains the original `max` followed by a space and the original `ans`. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `min` is increased by 1, and `ans` contains the original `min` followed by a space and the original `max` or `min` followed by a space and the original `ans`.***
