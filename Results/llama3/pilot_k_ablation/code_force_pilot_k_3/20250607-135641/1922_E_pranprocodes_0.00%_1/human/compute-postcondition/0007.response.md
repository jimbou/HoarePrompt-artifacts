Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `x` is a positive integer, `max` is 99999999 if `x` is even, otherwise `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000 if `x` is even, otherwise `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '100000000 ' if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` is '-100000000', `t` is 0, `x` is half of its original value if `x` is even, otherwise `x` is its original value minus 1, stdin contains at least one input: an integer (the number of test cases minus one)***
