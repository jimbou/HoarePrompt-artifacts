Output State: **`i` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `t` is 1, if `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` remains -100000000, `ans` contains the original `max` followed by a space, if `x` is odd, `max` remains 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000 '**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `i` remains 1, and `x` is still not equal to 1. The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state, depending on whether `x` is even or odd.
