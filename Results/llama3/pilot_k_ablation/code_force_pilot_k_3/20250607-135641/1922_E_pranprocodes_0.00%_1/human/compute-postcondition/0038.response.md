Output State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, if `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999998, `min` remains -100000000, and `ans` contains the original `max` followed by a space and the original `ans`. If `x` is odd, `x` is one less than its original value, `max` is 99999999, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains the original `min` followed by a space and the original `max` followed by a space.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 2. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged, with their values still dependent on whether `x` is even or odd.
