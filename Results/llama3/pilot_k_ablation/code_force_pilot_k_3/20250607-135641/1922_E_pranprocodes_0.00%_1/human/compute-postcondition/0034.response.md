According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is not equal to 1, so no adjustment is needed for `x`. The loop can certainly execute one more time.
State: **`i` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1, `t` is 1, if `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, `min` remains -100000000, `ans` contains the original `max` followed by a space, if `x` is odd, `max` remains 100000000, `min` is -99999999, `ans` is '-100000000 '**
