Output State: **i is 1, x is not equal to 1 and is one less than its original value, t is 1, max is 99999999, min is -99999999, ans contains the original min followed by a space and the original max followed by a space.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `min`, `x`, and `ans`. The first line appends the value of `min` followed by a space to the beginning of `ans`. Since `min` is -99999999, `ans` becomes '-99999999 99999999 '. The second line increments `min` by 1, making it -99999998. The third line decrements `x` by 1, making it one less than its original value. The values of `i` and `t` remain unchanged.
