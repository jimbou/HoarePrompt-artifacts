The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, there are two possible scenarios:

1. If x is even, x is halved.
2. If x is odd, x is one less than its original value.

In both cases, x is not equal to 1, so we need to adjust x to be not equal to 1.

State: **`i` is 1, `t` is 2, `x` is not equal to 1, `max` is 99999998 or 99999999, `min` is -100000000 or -99999999, and `ans` contains the original `max` or `min` followed by a space and the original `ans`**
