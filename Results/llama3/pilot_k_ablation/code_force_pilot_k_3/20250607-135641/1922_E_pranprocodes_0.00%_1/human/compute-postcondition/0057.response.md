Output State: **`i` is 2, `t` is 1, stdin contains one less input than initially. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `max` is 99999999, and `ans` contains the original value of `max` followed by a space. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `min` is -99999999, and `ans` contains the original value of `min`.**

The code increments the value of `t` by 1, so the new value of `t` is 1. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one less input than initially. The conditions for `x` being even or odd and their corresponding effects on `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` are still valid.
