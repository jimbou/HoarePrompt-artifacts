Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program iterates over the string, checking every substring of length 3. If the substring is 'map' or 'pie', it increments the answer and moves the index 3 positions forward. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index 1 position forward. This ensures that the program counts the non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
