Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie". For example, if the input string is "mapie", the program will count it as two separate substrings and return 2, but the correct answer is 1 because only one character needs to be removed to make the string beautiful.

The issue is that the program increments the index `i` by 3 when it finds a match, but it should only increment it by 1 to check for overlapping substrings. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = input()
        ans = 0
        i = 0
        while i < len(a) - 2:
            s = a[i:i + 3]
            if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
                ans += 1
            i += 1
        print(ans)
```

This corrected code will correctly count the minimum number of characters that need to be removed to make the string beautiful, even in cases where the input string contains overlapping substrings "map" or "pie".
