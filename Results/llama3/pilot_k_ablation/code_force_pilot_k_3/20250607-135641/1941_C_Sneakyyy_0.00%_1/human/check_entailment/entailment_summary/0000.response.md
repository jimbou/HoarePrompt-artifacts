Reasoning:

The given program is designed to count the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in a given string. It iterates through the string, checking every 3-character substring to see if it matches either 'map' or 'pie'. If a match is found, it increments the counter and moves the index 3 positions forward. If no match is found, it moves the index 1 position forward.

However, the problem statement asks for the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful, not the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings. The program's logic does not take into account the fact that deleting a character can make the string beautiful even if it's not part of a non-overlapping occurrence of 'map' or 'pie'.

For example, in the test case "mmapnapie", the program would count 2 occurrences of 'map' or 'pie', but the correct answer is 2, because deleting the 4th and 9th characters would make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
