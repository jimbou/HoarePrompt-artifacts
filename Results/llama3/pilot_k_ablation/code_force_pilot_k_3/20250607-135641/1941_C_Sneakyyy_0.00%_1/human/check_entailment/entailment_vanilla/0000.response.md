Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. The string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string and the string itself.
3. It initializes a variable `ans` to 0, which will store the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.
4. It uses a while loop to iterate over the string, checking every substring of length 3.
5. If the substring is "map" or "pie", it increments `ans` by 1 and moves the index `i` 3 positions forward.
6. If the substring is not "map" or "pie", it moves the index `i` 1 position forward.
7. After iterating over the entire string, it prints the value of `ans`, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program only checks substrings of length 3, but it does not consider the case where the string contains "map" or "pie" as a substring of a larger string. For example, if the input string is "mappppie", the program will only detect the "map" substring and not the "pie" substring.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
