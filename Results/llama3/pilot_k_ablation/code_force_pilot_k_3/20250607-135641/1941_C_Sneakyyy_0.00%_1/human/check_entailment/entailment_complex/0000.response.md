Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly counts the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'map' or 'pie' in a given string for multiple test cases. The program uses a while loop to iterate over the string, checking every substring of length 3. If the substring is 'map' or 'pie', it increments the answer by 1 and moves the index 3 positions forward. If the substring is not 'map' or 'pie', it moves the index 1 position forward. This ensures that the program does not count overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie'.

The program also handles the case where the string is already beautiful (i.e., does not contain 'map' or 'pie') by printing 0.

Correctness: **True**
