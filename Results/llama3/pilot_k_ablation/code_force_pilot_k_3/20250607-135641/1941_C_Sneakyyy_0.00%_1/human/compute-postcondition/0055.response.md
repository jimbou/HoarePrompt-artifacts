The code prints the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the string `a`, which is the same string input from the user.
Output: ** `a` is the same string input from the user, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `_` is 1, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `len(a) - 3`, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is equal to `ans` is being printed**
