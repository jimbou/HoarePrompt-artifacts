The code snippet provided consists of three lines that modify the variables `a`, `ans`, and `i`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

1. `a = input()`: This line assigns a new value to `a` from the input. Since the initial state of `a` is a positive integer `t`, this line overwrites that value. The new value of `a` is a string input from the user.

2. `ans = 0`: This line resets the value of `ans` to 0. Initially, `ans` was the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie', but this line sets it to 0, effectively resetting the count.

3. `i = 0`: This line resets the value of `i` to 0. Initially, `i` was `len(a) - 2`, but this line sets it to 0, effectively resetting the index.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

- `a` is a string input from the user (overwriting its initial value as a positive integer `t`).
- `ans` is 0 (reset from its initial value as the count of specific substrings).
- `i` is 0 (reset from its initial value as `len(a) - 2`).
- `_` remains 1 (as it was not modified by the code).
- `s` remains the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from the `i`th index (its value is not directly modified by the code, but its relation to `a` and `i` changes due to the modifications of `a` and `i`).

Output State: **a is a string input from the user, ans is 0, i is 0, _ is 1, and s is the last substring of length 3 in the new string a starting from index 0.**
