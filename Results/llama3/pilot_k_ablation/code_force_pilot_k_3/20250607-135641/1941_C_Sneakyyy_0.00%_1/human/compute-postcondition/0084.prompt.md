Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^6) followed by a string s of length n consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = input()
    ans = 0
    i = 0
    while i < len(a) - 2:
        s = a[i:i + 3]
        print(s)
        if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
            i += 3
            ans += 1
        else:
            i += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is a positive integer `t`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie', `_` is 0, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from the `i`th index, and the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is the same string input from the user, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `_` is 1, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `len(a) - 3`, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is equal to `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is the same string input from the user, `ans` is the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `_` is 2, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `len(a) - 3`, and the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
