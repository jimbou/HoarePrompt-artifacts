Output State: **`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 3 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, `_` is 2, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`, which is being printed, and `len(a)` must be at least 5 if `i` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`. If `i` is 3, then `s` will be the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 3. If `i` is 1, then `s` will be the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
