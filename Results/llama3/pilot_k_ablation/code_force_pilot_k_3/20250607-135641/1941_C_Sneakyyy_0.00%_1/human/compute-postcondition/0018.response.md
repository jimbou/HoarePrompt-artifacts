The variables in the loop head are `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2, 4, or 6, and `a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `len(a) - 2`, so `i` must be either 2 or 4. If `i` is 6, then `len(a)` must be greater than 8 for the loop to execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 4, or `i` is 6 and `a` has length greater than 8, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `_` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3, which is a substring of `a` starting from the `i`th index. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `i` is either 1 or 3, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and the substring `s` of `a` is being printed.**
