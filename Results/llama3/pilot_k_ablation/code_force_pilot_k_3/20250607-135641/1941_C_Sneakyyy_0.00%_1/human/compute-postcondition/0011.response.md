To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `i` and `a` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1 or 3, and `a` is a positive integer `t` with length at least 3.

To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. Since `i` is either 1 or 3, we need to adjust `a` to have a length greater than 3 + 2 = 5.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5, `i` is either 1 or 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3, which is a substring of `a` starting from the 0th index, and the substring `s` of `a` is being printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.**
