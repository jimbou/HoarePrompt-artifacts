Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 9 characters long, `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3, `i` is either 7 or 9, `_` is 1, `s` is a substring of `a` starting at index 6 and ending at index 8, and the substring `s` of `a` starting at index 6 and ending at index 8 is being printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is either 2 or 3 and `i` is 9. Otherwise, `ans` is either 1 or 2 and `i` is 7.***
