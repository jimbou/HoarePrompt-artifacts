Output State: **`a` is a positive integer `t`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie', `_` is 0, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from the `i`th index.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `a` remains unchanged as a positive integer `t`, the variable `i` reaches the second last index of `a`, the variable `ans` counts the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie', the variable `_` remains unchanged as 0, and the variable `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from the `i`th index.
