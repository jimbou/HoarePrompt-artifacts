Output State: **a is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2, ans is 2 if the first substring of length 3 in a starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise ans is 1, i is 6 if the first substring of length 3 in a starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise i is 4, _ is 2, and s is the substring of length 3 in a starting from index i.**

The code increments `i` by 3 and `ans` by 1. The value of `i` is now 6 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise it is 4. The value of `ans` is now 2 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
