To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and the input value.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, indicating that the loop has executed once. For the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented by 1.

The input value is not explicitly stated, but since `_` is 1, it means the loop has executed once, and the input value should be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `a`, `ans`, `i`, and `s` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is the same string input from the user, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `_` is 2, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `len(a) - 3`, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is equal to `ans` is being printed**
