Output State: **`a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5, `i` is either 2 or 4, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3, which is a substring of `a` starting from the `i`th index. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and the substring `s` of `a` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is now 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
