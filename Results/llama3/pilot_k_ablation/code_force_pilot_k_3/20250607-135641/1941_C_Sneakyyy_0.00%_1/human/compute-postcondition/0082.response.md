The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of substrings of length 3 in the string `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie'. Since the exact string `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of such substrings.

Output: **the number of substrings of length 3 in the string a that are either 'map' or 'pie'**
