Output State: **`a` is the same string input from the user, `ans` is the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a`, `i` is `len(a)`, `_` is `t`, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `len(a) - 3`, and the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` which is equal to `ans` is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all `t` test cases, and for each test case, it has counted the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in the input string `a`. The variable `ans` holds the total count of such occurrences, and `i` has reached the end of the string. The loop variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `s` holds the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `len(a) - 3`, which is the last substring processed by the loop. Finally, the number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'map' or 'pie' in `a` is being printed.
