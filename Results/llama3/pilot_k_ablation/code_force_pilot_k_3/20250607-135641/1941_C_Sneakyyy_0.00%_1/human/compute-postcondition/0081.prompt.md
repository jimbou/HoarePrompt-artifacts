Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is the same string input from the user, ans is 0, i is 0, _ is 2, and s is the last substring of length 3 in a starting from index len(a) - 3.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a) - 2:
    s = a[i:i + 3]
    print(s)
    if s == 'map' or s == 'pie':
        i += 3
        ans += 1
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 3 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, `_` is 2, and `s` is the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0, which is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2. If the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2, `i` is 6, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`. If the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is not 'map' or 'pie' but the current substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2, `i` is 6, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 4 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`. In all cases, `_` is 2, and the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i` is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2. If the substring `s` of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 or 2 or 1, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2 + 3`, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is 2 or 1 or 0, `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i-1`, and the substring `s` of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i-1` is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
