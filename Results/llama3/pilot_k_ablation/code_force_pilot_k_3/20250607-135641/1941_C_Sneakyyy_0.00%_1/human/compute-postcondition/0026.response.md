The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie'.

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the count of substrings that match the specified conditions.

Output: **the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie'**
