Postcondition: ***`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 3 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, `_` is 2, and `s` is the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0, which is being printed.***
