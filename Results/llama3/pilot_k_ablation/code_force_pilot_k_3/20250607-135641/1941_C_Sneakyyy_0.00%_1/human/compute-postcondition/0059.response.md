The code `s = a[i:i + 3]` assigns a new value to `s`. Since `i` is 0, `s` is now assigned the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0.

Output State: **`a` is the same string input from the user and its length must be greater than 2, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `_` is 2, and `s` is the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0.**
