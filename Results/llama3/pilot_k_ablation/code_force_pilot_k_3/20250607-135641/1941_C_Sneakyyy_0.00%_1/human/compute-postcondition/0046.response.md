According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is at least 6 characters long, `i` is 6. `a` being at least 6 characters long does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is at least 9 characters long. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is at least 9 characters long, `ans` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 6, `_` is 1**
