Output State: **a is a positive integer t with length greater than 5, i is either 4 or 6, ans is either 1 or 2, _ is 0, s is a string of length 3, which is a substring of a starting from the ith index. If s is either 'map' or 'pie', then ans is 2 and i is 6. Otherwise, ans is 1 and i is 4, and the substring s of a is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 3, so it is now either 4 or 6. The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2. The values of `a`, `_`, and `s` remain unchanged. The relationship between `s` and `ans` still holds, but the value of `i` has changed.
