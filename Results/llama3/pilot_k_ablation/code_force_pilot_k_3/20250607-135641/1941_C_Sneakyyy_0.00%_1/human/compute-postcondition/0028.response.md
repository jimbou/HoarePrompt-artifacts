To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`, which means the loop will execute as long as the input value is greater than the current iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `a` is a positive integer `t`
* `i` is `len(a) - 2`
* `ans` is the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie'
* `_` is 0
* `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from the `i`th index

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used to iterate over the range of the input value.

Since the loop will execute again if the input value is greater than the current iteration, we need to increment `_` by 1.

The other variables in the state (`a`, `i`, `ans`, and `s`) are not affected by the loop head, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a positive integer `t`, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `ans` is the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie', `_` is 1, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from the `i`th index**
