Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5, `i` is either 2, 4, or 6, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `_` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3, which is a substring of `a` starting from the `i`th index. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2 and `i` is 6. If `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' but `i` is either 1 or 3, then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 4. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 2, and the substring `s` of `a` is being printed.***
