The only objects in the loop head are variables `_` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input from stdin. If the input is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t, so it needs to be adjusted to a positive integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and `_` is 0 (since it's the first iteration).
State: **stdin contains a positive integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), `_` is 0**
