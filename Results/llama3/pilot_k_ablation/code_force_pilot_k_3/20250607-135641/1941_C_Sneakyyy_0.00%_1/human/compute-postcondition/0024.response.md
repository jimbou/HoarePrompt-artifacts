Postcondition: ***`a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5, `i` is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9, `ans` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, `_` is 0, and `s` is a string of length 3, which is a substring of `a` starting from the `i`th index, and this string `s` is being printed. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is either 5, 7, or 9, and `ans` is either 1, 2, or 3. Otherwise, `i` is either 3 or 5, or `i` is 7 and `a` has length greater than 8, and `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2.***
