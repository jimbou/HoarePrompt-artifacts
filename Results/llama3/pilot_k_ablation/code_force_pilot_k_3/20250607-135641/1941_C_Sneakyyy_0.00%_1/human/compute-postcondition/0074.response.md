According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 6 or 4 or 2, and `a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2. `i` being 6 or 4 or 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2, `ans` is 2 or 1 or 0, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2`, `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`, and `_` is 2**
