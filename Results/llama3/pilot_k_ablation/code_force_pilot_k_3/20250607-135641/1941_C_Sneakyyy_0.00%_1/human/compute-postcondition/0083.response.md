The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of substrings of length 3 in the string `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie'.
Output: **`a` is the same string input from the user, `ans` is the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie', `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `_` is 2, and `s` is the last substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `len(a) - 3`, and the number of substrings of length 3 in `a` that are either 'map' or 'pie' is being printed**
