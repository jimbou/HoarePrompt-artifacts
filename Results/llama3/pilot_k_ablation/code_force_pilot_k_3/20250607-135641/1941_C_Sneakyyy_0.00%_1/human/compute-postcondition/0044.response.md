Output State: **`a` is at least 6 characters long, `ans` is 1 if the substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0. `i` is 4 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2. `_` is 1. The substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index `i` is being printed. The substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index `i` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If the substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', the new value of `i` is 4, otherwise it is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from the new index `i` is being printed.
