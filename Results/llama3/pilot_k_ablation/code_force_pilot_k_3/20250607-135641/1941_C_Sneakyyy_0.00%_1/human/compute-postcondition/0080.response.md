Postcondition: ***`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2. If the substring `s` of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i` is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 3 or 2 or 1, `i` is less than `len(a) - 2 + 3`, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i - 3`. Otherwise, `ans` is 2 or 1 or 0, `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i-1`, and the substring `s` of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i-1` is being printed.***
