Postcondition: **`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2. If the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2, `i` is 6, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`. If the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is not 'map' or 'pie' but the current substring `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2, `i` is 6, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 4 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`. In all cases, `_` is 2, and the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i` is being printed.**
