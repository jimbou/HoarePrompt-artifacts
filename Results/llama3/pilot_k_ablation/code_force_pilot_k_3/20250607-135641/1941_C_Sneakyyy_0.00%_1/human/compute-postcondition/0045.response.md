Postcondition: **`a` is at least 6 characters long. If the substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 2, `i` is 6, and the substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index `i` is printed. Otherwise, if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' but not at index 0, then `ans` is 1, `i` is 4, and the substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index `i` is printed. In all cases, `_` is 1.**
