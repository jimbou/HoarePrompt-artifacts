Output State: **`a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5, `i` is either 3 or 5, or `i` is 7 and `a` has length greater than 8, `ans` is either 0, 1, or 2, `_` is 0, and `s` is a string of length 3, which is a substring of `a` starting from the `i`th index, and this string `s` is being printed**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it can be either 3 or 5, or 7 if `a` has length greater than 8. The other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` is still a substring of `a` starting from the `i`th index, but now `i` has been incremented, so the substring has shifted one position to the right.
