Output: **`a` is a positive integer `t` with length greater than 5, `i` is either 1 or 3, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 0, `s` is a string of length 3, which is a substring of `a` starting from the `i`th index. If `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1, and the substring `s` of `a` is being printed**
