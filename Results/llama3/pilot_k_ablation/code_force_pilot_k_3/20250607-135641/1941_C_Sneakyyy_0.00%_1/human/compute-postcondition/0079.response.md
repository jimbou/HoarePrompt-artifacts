Output State: **`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2, `ans` is 2 or 1 or 0, `i` is less than `len(a) - 1`, `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i-1`, and `_` is 2, and the substring `s` of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i-1` is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than `len(a) - 1`. The substring `s` is now the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i-1`, because `i` has been incremented. The other variables remain unchanged.
