Output State: **`a` is the same string input from the user and its length is greater than 2, `ans` is 1 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `ans` is 0, `i` is 4 if the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 2, `_` is 2, and `s` is the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`, and the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i` is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. If the first substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index 0 is either 'map' or 'pie', then `i` is now 4, otherwise it is 2. The values of `a`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is still the substring of length 3 in `a` starting from index `i`, but now `i` has a new value.
