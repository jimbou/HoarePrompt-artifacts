The code prints the substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index `i`.
Since `i` is 3 if `s` is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise `i` is 1, and `s` is either 'map' or 'pie' if `ans` is 1, otherwise `s` is not 'map' or 'pie' if `ans` is 0, we can't determine the exact value of `s` without knowing the value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the substring `s` of length 3 in the string `a` starting from index `i`.
Output: **the substring s of length 3 in the string a starting from index i (where i is 3 if s is either 'map' or 'pie', otherwise i is 1)**
