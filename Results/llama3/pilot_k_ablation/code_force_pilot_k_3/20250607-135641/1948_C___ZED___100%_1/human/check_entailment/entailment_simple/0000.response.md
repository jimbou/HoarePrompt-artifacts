Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It iterates over each test case, reading the number of columns `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the grid. It then checks for each pair of columns (starting from the second column, since the robot starts at column 1) whether there is a situation where the robot would be blocked from moving further to the right.

The condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` checks for two possible blocking scenarios:

1. If the current column `i` in the first row `a` has an arrow pointing left (`a[i] == '<'`) and the next column `i + 1` in the second row `b` also has an arrow pointing left (`b[i + 1] == '<'`), the robot would be blocked from moving further to the right.

2. If the current column `i` in the first row `a` has an arrow pointing left (`a[i] == '<'`) and the previous column `i - 1` in the second row `b` also has an arrow pointing left (`b[i - 1] == '<'`), the robot would be blocked from moving further to the right.

If either of these conditions is true, the program prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding any blocking scenarios, the program prints 'YES'.

The program correctly handles the constraints of the problem, including the even number of columns and the absence of arrows pointing outside the grid.

Correctness: **True**
