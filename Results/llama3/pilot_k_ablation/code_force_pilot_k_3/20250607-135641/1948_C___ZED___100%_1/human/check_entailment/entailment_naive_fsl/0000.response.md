Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine whether the robot can reach the cell (2, n) in all cases. 

One case where the program fails is when the input is:

4
>><<
><>>

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES". The robot can reach the cell (2, 4) by moving right from (1, 1) to (1, 2), then down to (2, 2), then right to (2, 3), and finally right to (2, 4).

The issue with the program is that it only checks for certain patterns in the arrows, but it does not consider all possible paths that the robot can take. It does not correctly simulate the movement of the robot and does not check all possible paths to the target cell.
