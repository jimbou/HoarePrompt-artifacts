The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() and j. If j is less than the input(), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input() must be greater than 0 and j is 1.
State: **j is 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a string, b is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed**
