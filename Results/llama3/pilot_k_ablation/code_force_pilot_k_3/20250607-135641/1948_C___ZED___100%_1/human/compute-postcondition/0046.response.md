The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i + 2 < n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 2 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, and `stdin` is empty.**
