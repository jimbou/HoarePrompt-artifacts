Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `i` is 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` do not change. The code only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin is still empty. 'NO' is still being printed.
