Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If `i + 1` is less than `n` and `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<', then the string 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
