Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: j is 1, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('NO')
        break
else:
    print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty. If the current value of `i` plus one is less than `n`, and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<', then 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without printing 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
