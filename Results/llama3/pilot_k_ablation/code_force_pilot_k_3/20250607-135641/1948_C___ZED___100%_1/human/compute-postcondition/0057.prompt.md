Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and/or '>', where n is even.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = input()
    b = input()
    for i in range(1, n, 2):
        if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
            print('NO')
            break
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: j is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a string, b is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `j` is 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd and `n` if `n` is even, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty. If the loop did not break, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `j` is 2, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd and `n` if `n` is even, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
