The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty.**
