Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd and `n` if `n` is even, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty. If the loop did not break, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop finishes executing, the value of `i` will be the last index that was processed in the loop, which depends on whether `n` is odd or even. The values of `j`, `a`, `b`, and stdin remain unchanged. If the loop did not encounter any pair of '<' characters that caused it to break, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the loop completed successfully. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that the loop encountered a pair of '<' characters that caused it to break.
