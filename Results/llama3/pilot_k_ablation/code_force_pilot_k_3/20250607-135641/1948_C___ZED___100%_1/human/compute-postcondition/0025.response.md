Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed. The current value of `i` plus one is less than `n`, and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<', and 'NO' is printed. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty. The conditions regarding the characters at specific indices in `a` and `b` and the printing of 'NO' or 'YES' are still valid. The only change is that the program will now exit the innermost loop or if statement it was in.
