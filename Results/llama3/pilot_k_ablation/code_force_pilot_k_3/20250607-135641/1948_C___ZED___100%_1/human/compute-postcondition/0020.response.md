Output State: **j is 1, n is an integer, a is a string, b is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed**

In this output state, the value of `j` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the strings read from the input. The stdin is empty after reading the inputs. The output state also includes the possibility of either 'NO' or 'YES' being printed, as specified in the initial state.
