To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1 (since the range starts from 1 and increments by 2). Before the loop starts, `j` is 1, but this does not guarantee the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 1, and `i` should be initialized to 1 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`j` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed**
