The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i + 2` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 3. So for the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 2 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3**
