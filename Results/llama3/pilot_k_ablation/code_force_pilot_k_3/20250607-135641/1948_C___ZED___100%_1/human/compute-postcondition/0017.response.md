Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, and `stdin` is empty. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
