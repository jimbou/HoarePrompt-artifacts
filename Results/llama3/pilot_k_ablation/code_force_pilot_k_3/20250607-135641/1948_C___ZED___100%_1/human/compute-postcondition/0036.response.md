Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'NO' is printed and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
