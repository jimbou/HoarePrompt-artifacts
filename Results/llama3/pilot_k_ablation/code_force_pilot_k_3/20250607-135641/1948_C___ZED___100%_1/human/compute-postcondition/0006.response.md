Output State: **`j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. The current value of `i + 1` is less than `n`. The current value of `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or the current value of `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<'. The string 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions `i + 1` is less than `n`, `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both equal to '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both equal to '<' are still valid. Additionally, the string 'NO' is still being printed, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
