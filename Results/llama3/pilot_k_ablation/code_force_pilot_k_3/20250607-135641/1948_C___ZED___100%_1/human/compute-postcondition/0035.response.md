The code `break` is executed. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The values of `j`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b` remain the same. stdin is still empty. 'NO' is still being printed. 
Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
