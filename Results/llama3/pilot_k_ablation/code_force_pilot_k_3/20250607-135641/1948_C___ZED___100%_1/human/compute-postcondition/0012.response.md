Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
