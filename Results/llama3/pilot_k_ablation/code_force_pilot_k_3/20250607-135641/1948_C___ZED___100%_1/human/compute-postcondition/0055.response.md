Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `i` is 5, `a` is a string, `b` is a string. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
