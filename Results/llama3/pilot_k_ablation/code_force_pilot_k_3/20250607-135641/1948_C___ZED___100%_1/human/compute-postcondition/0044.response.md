Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The condition that the current value of `i` plus one is less than `n` is still valid, and the condition that either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<', and 'NO' is printed is still true.
