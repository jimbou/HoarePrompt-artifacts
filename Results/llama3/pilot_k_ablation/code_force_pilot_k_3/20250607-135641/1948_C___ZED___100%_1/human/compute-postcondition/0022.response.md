Postcondition: **`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty, and either 'NO' is printed or 'YES' is printed. The current value of `i` plus one is less than `n`, and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<'.**
