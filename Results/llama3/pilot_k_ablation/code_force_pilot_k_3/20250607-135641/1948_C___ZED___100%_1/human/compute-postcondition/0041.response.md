Postcondition: ***`j` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `i` plus one is less than `n`, and either the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<'.***
