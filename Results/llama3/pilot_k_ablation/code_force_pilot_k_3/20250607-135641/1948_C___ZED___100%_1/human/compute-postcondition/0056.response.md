Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd and `n` if `n` is even, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `j`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` as in the initial state. The value of `n` will remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop. The value of `i` will be either `n-1` if `n` is odd or `n` if `n` is even, as it is initialized before the loop. Additionally, either 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed to the console, depending on whether the loop completed all its iterations without finding a pair of '<' characters in the specified positions in strings `a` and `b`.
