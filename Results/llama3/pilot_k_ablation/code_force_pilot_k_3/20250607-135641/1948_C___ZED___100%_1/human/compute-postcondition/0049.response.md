The code `break` is executed. This statement breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. The values of the variables `j`, `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this statement. However, the printing of 'NO' is stopped.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `i` is 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
