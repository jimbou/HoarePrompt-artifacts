Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a string, `b` is a string, stdin is empty. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
