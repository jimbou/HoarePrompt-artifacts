Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `ele` is less than 0 and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.***
