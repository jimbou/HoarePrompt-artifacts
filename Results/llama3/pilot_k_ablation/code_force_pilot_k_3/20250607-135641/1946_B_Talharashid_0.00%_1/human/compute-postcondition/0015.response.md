The value of `c` is increased by the value of `ele`, which is the third element in the list `l`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is 0, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.

Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
