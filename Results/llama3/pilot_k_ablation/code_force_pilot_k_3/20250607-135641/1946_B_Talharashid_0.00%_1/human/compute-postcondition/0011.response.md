Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by the second element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` is increased by the second element in the list `l`, which is the current value of `ele`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.
