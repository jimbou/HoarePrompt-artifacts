Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates a value for each test case by iterating through the integers, updating a maximum value and a cumulative sum based on certain conditions. Finally, it prints the result of an expression involving the maximum value, the cumulative sum, and the input integers, modulo 1000000007, for each test case.**
