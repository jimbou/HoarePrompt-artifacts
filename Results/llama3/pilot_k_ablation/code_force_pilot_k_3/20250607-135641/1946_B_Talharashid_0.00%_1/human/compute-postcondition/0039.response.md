The code prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and their values:

*   `n` and `k` are integers, but their values are not used in the expression.
*   `l` is an empty list, so `sum(l)` is 0.
*   `i` is 1, but its value is not used in the expression.
*   `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and 0. Since the previous value is not specified, we can assume that `maxi` is 0.
*   `c` is 0, but its value is not used in the expression.

Now, let's evaluate the expression:

*   `2 ** k` is 2 raised to the power of `k`, but since `k` is an integer, this expression will always result in an integer.
*   `maxi` is 0, so `2 ** k * maxi` is 0.
*   `maxi` is 0, so `- maxi` is 0.
*   `sum(l)` is 0, since `l` is an empty list.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to `(0 + 0 + 0) % 1000000007`, which is 0.

Output: **0**
