Output State: **n and k are integers, l is a list of integers, i is 2, maxi is 0, c is 0, and this is printed: (2**

The code block consists of four lines. The first line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `l`. The third line initializes `c` to 0, and the fourth line initializes `maxi` to 0.

After executing the entire code block, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input integers, `l` is updated to the list of input integers, and `c` and `maxi` are initialized to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the print statement remains the same. The stdin is now empty since all inputs have been read.
