Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list of integers, `c` is the sum of all positive elements in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `maxi` is the maximum of the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements and also greater than or equal to `c`, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
