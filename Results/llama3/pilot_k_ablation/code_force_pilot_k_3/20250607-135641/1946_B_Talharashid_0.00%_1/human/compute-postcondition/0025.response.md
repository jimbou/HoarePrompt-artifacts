The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `c` is 0 and `maxi` is also 0, `maxi` remains 0. The second line assigns 0 to `c`, which means `c` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, ele is the first element in the list l, the current value of ele is less than 0, and the current value of c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele.**
