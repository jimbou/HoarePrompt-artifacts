To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the components of the expression inside the `print` statement based on the given initial state:

1. `2 ** k`: This is the result of raising 2 to the power of `k`, where `k` is an integer. Without knowing the exact value of `k`, we can't compute this exactly, but it represents a power of 2.

2. `maxi`: This is the maximum of 0 and the original value of `maxi`. Since `maxi` is compared to 0, and without knowing its original value, we can say `maxi` is at least 0 or more, depending on its original value.

3. `sum(l)`: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` is 0.

4. The entire expression is then taken modulo 1000000007. This means the final result will be the remainder when the result of the entire expression is divided by 1000000007.

Putting it all together, the expression simplifies to `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + 0) % 1000000007`. Since `sum(l)` is 0, it doesn't contribute to the sum. The expression further simplifies to `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi) % 1000000007`.

Without knowing the exact values of `k` and `maxi`, we can't compute the exact numerical result. However, we can describe what will be printed based on the given information.

Output: **((2 to the power of k) * maxi - maxi) modulo 1000000007 (where k is an integer and maxi is at least 0 or more, depending on its original value)**
