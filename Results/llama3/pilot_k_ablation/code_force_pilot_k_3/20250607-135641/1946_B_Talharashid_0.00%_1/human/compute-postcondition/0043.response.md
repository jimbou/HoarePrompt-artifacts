According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the states are: n and k are integers, i is 2, maxi is 0, c is 0, and this is printed: (2. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the ele is the first element in the list.
State: **n and k are integers, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, i is 2, maxi is 0, c is 0, ele is the first element in the list, and this is printed: (2**
