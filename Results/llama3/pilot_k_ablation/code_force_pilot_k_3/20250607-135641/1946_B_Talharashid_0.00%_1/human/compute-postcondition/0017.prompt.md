Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original value of `maxi` and the absolute value of `ele`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0 and `c` is the sum of 0 and the first element in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the second element in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
