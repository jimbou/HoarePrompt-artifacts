Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`.***
