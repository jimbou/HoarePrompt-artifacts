Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If the current value of `ele` is less than 0 and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is either 0 or more than 0. `c` is increased by the value of `ele`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `maxi`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ele` is still the second element in the list `l`. The value of `c` is increased by the value of `ele`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` becomes 0. Otherwise, `c` is either 0 or more than 0.
