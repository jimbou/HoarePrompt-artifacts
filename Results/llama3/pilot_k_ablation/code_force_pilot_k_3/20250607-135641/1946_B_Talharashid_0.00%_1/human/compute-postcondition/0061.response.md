Output State: **The loop has executed for all test cases in the input, and the final output state is the last calculated value of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for the last test case.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has processed all test cases in the input, and the final output is the result of the last calculation of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` for the last test case. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, `maxi`, and `i` are updated accordingly after processing each test case, and the final output is the result of the last calculation.
