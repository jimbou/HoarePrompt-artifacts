The only variable in the loop head is variable  ele and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, list l has at least 2 elements, ele is the second element in the list l. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the ele is the third element in the list.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**
