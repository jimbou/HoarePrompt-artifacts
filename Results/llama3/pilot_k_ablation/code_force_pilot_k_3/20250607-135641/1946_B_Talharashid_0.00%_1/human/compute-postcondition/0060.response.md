Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the original value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0, and this is printed: (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007, which is equal to (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + 0) % 1000000007, since sum(l) is 0 because l is an empty list**
