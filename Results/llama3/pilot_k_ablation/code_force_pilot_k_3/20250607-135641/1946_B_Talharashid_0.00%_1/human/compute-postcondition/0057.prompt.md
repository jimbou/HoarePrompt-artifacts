Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and k are integers, l is a list of integers, i is 2, maxi is 0, c is 0, and this is printed: (2
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n and k are integers, l is a list of integers with at least 1 element, i is 2, maxi is the maximum of the original value of maxi and the original value of c, c is either 0 or c + ele, ele is the first element in the list, and either the current value of ele is less than 0 and the current value of c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, or ele is not less than 0 or c is more than the absolute value of ele.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value of `maxi` and the original value of `c`, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is either `c` + `ele` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele`, or `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele` if `ele` is less than 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` and `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value of `maxi` and the original value of `c`, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is either `c` + `ele` or `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
