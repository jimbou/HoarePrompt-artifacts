Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list of integers, `c` is the sum of all positive elements in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `maxi` is the maximum of the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `l` will be empty because the loop iterates over each element in the list. The variable `c` will hold the sum of all positive elements in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements. The variable `maxi` will hold the maximum of the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin will still contain at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers.
