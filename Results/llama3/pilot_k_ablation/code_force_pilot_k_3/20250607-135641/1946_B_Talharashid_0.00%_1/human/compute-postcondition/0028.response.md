Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`. If the current value of `ele` is less than 0 and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is either 0 or more than 0.***
