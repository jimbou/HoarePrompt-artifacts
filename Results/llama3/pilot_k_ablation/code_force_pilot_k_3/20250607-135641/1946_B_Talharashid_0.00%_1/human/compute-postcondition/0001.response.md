Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers**

The code reads two space-separated integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. It then reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. The variables `c` and `maxi` are initialized to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains at least 1 test case minus the two inputs that were read.
