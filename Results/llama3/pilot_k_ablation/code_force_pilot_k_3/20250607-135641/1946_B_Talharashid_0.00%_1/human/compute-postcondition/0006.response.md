Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the sum of 0 and the first element in the list `l`, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` is updated to be the sum of its initial value (0) and the first element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The condition that either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele` is still valid.
