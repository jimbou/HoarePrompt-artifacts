Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the maximum cumulative sum of positive elements in `l` that is reset to 0 whenever a negative element is encountered and the cumulative sum is less than or equal to the absolute value of the negative element, `c` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same integer values for `n` and `k`, an empty list `l` since all elements have been processed, and `i` remains 1 as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `maxi` will hold the maximum cumulative sum of positive elements encountered in the list `l`, which is reset to 0 whenever a negative element is encountered and the current cumulative sum is less than or equal to the absolute value of the negative element. The variable `c` will be 0, as it is either reset to 0 when a negative element is encountered and the cumulative sum is less than or equal to the absolute value of the negative element, or it will be 0 after processing all elements in the list.
