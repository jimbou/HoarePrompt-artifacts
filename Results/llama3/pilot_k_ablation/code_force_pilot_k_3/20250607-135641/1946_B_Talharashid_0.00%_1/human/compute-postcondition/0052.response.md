Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value of `maxi` and the original value of `c`, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is either `c` + `ele` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele`, or `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele` if `ele` is less than 0.***
