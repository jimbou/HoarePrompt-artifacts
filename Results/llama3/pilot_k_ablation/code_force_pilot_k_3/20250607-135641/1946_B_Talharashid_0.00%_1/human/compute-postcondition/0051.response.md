Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value of `maxi` and the original value of `c`, `c` is either `c` + `ele` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is more than the absolute value of `ele`, or `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele` if `ele` is less than 0, and `ele` is the second element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `maxi` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is updated by adding the value of `ele` to it. If `ele` is non-negative or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` becomes `c` + `ele`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` becomes less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`. The value of `ele` remains the same as the second element in the list.
