The value of `c` is increased by `ele`, where `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `l` still has at least 3 elements. The variable `i` is still 1. The variables `n` and `k` are still integers.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`, `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`.**
