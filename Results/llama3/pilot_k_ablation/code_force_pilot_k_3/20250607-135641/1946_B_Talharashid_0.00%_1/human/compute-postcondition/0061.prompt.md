Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains several test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list of integers, `c` is the sum of all positive elements in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements, `maxi` is undefined, `i` is 0, and the result of the expression `(2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and 0, `c` is 0, and this is printed: (2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the original value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0, and this is printed: (2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
