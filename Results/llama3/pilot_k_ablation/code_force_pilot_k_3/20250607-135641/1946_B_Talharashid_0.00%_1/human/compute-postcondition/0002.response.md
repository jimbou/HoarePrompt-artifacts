To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: two space-separated integers and a space-separated list of integers**
