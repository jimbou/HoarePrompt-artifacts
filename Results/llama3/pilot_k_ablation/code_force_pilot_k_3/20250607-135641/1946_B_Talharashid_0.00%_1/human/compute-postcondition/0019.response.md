The code prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the variables and objects involved:

*   `k` is an integer.
*   `maxi` is the maximum of the absolute values of all negative elements in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of the previous positive elements and also greater than or equal to `c`. Since `l` is an empty list, `maxi` will be 0 (or a default value if no such elements exist, but based on the given information, it will be 0).
*   `sum(l)` is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` will be 0.

Given these values, the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` simplifies to `(2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007`, which further simplifies to `0 % 1000000007`, resulting in `0`.

Output: **0**
