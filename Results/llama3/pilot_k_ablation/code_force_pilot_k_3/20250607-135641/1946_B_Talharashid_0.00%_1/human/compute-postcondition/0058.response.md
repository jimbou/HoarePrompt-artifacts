Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the original value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only change is in the value of `maxi`, which is now the maximum of 0 and its original value. This is because the code `maxi = max(c, maxi)` updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of the current value of `c` (which is 0) and the original value of `maxi`.
