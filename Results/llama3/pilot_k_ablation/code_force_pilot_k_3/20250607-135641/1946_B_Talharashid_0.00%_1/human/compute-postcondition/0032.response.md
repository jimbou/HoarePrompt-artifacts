Postcondition: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `ele` is the second element in the list `l`. If the current value of `ele` is less than 0 and the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi` and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is 0 and `c` is either 0 or more than 0 and increased by the value of `ele`.**
