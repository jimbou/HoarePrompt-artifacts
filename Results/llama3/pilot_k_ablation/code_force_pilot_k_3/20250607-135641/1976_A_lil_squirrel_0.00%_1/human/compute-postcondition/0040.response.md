To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ch` and `password`. 

Since `ch` is the first character in the password at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `ch` must be the next character in the password. 

Also, since `password` must have at least 1 character at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `password` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string that must have at least 2 characters, results is a list containing 'YES', ch is the second character in the password. If ch is a letter, then letters is a string containing the first character of password which is a letter and the second character of password which is a letter and digits is an empty string. If ch is not a letter, then letters is a string containing the first character of password which is a letter and digits is an empty string if ch is not a digit, otherwise digits is a string that contains at least 1 digit.**
