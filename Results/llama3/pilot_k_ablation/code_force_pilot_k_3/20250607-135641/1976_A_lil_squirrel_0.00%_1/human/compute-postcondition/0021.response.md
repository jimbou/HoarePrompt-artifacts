Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, password is an empty string, letters is a string consisting of all the letters in password, and digits is a string consisting of all the digits in password.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables not affected by the loop remains unchanged. The loop iterates over each character in the password string. If the character is a letter, it is appended to the letters string. If the character is a digit, it is appended to the digits string. After all iterations, the letters string contains all the letters in the password string, and the digits string contains all the digits in the password string.
