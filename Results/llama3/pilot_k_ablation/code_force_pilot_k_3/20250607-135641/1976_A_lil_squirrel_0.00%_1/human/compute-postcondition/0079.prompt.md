Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO', letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string that must have at least 1 character, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'. If the first character of the password is a letter, then letters is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter, and digits is an empty string. If the first character of the password is a digit, then digits is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit, and letters is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'. If the first character of the password is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch` if `ch` is a letter, otherwise `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter. If the first character of the password is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'. If the first character of the password is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch` if `ch` is a letter, otherwise `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter and the third character of the password. If the first character of the password is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit and the third character in the `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is updated to include `ch`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
