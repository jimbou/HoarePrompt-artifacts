Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `test_cases` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify them. The code creates a new variable `results` and assigns it an empty list.
