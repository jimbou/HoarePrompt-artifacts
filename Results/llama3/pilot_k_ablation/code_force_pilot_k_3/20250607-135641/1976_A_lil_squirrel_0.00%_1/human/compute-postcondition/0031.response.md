Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string, results is a list containing 'YES'**.

The code snippet resets the values of `letters` and `digits` to empty strings. Since `letters` and `digits` are now empty, the conditions for `results` being 'NO' are not met. Therefore, `results` remains a list containing 'YES'. All other variables remain unchanged.
