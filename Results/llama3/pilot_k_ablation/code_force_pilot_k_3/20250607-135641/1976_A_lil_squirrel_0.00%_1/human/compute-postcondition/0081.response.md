The code snippet consists of two lines: `results.append('NO')` and `continue`. The first line appends the string 'NO' to the end of the `results` list. The second line, `continue`, is a control flow statement that skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect in this context.

Given the initial state, we know that `results` is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'. After executing the first line, 'NO' is appended to the end of the `results` list, making it ['YES', 'NO', 'NO'].

The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits`) are not affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is an empty string, results is a list containing 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', letters is a string containing all the letters in the password, digits is a string containing all the digits in the password. The current value of letters is not sorted or the current value of digits is not sorted.**
