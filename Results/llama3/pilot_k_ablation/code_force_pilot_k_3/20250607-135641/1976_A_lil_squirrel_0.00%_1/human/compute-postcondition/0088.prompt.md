Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for n, password in test_cases:
    letters = ''
    digits = ''
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isalpha():
            letters += ch
        elif ch.isdigit():
            digits += ch
    if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(
        digits[0]):
        results.append('NO')
    else:
        results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, n is a positive integer, password is a string, letters is a string consisting of all the letters in password and is sorted in ascending order, digits is a string consisting of all the digits in password and is sorted in ascending order. If the current value of letters is not sorted in ascending order or the current value of digits is not sorted in ascending order, results is a list containing 'NO'. If letters and digits are not empty and the last character of letters appears after the first character of digits in password, results is a list containing 'NO'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO', letters is a string containing all the letters in the password, digits is a string containing all the digits in the password. If the last letter in the letters string appears after the first digit in the password string, then 'NO' is added to the results list. Otherwise, if either letters or digits or both are empty or the index of the last letter in the password is less than or equal to the index of the first digit in the password, then 'YES' is added to the results list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, n is a positive integer. If the password contains letters and digits and the last letter appears after the first digit, then password is a string containing letters and digits and results is a list containing 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'NO'. Otherwise, either the password does not contain letters or digits, or the last letter in the password is not after the first digit in the password, then password is an empty string and results is a list containing 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
