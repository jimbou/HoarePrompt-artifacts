Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `results` is a list containing 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'. Either the password does not contain letters or digits, or the last letter in the password is not after the first digit in the password.**

The code appends 'YES' to the `results` list, which now contains 'YES', 'NO', 'NO', 'YES'. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the password not containing letters or digits, or the last letter not being after the first digit, is still valid.
