Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `results` is a list containing 'YES', 'YES', `letters` is a string containing all the letters in the password, `digits` is a string containing all the digits in the password. Either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty or the index of the last letter in the password is less than or equal to the index of the first digit in the password.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits` remains the same as in the initial state. However, the `results` list now contains two 'YES' values. The conditions regarding the emptiness or order of `letters` and `digits` in the password also remain unchanged.
