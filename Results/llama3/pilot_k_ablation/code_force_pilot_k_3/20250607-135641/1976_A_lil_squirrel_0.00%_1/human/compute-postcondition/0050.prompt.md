Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string, results is a list containing 'YES'
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string that must have at least 1 character, results is a list containing 'YES', ch is the first character in the password. If ch is a letter, then letters is a string containing the first character of password which is a letter and digits is an empty string. If ch is not a letter, then letters and digits are empty strings if ch is not a digit, otherwise digits is a string that contains at least 1 digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `ch` is the second character in the password. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter, the second character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter and `digits` is a string that contains at least 1 digit which is the second character of the password. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter and the second character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `ch` is the third character in the password. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter, the second character of `password` which is a letter, and the third character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter and the second character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is a string that contains at least 1 digit which is the third character of the password and has been appended with the third character of the password. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter, the second character of `password` which is a letter, and the third character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is an empty string.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
