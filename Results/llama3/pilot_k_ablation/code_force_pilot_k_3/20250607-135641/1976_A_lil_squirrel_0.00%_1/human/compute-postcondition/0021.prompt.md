Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the password is a letter, then letters is a string consisting of the first character of password which is a letter, and digits is an empty string. If the first character of the password is a digit, then letters is an empty string, and digits is a string consisting of at least 1 digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 2 characters, `ch` is the second character of `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of `password` if it's a letter, or an empty string if it's a digit, followed by the second character of `password`, and `digits` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit if the first character of `password` is a digit, or an empty string if it's a letter. If `ch` is a digit, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of `password` if it's a letter, or an empty string if it's a digit, and `digits` is a string consisting of at least 2 digits if the first character of `password` is a digit, or a string consisting of the second character of `password` if the first character of `password` is a letter.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character of `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of `password` if it's a letter, or an empty string if it's a digit, followed by the second character of `password`, the third character of `password`, and `ch`, and `digits` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit if the first character of `password` is a digit, or an empty string if it's a letter. If `ch` is a digit, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of `password` if it's a letter, or an empty string if it's a digit, and the second character of `password` if it's a letter, and `digits` is a string consisting of at least 2 digits if the first character of `password` is a digit, or a string consisting of the second character of `password` and the third character of `password` if the first character of `password` is a letter.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
