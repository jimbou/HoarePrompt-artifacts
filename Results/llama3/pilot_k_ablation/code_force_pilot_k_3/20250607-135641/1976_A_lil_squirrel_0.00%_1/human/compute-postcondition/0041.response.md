Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `ch` is the second character in the password. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter, the second character of `password` which is a letter, and `ch` which is a letter, and `digits` is an empty string. If `ch` is not a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter and the second character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is a string that contains at least 1 digit if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` has been updated to include the second character of the `password` which is stored in `ch`. If `ch` is a letter, it is appended to `letters`, and if `ch` is not a letter, `letters` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables remain the same.
