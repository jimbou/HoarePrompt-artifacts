Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'. If the first character of the password is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch` if `ch` is a letter, otherwise `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter and the third character of the password. If the first character of the password is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit, `ch` is the third character in the `password`.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` has been updated by appending the character `ch` to it, but only if the first character of the password is a letter and `ch` is also a letter. If the first character of the password is a digit, the value of `digits` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
