Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO', letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, each assigning an empty string to the variables `letters` and `digits`, respectively. As a result, the values of `letters` and `digits` are reset to empty strings. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values as specified in the precondition.
