Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is an empty string, results is a list containing 'YES', 'NO', letters is a string containing all the letters in the password, digits is a string containing all the digits in the password. The current value of letters is not sorted or the current value of digits is not sorted.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `results.append('NO')` and `continue`. The first line appends the string 'NO' to the list `results`, which initially contains 'YES'. The second line, `continue`, does not affect any variables but skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged except for the list `results`, which now contains both 'YES' and 'NO'. The other variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `password`, `letters`, and `digits`) retain their initial values and properties as described in the precondition.
