Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is an empty string, results is a list containing 'YES', letters is a string containing all the letters in the password, digits is a string containing all the digits in the password.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, and `results` as in the initial state. The `password` variable will be an empty string since the loop iterates over each character in the password. The `letters` variable will contain all the letters in the password, and the `digits` variable will contain all the digits in the password.
