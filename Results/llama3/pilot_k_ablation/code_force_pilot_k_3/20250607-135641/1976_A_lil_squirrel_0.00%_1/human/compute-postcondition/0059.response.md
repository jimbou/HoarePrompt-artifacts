According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO', letters is a string containing all the letters in the password, digits is a string containing all the digits in the password. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 tuples.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO', letters is a string containing all the letters in the password, digits is a string containing all the digits in the password.**
