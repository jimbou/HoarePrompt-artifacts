The only objects in the loop head are variables  n, password and list  test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 2 tuples the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 1 tuple, n is a positive integer, password is a string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 tuples and the n and password are the values of the second tuple in the list.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, n is a positive integer, password is a string, letters is a string consisting of all the letters in password and is sorted in ascending order, digits is a string consisting of all the digits in password and is sorted in ascending order. If the current value of letters is not sorted in ascending order or the current value of digits is not sorted in ascending order, results is a list containing 'NO'. If letters and digits are not empty and the last character of letters appears after the first character of digits in password, results is a list containing 'NO'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES'.**
