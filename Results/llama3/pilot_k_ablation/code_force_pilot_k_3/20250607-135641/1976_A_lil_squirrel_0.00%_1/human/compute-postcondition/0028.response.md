Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `n` is a positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in `password`, and `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in `password`. If the current value of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the current value of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, `results` is a list containing 'NO' and 'YES'. Either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the index of the last character of `letters` in `password` is less than or equal to the index of the first character of `digits` in `password`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `results` now contains the string 'YES', in addition to any previous values it may have had (including 'NO' if the conditions for `letters` and `digits` were not met). All other variables remain unchanged.
