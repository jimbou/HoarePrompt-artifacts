Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in `password` and is sorted in ascending order, `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in `password` and is sorted in ascending order, the last character of `letters` appears after the first character of `digits` in `password`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer, the list of test cases remains unchanged, the list of results now contains the string 'NO', the value of `n` remains a positive integer, the password remains the same string, the letters and digits in the password remain sorted in ascending order, and the last character of the letters still appears after the first character of the digits in the password.
