According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password. If the password has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string. So for the loop to be executed  the password must have at least 1 character and the ch is the first character in the password.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 character, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string, ch is the first character in the password**
