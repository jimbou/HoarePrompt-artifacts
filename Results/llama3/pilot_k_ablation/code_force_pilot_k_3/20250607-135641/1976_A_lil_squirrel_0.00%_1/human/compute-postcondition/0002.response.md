Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 1 tuple, results is an empty list, n is a positive integer, password is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `letters` and `digits`, both as empty strings. It does not modify any of the existing variables (`t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, `password`) or their values. Therefore, the state of these variables remains unchanged from the initial state. The introduction of `letters` and `digits` as empty strings is the only change to the state.
