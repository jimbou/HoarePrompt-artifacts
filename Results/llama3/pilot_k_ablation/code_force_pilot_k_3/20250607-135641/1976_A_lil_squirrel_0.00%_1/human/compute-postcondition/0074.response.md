The only variable in the loop head is variable  `ch` and `password`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`.  If the `password` has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `password` has at least 2 characters. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `password` must have at least 3 characters and the `ch` is the third character in the `password`.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'. If the first character of the password is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch` if `ch` is a letter, otherwise `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter. If the first character of the password is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit, `ch` is the third character in the `password`.**
