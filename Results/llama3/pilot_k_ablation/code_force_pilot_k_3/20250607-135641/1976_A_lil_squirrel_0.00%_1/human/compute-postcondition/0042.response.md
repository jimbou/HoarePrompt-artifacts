Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `ch` is the second character in the password. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of password which is a letter and the second character of password which is a letter and `digits` is a string that contains at least 1 digit which is the second character of the password. If `ch` is not a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of password which is a letter and `digits` is a string that contains at least 1 digit which is the second character of the password.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `password`, `results`, and `ch` remain unchanged. However, the value of `digits` has been updated. If `ch` is a letter, then `digits` now contains at least 1 digit which is the second character of the password. If `ch` is not a letter, then `digits` now contains at least 1 digit which is the second character of the password. The value of `letters` remains unchanged in both cases.
