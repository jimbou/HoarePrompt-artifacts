Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 3 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO'. If the first character of the password is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch`, and `digits` is an empty string. If the first character of the password is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password which is a digit, and `letters` is a string containing the character `ch` if `ch` is a letter, otherwise `letters` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` has been updated by appending the character `ch` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `test_cases` must have at least 3 tuples, `password` must have at least 2 characters, and `results` must contain 'YES' and 'NO' still holds true. The value of `ch` is not specified, so its impact on `letters` and `digits` is described based on whether it is a letter or a digit.
