Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `results` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character of `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of `password` if it's a letter, or an empty string if it's a digit, followed by the second character of `password` and the third character of `password`, and `digits` is a string consisting of at least 1 digit if the first character of `password` is a digit, or an empty string if it's a letter. If `ch` is a digit, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of `password` if it's a letter, or an empty string if it's a digit, and the second character of `password` if it's a letter, and `digits` is a string consisting of at least 2 digits if the first character of `password` is a digit, or a string consisting of the second character of `password` and the third character of `password` if the first character of `password` is a letter.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `digits` variable has been updated to include the third character of the `password` string, which is stored in the `ch` variable. The other variables remain unchanged.
