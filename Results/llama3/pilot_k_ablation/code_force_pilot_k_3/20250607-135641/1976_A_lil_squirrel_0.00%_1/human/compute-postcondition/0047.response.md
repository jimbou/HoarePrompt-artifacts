Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains a positive integer and a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits and must have at least 2 tuples, `n` is a positive integer, `password` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `results` is a list containing 'YES', `ch` is the third character in the password. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter, the second character of `password` which is a letter, and the third character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is an empty string. If `ch` is a digit, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter and the second character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is a string that contains at least 1 digit which is the third character of the password. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then `letters` is a string containing the first character of `password` which is a letter, the second character of `password` which is a letter, and the third character of `password` which is a letter, and `digits` is an empty string. `digits` has been appended with the third character of the password.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `n`, `password`, `results`, and `ch` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `letters` and `digits` depends on the type of the third character of the password. If the third character is a letter, then `letters` contains the first three characters of the password and `digits` is an empty string. If the third character is a digit, then `letters` contains the first two characters of the password and `digits` contains the third character of the password. If the third character is neither a letter nor a digit, then `letters` contains the first three characters of the password and `digits` is an empty string. In all cases, `digits` has been appended with the third character of the password.
