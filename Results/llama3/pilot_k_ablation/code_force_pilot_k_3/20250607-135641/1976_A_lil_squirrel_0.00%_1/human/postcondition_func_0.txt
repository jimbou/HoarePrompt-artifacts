This function evaluates a list of password test cases and returns a list of 'YES' or 'NO' values indicating whether each password meets certain conditions. The conditions are: (1) all letters in the password are in ascending order, (2) all digits in the password are in ascending order, and (3) the last letter in the password comes before the first digit. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 'NO' for that test case; otherwise, it returns 'YES'.
