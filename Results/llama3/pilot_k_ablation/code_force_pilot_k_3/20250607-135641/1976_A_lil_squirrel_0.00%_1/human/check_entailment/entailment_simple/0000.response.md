Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first separates the letters and digits from the password and stores them in separate strings.

2. It then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and moves on to the next test case.

3. If the letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. This is done by checking if the last letter appears before the first digit in the password. If such a digit is found, it appends 'NO' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits, as the conditions for a strong password are still satisfied in these cases.

5. The program returns a list of 'YES' and 'NO' values, where 'YES' indicates that the corresponding password is strong and 'NO' indicates that it is not.

Correctness: **True**
