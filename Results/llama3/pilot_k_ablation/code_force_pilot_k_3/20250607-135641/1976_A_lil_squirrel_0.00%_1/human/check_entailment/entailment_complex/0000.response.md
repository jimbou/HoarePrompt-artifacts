Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1. The program first separates the letters and digits in the password into two separate strings, `letters` and `digits`.

2. It then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in ascending order. If not, it appends 'NO' to the `results` list and moves on to the next test case.

3. If the letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. It does this by checking if the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit. If this condition is met, it appends 'NO' to the `results` list. Otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits, as the conditions for a strong password are still met in these cases.

5. The program also correctly handles the case where the password is empty, as the conditions for a strong password are still met in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password and returns the correct results for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
