Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly check if there is a digit that comes after a letter. The current implementation only checks if the last letter appears before the first digit in the password, which is not sufficient. 

For example, the password "a1b2" would be incorrectly classified as "YES" because the last letter 'b' appears after the first digit '1', but the program only checks if the last letter 'b' appears before the first digit '1', which is true.

To fix this, the program should check if any digit appears after any letter in the password. This can be done by iterating through the password and checking if a digit appears after a letter. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for (n, password) in test_cases:
        letters = ''
        digits = ''
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                letters += ch
            elif ch.isdigit():
                digits += ch
        if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
            results.append('NO')
            continue
        has_letter = False
        for ch in password:
            if ch.isalpha():
                has_letter = True
            elif ch.isdigit() and has_letter:
                results.append('NO')
                break
        else:
            results.append('YES')
    return results
```

This corrected version of the program checks if any digit appears after any letter in the password, and correctly classifies the password as "NO" if this condition is met.
