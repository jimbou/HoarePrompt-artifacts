Postcondition: ***`t` is 3, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is greater than 2, `aOnes` is either the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` plus 1 or the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` plus 2, and `bOnes` is either the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` plus 1 or the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` plus 2. If `aOnes` < `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` plus 2 and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` plus 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` plus 1 and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` plus 2.***
