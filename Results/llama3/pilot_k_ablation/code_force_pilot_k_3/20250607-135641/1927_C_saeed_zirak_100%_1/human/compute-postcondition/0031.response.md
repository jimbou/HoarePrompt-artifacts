Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to k. If `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
