Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2. If `i` is in `a`, then `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 2. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
