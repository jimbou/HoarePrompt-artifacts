Output: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` if `leftOnes` is even. Otherwise, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1. Either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, and 'no' is printed**
