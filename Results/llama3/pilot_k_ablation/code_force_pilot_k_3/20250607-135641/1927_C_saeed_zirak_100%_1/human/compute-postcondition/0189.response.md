Postcondition: ***t is 3, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, newk is k divided by 2, i is leftOnes, leftOnes is greater than or equal to 0, aOnes is either the number of elements in a that are not in b plus leftOnes or the number of elements in a that are not in b plus leftOnes minus 1, bOnes is either the number of elements in b that are not in a plus leftOnes or the number of elements in b that are not in a plus leftOnes minus 1, and stdin is empty. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
