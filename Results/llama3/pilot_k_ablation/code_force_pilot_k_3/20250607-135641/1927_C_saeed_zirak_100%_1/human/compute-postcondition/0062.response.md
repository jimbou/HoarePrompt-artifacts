Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and not in `b` plus `leftOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and not in `a` plus `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
