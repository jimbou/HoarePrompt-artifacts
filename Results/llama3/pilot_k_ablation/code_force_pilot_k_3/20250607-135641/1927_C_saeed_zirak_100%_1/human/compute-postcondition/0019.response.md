Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is 0 or 1, `aOnes` is 1 or 2, `bOnes` is 0 or 1**

In this output state, the value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
