Postcondition: ***`t` is 3, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` is greater than 1, and `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b` plus 1, and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are not in `b`, and `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are not in `a` plus 1.***
