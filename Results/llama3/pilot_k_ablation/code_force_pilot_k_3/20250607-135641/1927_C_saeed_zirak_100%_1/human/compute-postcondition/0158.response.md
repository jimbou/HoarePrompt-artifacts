Postcondition: ***`t` is 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `i` is in `a`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `a` but in `b`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
