Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and the current value of `bOnes` is equal to `newk`. Additionally, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` if `leftOnes` is even. Otherwise, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1.**
