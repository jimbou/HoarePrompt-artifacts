The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and k.  If i is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3, k is greater than or equal to 3. k being greater than or equal to 3 does ensure that the loop will execute again, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, i being 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to i is less than or equal to k. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`**
