Postcondition: **`t` is 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `b`, then `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
