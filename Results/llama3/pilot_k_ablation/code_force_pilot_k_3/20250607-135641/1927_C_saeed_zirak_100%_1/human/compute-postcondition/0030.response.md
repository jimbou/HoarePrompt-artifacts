Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to k and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` retain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
