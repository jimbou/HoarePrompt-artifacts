Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively (1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    leftOnes = 0
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            leftOnes += 1
        elif i in a:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    i = 0
    while i < leftOnes:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and not in `b` plus `leftOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and not in `a` plus `leftOnes`. If `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` if `leftOnes` is even. Otherwise, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is 3, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, newk is k divided by 2, i is leftOnes, leftOnes is greater than or equal to 0, aOnes is either the number of elements in a that are not in b plus leftOnes or the number of elements in a that are not in b plus leftOnes minus 1, bOnes is either the number of elements in b that are not in a plus leftOnes or the number of elements in b that are not in a plus leftOnes minus 1, and stdin is empty. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
