Postcondition: **`t` is 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In either case, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `aOnes` is either 0 or 1.**
