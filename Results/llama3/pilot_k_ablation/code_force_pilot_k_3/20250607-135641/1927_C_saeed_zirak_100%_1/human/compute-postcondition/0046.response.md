Output State: **`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is greater than 1, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `bOnes`, which has been incremented by 1. The value of `bOnes` is now one more than its initial value, but its exact value is still unknown.
