Output State: **`t` is 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement.
