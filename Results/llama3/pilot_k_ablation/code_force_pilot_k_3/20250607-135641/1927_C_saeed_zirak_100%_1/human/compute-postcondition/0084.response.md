Output State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
