Postcondition: ***`t` is 3, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` is greater than 0, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are the number of elements in `a` and `b` that are not in each other, respectively, and `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is incremented by 1.***
