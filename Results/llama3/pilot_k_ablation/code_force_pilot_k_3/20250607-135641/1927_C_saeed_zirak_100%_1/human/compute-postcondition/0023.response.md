Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1 or 2. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1 or 2. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, then `aOnes` is 0 or 1, `bOnes` is 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
