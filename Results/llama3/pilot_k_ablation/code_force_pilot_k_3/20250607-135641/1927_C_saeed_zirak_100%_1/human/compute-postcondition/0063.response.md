The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and the input. If `t` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes**
