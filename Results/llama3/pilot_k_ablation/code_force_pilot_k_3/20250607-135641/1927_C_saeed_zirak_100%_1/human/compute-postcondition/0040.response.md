Postcondition: ***`t` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `k` and not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of elements in `b` that are less than or equal to `k` and not in `a`, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 0. `aOnes` is not less than `bOnes`***
