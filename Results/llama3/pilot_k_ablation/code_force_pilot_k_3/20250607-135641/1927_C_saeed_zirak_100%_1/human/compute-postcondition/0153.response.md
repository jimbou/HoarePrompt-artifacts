Output State: **`t` is 3, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `leftOnes` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `t` is still 3, `n` and `m` are still integers, `k` is still greater than or equal to 3, `newk` is still `k` divided by 2, and `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.
