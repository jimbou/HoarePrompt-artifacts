Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is `k` divided by 2, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` is greater than 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1, and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes` - 1.**
