#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively (1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6).
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
        
        leftOnes = 0
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                leftOnes += 1
            elif i in a:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < leftOnes:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, newk is k divided by 2, i is leftOnes, leftOnes is greater than or equal to 0, aOnes is either the number of elements in a that are not in b plus leftOnes or the number of elements in a that are not in b plus leftOnes minus 1, bOnes is either the number of elements in b that are not in a plus leftOnes or the number of elements in b that are not in a plus leftOnes minus 1, and stdin is empty. If aOnes is equal to newk and bOnes is equal to newk, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and determines whether it's possible to make two sets of numbers, a and b, have the same number of elements (newk) by adding elements from 1 to k. It prints 'yes' if possible and 'no' otherwise. The function iterates through each test case, analyzing the intersection and differences between sets a and b, and adjusts the counts of unique elements in each set. The final state of the program is that stdin is empty, and the function has printed 'yes' or 'no' for each test case.
