Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum of x and y followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the numbers and prints them accordingly. The program handles all possible cases, including when x is less than y, when x is equal to y, and when x is greater than y. The program also handles the case when both numbers are the same. 

The program does not have any logical errors and it works correctly for all the examples provided. The program also works correctly for all the edge cases, such as when x and y are both 0, or when x and y are both 9. 

Therefore, the program is correct and the answer is **True**.
