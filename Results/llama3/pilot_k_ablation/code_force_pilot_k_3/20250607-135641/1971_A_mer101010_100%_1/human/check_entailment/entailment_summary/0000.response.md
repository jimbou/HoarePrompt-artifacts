Reasoning:

The provided program is designed to solve the problem of taking two integers as input and outputting the minimum and maximum of the two integers. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the output.

Upon reviewing the program, it is clear that the logic is correct. The program correctly handles the cases where a < b, a == b, and a > b. In each case, the program prints the minimum value followed by the maximum value.

The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected. It reads the input pairs, reorders them if necessary, and prints the smaller integer first.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
