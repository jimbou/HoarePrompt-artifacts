Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y, and output them in that order.

2. The provided program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and reads input from the user.

3. The program first reads an integer `n` representing the number of test cases.

4. It then enters a loop that runs `n` times. In each iteration, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b`.

5. The program then uses an if-elif-else statement to compare `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints `a` followed by `b` (which is the same as printing `b` followed by `a` since they are equal). If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints `b` followed by `a`.

6. This logic correctly determines the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b` and prints them in the required order.

7. The program does not handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-integer inputs), but the problem statement assumes valid inputs.

8. The program does not explicitly return a value, but in Python, the lack of an explicit return statement implies a return value of `None`.

9. The program does not handle exceptions that may occur during input/output operations, but this is not a requirement of the problem.

10. Overall, the program correctly solves the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
