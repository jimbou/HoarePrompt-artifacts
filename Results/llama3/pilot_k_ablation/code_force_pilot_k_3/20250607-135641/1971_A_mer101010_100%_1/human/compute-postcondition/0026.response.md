Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `a` and `b` are printed, with `a` and `b` being integers between 0 and 9, and their order determined by whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`, stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two space-separated integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 9. The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with their order determined by their relative values. The stdin now contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9), since one line has been read and processed.
