Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first integer read. It then prints each pair, with the smaller integer first, to standard output. If the integers in a pair are equal, they are printed in the order they were read. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to reorder and print the input pairs.**
