Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is less than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is not less than `b`, the values of `b` and `a` are printed if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise the values of `a` and `b` are printed.***
