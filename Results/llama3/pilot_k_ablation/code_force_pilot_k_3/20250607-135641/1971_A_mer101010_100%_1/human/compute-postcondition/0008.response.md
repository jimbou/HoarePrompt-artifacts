The code prints the values of `a` and `b`. Based on the precondition, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `b` is also an integer between 0 and 9. Additionally, it is given that `a` is not less than `b`, and the current value of `a` is equal to `b`. This implies that `a` and `b` have the same value.

Output: **a (which is equal to b) (where a and b are integers between 0 and 9)**
