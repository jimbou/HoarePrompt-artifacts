Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). `a` is not less than `b`. The current value of `a` is equal to `b`, and the values of `a` and `b` which are equal are being printed**
