The code prints the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9. The order of `a` and `b` in the print statement is determined by their values, but in this case, `b` is printed first, followed by `a`. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute their exact numerical values. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `b` and `a` in the specified order.

Output: **[b] [a] (where b and a are integers between 0 and 9)**
