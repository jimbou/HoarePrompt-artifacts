The code prints the values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9. The order of `a` and `b` in the output is determined by their relative values: if `a` is less than `b`, `a` is printed first; if `a` is equal to `b`, their order is unchanged; and if `a` is greater than `b`, `b` is printed first.

Output: **a (an integer between 0 and 9) and b (an integer between 0 and 9), in the order determined by their relative values**
