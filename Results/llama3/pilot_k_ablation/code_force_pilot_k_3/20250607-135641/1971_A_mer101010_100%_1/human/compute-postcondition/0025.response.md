The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with `a` and `b` being integers between 0 and 9, and their order determined by whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`.**
