The code prints the values of variables `b` and `a`. 
`b` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9. 
Since `a` is not less than `b` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is greater than `b`.
Output: **b (where b is an integer between 0 and 9), a (where a is an integer between 0 and 9 and a > b)**
