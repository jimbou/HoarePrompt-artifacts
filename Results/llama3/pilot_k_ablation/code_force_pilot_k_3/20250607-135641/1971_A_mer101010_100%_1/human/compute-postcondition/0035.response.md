Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, and their order is determined by whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `b` and `a` are printed. stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished processing all the input lines from stdin, and the values of `a` and `b` are printed in the correct order based on their comparison. The loop counter `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`, and the input stream stdin is empty. The other variables `n` and `t` remain unchanged.
