Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 100, t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a < b:
        print(a, b)
    elif a == b:
        print(a, b)
    else:
        print(b, a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is less than `b`, the values of `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is not less than `b`, the values of `b` and `a` are printed if `a` is not equal to `b`, otherwise the values of `a` and `b` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). The values of `a` and `b` are printed, with `a` and `b` being integers between 0 and 9, and their order determined by whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, and their order is determined by whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `b` and `a` are printed. stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
