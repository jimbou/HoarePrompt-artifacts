Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `t` is 0, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, and their order is determined by whether `a` is less than, equal to, or greater than `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` and `b` are printed. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `b` and `a` are printed. stdin contains `n-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).***
