Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, t is 0, stdin contains n lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, which is assigned from the input. The value of `t` is 0, which is initialized in the code. Stdin contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are between 0 and 9 (inclusive).
