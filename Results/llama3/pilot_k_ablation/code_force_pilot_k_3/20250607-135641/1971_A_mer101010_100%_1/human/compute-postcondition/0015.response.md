The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**
