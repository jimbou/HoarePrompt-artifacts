According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, and `stdin` contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1 and `i` is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is 0, `stdin` contains `n` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9), `i` is 0**
