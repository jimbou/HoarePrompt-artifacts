Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `n-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the first two integers from the input, which are between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains `n-3` lines, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9), since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
