stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three inputs: first an integer, then two integers, and then a list of integers. The list of integers is followed by a number of queries, each query being two integers. The first integer of each query is less than or equal to the second integer. The sum of the lengths of the lists of integers over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of the number of queries over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5.
