Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program initializes two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the cumulative count of ones and the cumulative sum of the input array `nums`, respectively.
2.  It then processes each query by calculating the number of ones and the sum of the subarray specified by the query.
3.  The program checks if the subarray is good by verifying if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met. This condition ensures that the sum of the subarray is sufficient to distribute the elements such that each element is greater than 1 and not equal to the corresponding element in the original array.
4.  If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the conditions specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
