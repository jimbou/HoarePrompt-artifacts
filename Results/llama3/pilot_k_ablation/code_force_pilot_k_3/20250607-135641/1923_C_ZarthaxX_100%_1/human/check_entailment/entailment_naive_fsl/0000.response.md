Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether a subarray is good or not based on the given conditions. The program uses two arrays, `ones` and `sum`, to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray, respectively. 

The program then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones. This is because each element in the subarray must be greater than 0 and different from the corresponding element in the original array. 

If the sum of the subarray is sufficient to satisfy these conditions, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program handles the case where the subarray has only one element correctly by printing 'NO' immediately. 

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the conditions for a subarray to be good. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
