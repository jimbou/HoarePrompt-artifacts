Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from stdin and processes it according to the problem description.
2. It calculates the cumulative sum and count of ones in the list of integers, which is necessary to answer the queries.
3. For each query, it checks if the condition `2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange` is met. This condition is based on the problem description and is necessary to determine if the subarray is good.
4. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO', which is the correct output according to the problem description.

The program does not have any syntax errors, and the logic is correct. It correctly handles the edge case where `l == r` by printing 'NO' immediately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
