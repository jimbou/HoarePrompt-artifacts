Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-2 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise 0, ones[0] is 0, ones[2] is ones[1] plus 1 if nums[1] is 1, otherwise ones[2] is ones[1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0] and sum[0] is 0, sum[2] is sum[1] plus nums[1].**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `n` is still greater than 1. The stdin remains unchanged, containing t-2 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. The list `nums` remains unchanged, containing n integers. The list `ones` has been updated at index 2, where its value is now the sum of the value at index 1 and 1 if the value at index 1 in `nums` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as the value at index 1. The list `sum` has also been updated at index 2, where its value is now the sum of the value at index 1 and the value at index 1 in `nums`.
