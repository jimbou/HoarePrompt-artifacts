Output: **`i` is `n`, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input. The current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`, and 'NO' is being printed**
