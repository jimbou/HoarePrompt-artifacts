Output State: **`i` is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, l is an integer input from stdin, r is an integer input from stdin, onesInRange is ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus two inputs, and 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and 'NO' is still printed. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers minus two inputs.
