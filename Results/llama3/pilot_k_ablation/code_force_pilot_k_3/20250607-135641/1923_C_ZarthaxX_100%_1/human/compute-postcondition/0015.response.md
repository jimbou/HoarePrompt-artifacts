Output State: **i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q must be greater than 0, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `ones`, `sum`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces two new variables: `onesInRange` and `sumInRange`. `onesInRange` is calculated as the difference between `ones[r]` and `ones[l - 1]`, which represents the number of ones in the range from index `l - 1` to `r` in the `nums` list. Similarly, `sumInRange` is calculated as the difference between `sum[r]` and `sum[l - 1]`, which represents the sum of the numbers in the range from index `l - 1` to `r` in the `nums` list. The stdin remains unchanged, containing a space-separated list of integers minus one input.
