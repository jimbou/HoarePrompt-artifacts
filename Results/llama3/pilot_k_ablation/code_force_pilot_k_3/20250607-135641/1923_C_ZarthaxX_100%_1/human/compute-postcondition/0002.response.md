Output State: **n is greater than 0, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise 0, and ones[0] is 0, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0] and sum[0] is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is still 1. The stdin remains unchanged, containing t-1 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. The list `nums` also remains unchanged, containing a list of n integers. 

The list `ones` is modified, where `ones[1]` is now 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise it is 0. The value of `ones[0]` remains 0. 

The list `sum` is also modified, where `sum[1]` is now equal to `nums[0]`, and `sum[0]` remains 0.
