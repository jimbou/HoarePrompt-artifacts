The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, q must be decreased by 1.
State: **i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input. If 2 times onesInRange plus r minus l plus 1 minus onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
