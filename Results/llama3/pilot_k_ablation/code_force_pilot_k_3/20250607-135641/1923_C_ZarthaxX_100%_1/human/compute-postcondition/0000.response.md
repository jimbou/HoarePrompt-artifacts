Output State: **stdin contains t-1 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros.**

The code reads the first set of inputs from stdin, which contains an integer t, followed by t sets of inputs. The first line reads the first set of inputs, which consists of two integers n and q, and assigns them to the variables n and q, respectively. The second line reads a list of n integers from stdin and assigns it to the variable nums. The third and fourth lines initialize two lists, ones and sum, with n+1 zeros.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows: n and q are integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, and sum is a list of n+1 zeros. The stdin still contains t-1 sets of inputs, each consisting of two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers.
