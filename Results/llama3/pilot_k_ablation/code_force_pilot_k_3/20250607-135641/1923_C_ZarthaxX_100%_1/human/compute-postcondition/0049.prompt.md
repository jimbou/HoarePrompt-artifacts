Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1].
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q must be greater than 0, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input. If 2 times onesInRange plus r minus l plus 1 minus onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, l is an integer input from stdin, r is an integer input from stdin, onesInRange is ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus two inputs. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, l is an integer input from stdin, r is an integer input from stdin, onesInRange is ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus two inputs. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
