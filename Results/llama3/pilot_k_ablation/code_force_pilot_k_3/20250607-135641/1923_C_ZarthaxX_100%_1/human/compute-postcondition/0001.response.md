According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros**
