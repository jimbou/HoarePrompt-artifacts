Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input. The current value of `l` is equal to the current value of `r`, and 'NO' is being printed, and we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables `i`, `ones`, `sum`, `q`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged, and 'NO' is still being printed. The only change is that we move on to the next iteration of the loop.
