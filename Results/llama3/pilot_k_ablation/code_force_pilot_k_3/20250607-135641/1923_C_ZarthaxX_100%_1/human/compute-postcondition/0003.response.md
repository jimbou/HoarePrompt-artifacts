The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-2 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise 0, and ones[0] is 0, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0] and sum[0] is 0**
