Output State: **i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1].**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the lists `ones` and `sum` will be updated accordingly. The `ones` list will keep track of the cumulative count of ones in the `nums` list, and the `sum` list will keep track of the cumulative sum of the `nums` list.
