Postcondition: ***i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q must be greater than 0, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is ones[r] - ones[l - 1], sumInRange is sum[r] - sum[l - 1], stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input. The current value of onesInRange and sumInRange is such that 2 times onesInRange plus r minus l plus 1 minus onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange.***
