Output State: **i is n, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is ones[i - 1] plus 1 if nums[i - 1] is 1, otherwise ones[i] is ones[i - 1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is sum[i - 1] plus nums[i - 1], q is 0, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus q inputs.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` remains unchanged as `n`, the `ones` and `sum` lists remain unchanged as well, the value of `q` becomes 0 since the loop has executed all its iterations, and the standard input `stdin` contains a space-separated list of integers minus `q` inputs, where `q` is the number of iterations the loop executed.
