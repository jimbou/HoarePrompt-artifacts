Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]`, `q` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `l` is an integer input from stdin, `r` is an integer input from stdin, `onesInRange` is `ones[r] - ones[l - 1]`, `sumInRange` is `sum[r] - sum[l - 1]`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus two inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `ones`, `sum`, and `q` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to the two integers input from stdin. The values of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are calculated based on the updated values of `l` and `r`. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers minus two inputs.
