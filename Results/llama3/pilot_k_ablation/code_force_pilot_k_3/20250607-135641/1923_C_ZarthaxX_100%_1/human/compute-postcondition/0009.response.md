Output State: **`i` is `n`, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]` plus 1 if `nums[i - 1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[i]` is `ones[i - 1]`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is `sum[i - 1]` plus `nums[i - 1]`, `q` must be greater than 0, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input**.

In this output state, the values of `i`, `ones`, `sum`, and `q` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced two new variables `l` and `r`, which are assigned the values of the two integers from the input. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers minus one input, as one input has been consumed by the `input().split(' ')` function.
