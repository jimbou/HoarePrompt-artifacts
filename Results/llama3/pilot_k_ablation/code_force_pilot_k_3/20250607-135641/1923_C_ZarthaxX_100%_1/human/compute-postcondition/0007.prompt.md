Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers. n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    ones[i] = ones[i - 1] + (1 if nums[i - 1] == 1 else 0)
    sum[i] = sum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is greater than 0, i is 1, stdin contains t-1 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise 0, and ones[0] is 0, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0] and sum[0] is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is greater than 1, i is 2, stdin contains t-2 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise 0, ones[0] is 0, ones[2] is ones[1] plus 1 if nums[1] is 1, otherwise ones[2] is ones[1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0] and sum[0] is 0, sum[2] is sum[1] plus nums[1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than 2, i is 3, stdin contains t-2 times: two integers n and q, a list of n integers, and q pairs of integers, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise 0, ones[0] is 0, ones[2] is ones[1] plus 1 if nums[1] is 1, otherwise ones[2] is ones[1], ones[3] is ones[2] plus 1 if nums[2] is 1, otherwise ones[3] is ones[2], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0] and sum[0] is 0, sum[2] is sum[1] plus nums[1], sum[3] is sum[2] plus nums[2]




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
