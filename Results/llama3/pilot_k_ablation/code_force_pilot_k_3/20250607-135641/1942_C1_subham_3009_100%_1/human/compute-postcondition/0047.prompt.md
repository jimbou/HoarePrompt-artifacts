Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    arr.sort()
    arr.append(n + arr[0])
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2, i is x, and the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2 is printed, ans (where ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers with a difference of 2 in the sorted list arr)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is `x` if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 2 for all `i` from 1 to `x`, otherwise `ans` is less than `x`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= `n` <= 10^9, 2 <= `x` <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and ans is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 0, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is either x - 2 or x - 1 or x, i is x, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and ans is printed which is either x - 2 or x - 1 or x


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
