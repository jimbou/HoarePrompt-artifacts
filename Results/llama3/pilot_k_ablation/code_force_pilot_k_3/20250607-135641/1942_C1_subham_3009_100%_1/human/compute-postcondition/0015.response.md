The code prints the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the sorted list `arr` that have a difference of 2.
Since `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `x` is between 2 and `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, the list `arr` contains a subset of integers from 1 to `n`.
The variable `ans` is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `arr` that have a difference of 2. This means that for each pair of consecutive integers in `arr`, if the difference between them is 2, it is counted towards `ans`.
Since `i` is equal to `x`, which is the number of elements in `arr`, the loop iterates over all pairs of consecutive integers in `arr`.
Therefore, the print statement will output the total number of pairs of consecutive integers in `arr` that have a difference of 2.
Output: **the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2**
