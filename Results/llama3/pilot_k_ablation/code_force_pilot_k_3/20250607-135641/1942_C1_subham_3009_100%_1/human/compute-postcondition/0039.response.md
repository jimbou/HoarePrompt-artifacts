Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 1, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, `ans` is either `x` or `x - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1. Initially, `ans` is either `x - 1` or `x - 2`. After the increment, `ans` becomes either `x` or `x - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
