The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which already ensures that t is greater than 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
