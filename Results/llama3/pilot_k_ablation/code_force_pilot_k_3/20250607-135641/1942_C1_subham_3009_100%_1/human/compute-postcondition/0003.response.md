Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is x - 2.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1. The stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The values of n, x, and y have been assigned from the input. The list arr has been created from the input, sorted in ascending order, and an additional element n + arr[0] has been appended to it. The variable ans has been assigned the value x - 2.
