The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
