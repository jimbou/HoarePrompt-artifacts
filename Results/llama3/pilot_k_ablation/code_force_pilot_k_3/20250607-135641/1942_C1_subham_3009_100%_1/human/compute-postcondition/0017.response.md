To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `t` since it's the only variable in the loop head. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, but this does not guarantee that the loop will execute again. Therefore, `t` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2, i is x, and the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2 is printed, ans (where ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers with a difference of 2 in the sorted list arr)**
