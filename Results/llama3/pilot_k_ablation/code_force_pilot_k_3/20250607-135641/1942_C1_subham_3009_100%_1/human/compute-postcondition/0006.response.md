Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is x - 1, i is 1, x is at least 1. The current value of i is 1, and the difference between the current element and the previous element in arr is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `x - 1`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
