The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 2, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is 3, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in the array is 2, then ans is x - 1, otherwise ans is x - 2.**
