Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 0, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is x - 2, i is x, stdin contains t test cases.**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `t` has decreased by 1. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` have been updated based on the input from stdin. The list `arr` now contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, sorted in ascending order, and an additional element `n + arr[0]` has been appended to the end. The variable `ans` has been initialized to `x - 2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at `x`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
