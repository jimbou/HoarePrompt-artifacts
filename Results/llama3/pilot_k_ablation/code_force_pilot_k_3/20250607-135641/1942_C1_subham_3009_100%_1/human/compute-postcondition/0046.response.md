The code prints the value of `ans` which is either `x - 2` or `x - 1` or `x`. Where `x` is an integer between 2 and `min(n, 2 * 10^5)` and is greater than 0.
Output: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 0, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is either x - 2 or x - 1 or x, i is x, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and ans is printed which is either x - 2 or x - 1 or x**
