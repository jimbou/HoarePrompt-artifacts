Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2, i is x.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `ans` will hold the count of pairs of consecutive integers in the array `arr` that have a difference of 2. The loop iterates over the array, checking each pair of adjacent elements and incrementing `ans` whenever it finds a pair with a difference of 2. After the loop finishes, `i` will be equal to `x`, indicating that the loop has processed all elements in the array.
