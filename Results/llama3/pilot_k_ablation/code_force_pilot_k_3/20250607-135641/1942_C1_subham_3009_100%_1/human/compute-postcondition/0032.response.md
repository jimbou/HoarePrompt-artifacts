The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is `x` if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 2 for all `i` from 1 to `x`, otherwise `ans` is less than `x`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= `n` <= 10^9, 2 <= `x` <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and ans is printed**
