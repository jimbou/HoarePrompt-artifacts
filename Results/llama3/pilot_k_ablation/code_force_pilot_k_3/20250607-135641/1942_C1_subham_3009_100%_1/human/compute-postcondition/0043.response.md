Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 2, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3, `ans` is either `x - 1` if the difference between the current element and the previous element in the array is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x - 2`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.***
