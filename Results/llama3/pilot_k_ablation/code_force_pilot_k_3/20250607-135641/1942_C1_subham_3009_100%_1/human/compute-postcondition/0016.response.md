The code prints the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the sorted list `arr` that have a difference of 2.
Since the exact `arr` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated number of pairs of consecutive integers with a difference of 2.
Output: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2, i is x, and the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr that have a difference of 2 is printed, ans (where ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers with a difference of 2 in the sorted list arr)**
