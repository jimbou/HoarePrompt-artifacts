The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and x. If i is less than x + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 1, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time i is increased by 1 so i is 2 and for the loop to execute again x must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 1, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, if the difference between the current element and the previous element in the array is 2, then ans is x - 1, otherwise ans is x - 2, i is 2, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**
