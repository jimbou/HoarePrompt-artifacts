Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 0, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is either x - 2 or x - 1 or x, i is x, and ans is printed which is either x - 2 or x - 1 or x.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the number of test cases `t` is 0, the standard input `stdin` is empty, the variables `n`, `x`, and `y` retain their values from the last test case, the list `arr` is sorted and contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the variable `ans` holds the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `arr` that have a difference of 2, and the loop counter `i` is equal to `x`. The value of `ans` is printed, which can be either `x - 2`, `x - 1`, or `x`.
