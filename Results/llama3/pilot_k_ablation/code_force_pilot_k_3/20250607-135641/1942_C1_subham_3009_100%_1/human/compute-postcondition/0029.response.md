Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is `x` if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 2 for all `i` from 1 to `x`, otherwise `ans` is less than `x`, `i` is `x`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= `n` <= 10^9, 2 <= `x` <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `ans` will be equal to `x` if the difference between every pair of consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` is 2, otherwise `ans` will be less than `x`. The loop has iterated over all elements in `arr`, and the value of `i` is now equal to `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
