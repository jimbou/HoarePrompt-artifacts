Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is `x` - 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y` (4 <= `n` <= 10^9, 2 <= `x` <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` = 0). The second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The current value of `i` is 1 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `x - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged. The input stream still contains `t-1` test cases, each consisting of two lines. The first line contains three integers `n`, `x`, and `y`, and the second line contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The list `arr` is still sorted and contains `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The current index `i` is still 1, and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `arr` is still 2.
