The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.

If the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` is 2, then `ans` is equal to `x`, which is the number of elements in `arr`. This means that all elements in `arr` are consecutive integers with a difference of 2.

If the difference between any pair of consecutive elements in `arr` is not 2, then `ans` is less than `x`. This means that there is at least one pair of consecutive elements in `arr` that does not have a difference of 2.

Since the exact values of `arr` and `x` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `x` or a value less than `x`.

Output: **x (if all elements in arr have a difference of 2) or a value less than x (if any pair of consecutive elements in arr does not have a difference of 2)**
