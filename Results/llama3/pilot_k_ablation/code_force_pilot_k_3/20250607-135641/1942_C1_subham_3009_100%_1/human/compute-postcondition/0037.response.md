Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 0, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, if the difference between the current element and the previous element in the array is 2, then ans is x - 1, otherwise ans is x - 2, i is 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases***
