Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and x is greater than 0, y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is either x - 2 or x - 1 or x, i is x, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` has reached `x`, and the value of `ans` has been updated based on the differences between consecutive elements in the array `arr`. The value of `ans` can be either `x - 2`, `x - 1`, or `x`, depending on the number of times the difference between consecutive elements is 2. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `y`, and `arr`, remain unchanged.
