Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, if the difference between the first two elements in arr is 2, then ans is x, otherwise ans is x - 1, i is 2, x is at least 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now either `x` or `x - 1`, depending on the difference between the first two elements in `arr`. The rest of the state remains the same, with `t` still being an integer between 0 and 10^4, and the stdin containing `t-1` test cases, each with two lines of input.
