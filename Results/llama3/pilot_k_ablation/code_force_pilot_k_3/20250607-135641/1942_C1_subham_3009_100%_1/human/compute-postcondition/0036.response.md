Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^9, `x` is an integer between 2 and min(n, 2 * 10^5) and `x` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `ans` is `x - 1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and the difference between the current element and the previous element in the array is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `x - 1`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases, as the current test case has not been processed yet. The array `arr` still has the same properties, with the difference between consecutive elements being 2.
