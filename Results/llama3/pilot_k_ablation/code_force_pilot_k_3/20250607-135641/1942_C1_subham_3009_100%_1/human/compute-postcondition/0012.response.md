Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n, n is an integer between 4 and 10^9, x is an integer between 3 and min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, if the difference between the first two elements in arr is 2, then ans is x + 1, otherwise ans is x, i is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` now depends on whether the difference between the first two elements in `arr` is 2. If it is, `ans` is `x + 1`, otherwise, `ans` is `x`. The rest of the variables and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
