The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) followed by x distinct integers. It then sorts the integers and checks for pairs of consecutive integers with a difference of 2. The function prints the count of such pairs plus x-2 for each test case. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
