This function determines whether it is possible to distribute a certain amount of water into n containers, where the total amount of water is divisible by n. It takes two inputs: a positive integer n and a list of non-negative integers a representing the amount of water in each container. The function returns 'YES' if the water can be distributed evenly among the containers and 'NO' otherwise. If the total amount of water is not divisible by n, the function immediately returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it iterates through the list of water amounts, calculating the target amount for each container and checking if the current container can hold the target amount. If at any point a container cannot hold the target amount, the function returns 'NO'. If the function completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES', indicating that the water can be distributed evenly among the containers.
