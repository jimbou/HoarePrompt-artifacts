Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water in each container. If the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, it immediately returns 'NO'.

Then, it iterates over the containers and calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. If at any point the cumulative difference is negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so it returns 'NO'.

If it finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
