Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have. It checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, and if not, it immediately returns 'NO'.

2. The program then iterates through the amounts of water in each container, keeping track of the cumulative difference between the current container's water and the target amount. If at any point this cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to pour into the current container to make it equal to the target amount, so the program returns 'NO'.

3. If the program iterates through all the containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, so it returns 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1, or where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers. It also correctly handles the case where the amounts of water in the containers are not all equal, but can be made equal by pouring water from one container to another.

Therefore, the program is correct and should return the expected output for all possible inputs.
