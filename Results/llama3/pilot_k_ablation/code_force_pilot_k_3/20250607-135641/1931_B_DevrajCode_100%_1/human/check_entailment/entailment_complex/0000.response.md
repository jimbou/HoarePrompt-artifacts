Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the program immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem states that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
2.  The program then calculates the target amount of water for each container by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers.
3.  The program iterates through the list of water amounts, calculating the difference between the current amount and the target amount. If the difference is negative, it means that the current container cannot hold the target amount, so the program returns 'NO'.
4.  If the program completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it means that all containers can hold the target amount, so the program returns 'YES'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
