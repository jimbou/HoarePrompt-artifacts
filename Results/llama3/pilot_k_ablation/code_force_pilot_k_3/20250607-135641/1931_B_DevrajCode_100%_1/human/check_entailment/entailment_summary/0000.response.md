Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The program first checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because the problem statement guarantees that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

Then, it iterates through the list of water amounts, calculating the target amount for each container and checking if the current container can hold the target amount. If at any point a container cannot hold the target amount, the function returns 'NO', which is correct because it means that the water cannot be distributed evenly among the containers.

If the function completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it returns 'YES', indicating that the water can be distributed evenly among the containers. This is also correct because the program has checked all containers and found that they can all hold the target amount.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and its output matches the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
