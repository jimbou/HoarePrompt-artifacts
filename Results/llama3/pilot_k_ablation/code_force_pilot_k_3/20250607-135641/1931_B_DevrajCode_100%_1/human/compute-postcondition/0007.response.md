Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, the current value of `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` and is less than 0, and the current value of `water` is the first element in `a`.**
