Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the second element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the third element in `a` minus the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, and `water` is the third element in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `container` has been updated by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to its previous value. The values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain unchanged. The value of `water` is still the third element in `a`.
