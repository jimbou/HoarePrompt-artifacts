Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers, total_water is the sum of a, and target is the integer division of total_water by n.**

The code calculates the total sum of the list `a` and assigns it to `total_water`. Since the sum of `a` is divisible by `n`, `total_water` is also divisible by `n`. The second line calculates the integer division of `total_water` by `n` and assigns it to `target`. This means that `target` is the largest integer less than or equal to the result of the division. The values of `n` and `a` remain unchanged.
