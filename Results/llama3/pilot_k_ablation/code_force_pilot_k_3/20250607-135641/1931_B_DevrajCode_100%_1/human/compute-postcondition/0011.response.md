Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the second element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the second element in `a`. The value of `container` is more than or equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been updated to include the difference between `water` and `target`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `container` is still non-negative, as it was before the update.
