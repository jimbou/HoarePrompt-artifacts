To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for water in a:`. This means we can only adjust the states of `water` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `water` is the first element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `water` needs to be the next element in `a`. Since `a` has at least `n` elements, and `n` is a positive integer, we can assume that `a` has at least 2 elements.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `water` should be the second element in `a`.

The state of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables `n`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Here is the updated state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the second element in `a`. The value of `container` is more than or equal to 0**
