The code `container += water - target` adds the difference between `water` and `target` to `container`. The value of `water` is the first element in `a`, and the value of `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. Since `total_water` is the sum of `a` and is divisible by `n`, the value of `target` is an integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the first element in `a`.**
