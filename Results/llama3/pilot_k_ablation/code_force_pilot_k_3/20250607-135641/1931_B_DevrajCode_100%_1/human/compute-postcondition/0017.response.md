Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the second element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the third element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the third element in `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.***
