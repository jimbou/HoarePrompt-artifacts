Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, and `container` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for water in a:
    container += water - target
    if container < 0:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the first element in `a`. The value of `container` is more than or equal to 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the second element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the second element in `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the second element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the third element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the third element in `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
