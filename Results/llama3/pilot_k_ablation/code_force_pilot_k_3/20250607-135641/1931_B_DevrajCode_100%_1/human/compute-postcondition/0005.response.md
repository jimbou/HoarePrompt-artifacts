To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `water` and the list `a`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop will execute if the list `a` has at least one element.
2. Since `total_water` is the sum of `a` and is divisible by `n`, we know that `a` must have at least `n` elements.
3. The variable `water` will take on the value of the first element in `a` during the first iteration.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:


State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, `container` is 0, and `water` is the first element in `a`**
