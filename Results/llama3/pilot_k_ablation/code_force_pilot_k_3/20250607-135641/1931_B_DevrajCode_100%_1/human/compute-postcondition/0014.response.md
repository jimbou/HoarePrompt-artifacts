To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `water` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `water` is the second element in `a`. For the loop to execute again, `water` should be the next element in `a`. Since `a` has at least `n` elements and `n` is a positive integer, we can assume that `a` has at least 3 elements.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `water` should be the third element in `a`.

The state of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `n`, `total_water`, `target`, and `container`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the first element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n` plus the second element in `a` minus the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the third element in `a`.**
