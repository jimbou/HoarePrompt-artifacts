Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers with at least `n` elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `container` is the sum of the elements in `a` minus `n` times the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and `water` is the last element in `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same properties as the initial state, except for the values of `container` and `water`. The value of `container` will be the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times the integer division of the sum of `a` by `n`, and the value of `water` will be the last element in `a`. If at any point during the loop's execution `container` becomes less than 0, the program will return the string 'NO'. Otherwise, the loop will complete all its iterations without taking any specific action.
