The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `operations` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0**
