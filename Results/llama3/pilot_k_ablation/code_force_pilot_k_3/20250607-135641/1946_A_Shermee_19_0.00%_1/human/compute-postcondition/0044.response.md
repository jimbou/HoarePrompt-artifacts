The code prints the value of `operations`, which is the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median.

Since `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `median_index` is an integer, the `median` is the middle value of the list `a`. The value of `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median.

Output: **the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median (where median is the middle value of the sorted list a)**
