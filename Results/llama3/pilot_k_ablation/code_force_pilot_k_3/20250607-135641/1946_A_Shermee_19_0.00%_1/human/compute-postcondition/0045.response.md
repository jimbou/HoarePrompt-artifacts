Output: ** `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median, and the value of operations which is the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median is being printed**
