Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `operations` is increased by `median - a[1]`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the current `median` and the second element of the sorted list `a` (since `i` is 1). All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being a positive integer greater than 0, `_` being 0, `n` being greater than 0, `a` being a sorted list of integers, `median_index` being an integer, `median` being an integer, and `stdin` containing no input.
