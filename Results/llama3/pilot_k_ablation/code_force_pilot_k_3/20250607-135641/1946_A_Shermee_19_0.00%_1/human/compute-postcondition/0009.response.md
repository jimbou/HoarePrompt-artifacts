Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1. If `a[1]` is less than `median`, then `operations` is increased by `median - a[1]`.***
