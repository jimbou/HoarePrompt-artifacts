Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 1, `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median plus (median - a[i]) and the value of operations is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `operations` is increased by the difference between the median and the current element `a[i]`, and this new value of `operations` is printed. The other variables remain unchanged.
