The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, median_index is an integer, median is an integer, stdin contains no input, i is n-1, operations is increased by median - a[i] does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `operations` is increased by median - a[i]**
