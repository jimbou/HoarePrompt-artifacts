To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which already ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, we can further specify the state of `_` and `t` for the first iteration.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0**
