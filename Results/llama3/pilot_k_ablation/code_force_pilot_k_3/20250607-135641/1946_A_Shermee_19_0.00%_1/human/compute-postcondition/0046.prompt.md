Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    median_index = n // 2
    median = a[median_index]
    operations = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if a[i] < median:
            operations += median - a[i]
    print(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[i]` is less than `median`, then `operations` is increased by `median - a[i]`, and the value of operations is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, median_index is an integer, median is an integer, stdin contains no input, i is n, operations is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median, and the value of operations is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median, and the value of operations which is the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
