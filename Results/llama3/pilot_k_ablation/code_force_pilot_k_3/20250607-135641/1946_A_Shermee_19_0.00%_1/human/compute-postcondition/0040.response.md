State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 2, if `a[i]` is less than `median`, `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median plus (median - a[i]) and the value of operations is printed. If `a[i]` is not less than `median`, the value of operations remains unchanged and the value of operations is printed.**
