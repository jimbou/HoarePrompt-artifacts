Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 0, `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median plus (median - a[i]), and the value of operations is printed, `a[i]` is less than `median`**.

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between the current `median` and the value of `a` at index `i`, which is less than the `median`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
