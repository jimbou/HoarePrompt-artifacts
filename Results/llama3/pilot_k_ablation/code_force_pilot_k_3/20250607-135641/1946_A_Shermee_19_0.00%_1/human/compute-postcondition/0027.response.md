Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 2, `operations` is increased by a positive integer (median - a[2]) if `a[2]` is less than `median`, otherwise no change is made to `operations`, stdin contains no input.***
