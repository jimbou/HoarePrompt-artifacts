Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains no input. If `a[1]` is less than `median`, `operations` is increased by a positive integer (median - a[1]). Otherwise, no change is made to `operations`.***
