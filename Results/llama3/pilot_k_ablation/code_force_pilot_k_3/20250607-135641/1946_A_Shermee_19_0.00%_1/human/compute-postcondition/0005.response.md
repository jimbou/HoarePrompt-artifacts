Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `operations` is `median - a[i]`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `median`.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated to be the difference between the current value of `median` and the current value of `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
