To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which means the loop will not execute if `n` is 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range).

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median, and the value of operations is printed**
