The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains no input. If `a[1]` is less than `median`, `operations` is increased by a positive integer (median - a[1]). Otherwise, no change is made to `operations`.**
