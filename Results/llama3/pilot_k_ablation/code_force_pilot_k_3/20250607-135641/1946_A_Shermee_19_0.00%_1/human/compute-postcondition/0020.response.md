The value of `operations` is increased by `median - a[i]`. The current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `median`, so `median - a[i]` is positive. Therefore, the value of `operations` is increased by a positive integer.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0, `operations` is increased by a positive integer (median - a[i])**
