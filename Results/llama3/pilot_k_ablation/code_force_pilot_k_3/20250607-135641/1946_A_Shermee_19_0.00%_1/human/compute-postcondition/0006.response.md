Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is less than the current value of `median`, `operations` is `median - a[i]`.***
