Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 2, `operations` is increased by `median - a[2]`.**

In this output state, the value of `operations` has been updated by adding the difference between `median` and the third element of the sorted list `a` (since `i` is 2). The other variables remain unchanged.
