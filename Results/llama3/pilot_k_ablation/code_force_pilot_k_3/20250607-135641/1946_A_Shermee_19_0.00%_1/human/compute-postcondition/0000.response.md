Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1 test case. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and then a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the input operation, so the number of test cases remaining is one less than the original number. The remaining test cases still contain two inputs each: an integer n and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n.
