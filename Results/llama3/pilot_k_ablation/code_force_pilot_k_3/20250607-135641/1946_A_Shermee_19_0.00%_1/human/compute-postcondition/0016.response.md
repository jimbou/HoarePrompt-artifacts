To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration counter, and `t`, which is the number of iterations.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n-1`, `operations` is increased by `median - a[i]`**
