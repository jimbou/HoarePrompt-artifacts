The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `median_index` is an integer, `median` is an integer, `i` is 1, `operations` is increased by the sum of positive integers (median - a[j]) for all j where a[j] is less than median, and the value of operations is printed. If `a[i]` is less than `median`, `operations` is increased by (median - a[i]) and the value of operations is printed.**
