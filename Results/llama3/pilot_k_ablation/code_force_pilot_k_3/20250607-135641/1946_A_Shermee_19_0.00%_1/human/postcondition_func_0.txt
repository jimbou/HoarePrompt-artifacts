This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and a list of n integers. It calculates the median of the list, then computes the sum of the differences between the median and all numbers less than the median. The function prints this sum for each test case, effectively calculating the minimum number of operations required to make all numbers in the list greater than or equal to the median.
