Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding the minimum number of operations to increase the median of the array. However, the program calculates the total number of operations required to make all elements less than the median equal to the median, which is not the minimum number of operations required.

The correct approach would be to find the number of elements that need to be increased to make the median greater than its current value. This can be done by counting the number of elements that are equal to the median and adding 1 to it.

Here's the correct code:

```python
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    median_index = (n - 1) // 2  # corrected index calculation
    median = a[median_index]
    operations = 0
    for i in range(median_index, n):
        if a[i] == median:
            operations += 1
    print(operations)
```

Correctness: **False**
