Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of operations. The program currently calculates the total difference between the median and all numbers less than the median, which is not the correct approach.

A correct approach would be to find the number of elements that need to be increased to be greater than the current median. This can be done by counting the number of elements that are less than or equal to the median and then subtracting the index of the median (since the median is included in this count).

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        median = a[median_index]
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if a[i] == median:
                operations += 1
        print(operations)
```

This corrected program works by counting the number of elements that are equal to the median and need to be increased to be greater than the median. This is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
