Correctness: **False** 

The given program is incorrect. The task is to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. However, the program calculates the total number of operations required to make all elements in the array greater than or equal to the median, which is not the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

To increase the median, we only need to increase the elements that are less than the median and are at or to the right of the median index. The program should only consider these elements and calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase them to be greater than the median.

Here is the correct code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        a.sort()
        median_index = n // 2
        median = a[median_index]
        operations = 0
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if a[i] == median:
                operations += 1
                break
        print(operations)
```

This code correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.
