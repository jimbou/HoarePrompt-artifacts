Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 1 except for a[i] which is mapped to 0, res is a string of length 1 containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 in sam, i is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The string `sam` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The dictionary `a_map` is updated such that the value of the key `a[i]` is incremented by 1, and all other keys remain unchanged. The string `res` is updated to contain the character at index `a_map[a[i]] % 27` in `sam`. The variable `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
