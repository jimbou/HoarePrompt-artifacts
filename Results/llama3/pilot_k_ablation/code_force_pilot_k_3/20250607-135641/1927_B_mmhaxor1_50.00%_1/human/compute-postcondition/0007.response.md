Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to the number of times each key appears in a, res is a string of length n containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 in sam for each i, i is n-1**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 'n' remains unchanged, the list 'a' remains unchanged, the string 'sam' remains unchanged, the dictionary 'a_map' has been updated to map each key to the number of times it appears in the list 'a', the string 'res' has been updated to contain the characters at the indices specified by the values in 'a_map' modulo 27 in the string 'sam', and the variable 'i' has been updated to be one less than 'n'.
