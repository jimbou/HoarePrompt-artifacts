Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 0, res is an empty string**

The code initializes a string `sam` with the alphabet, creates a dictionary `a_map` with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 0, and sets `res` to an empty string. The initial state of `n` and `a` remains unchanged as the code does not modify them.
