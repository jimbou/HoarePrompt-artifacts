To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, it remains the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers such that for each `i`, 0 <= `a[i]` < `n`, `sam` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', `a_map` is a dictionary with keys from 0 to `n-1` all mapped to 1 except for `a[i]` which is mapped to 0, `res` is a string of length 1 containing the character at index `a_map[a[i]]` % 27 in `sam`, `i` is 1**
