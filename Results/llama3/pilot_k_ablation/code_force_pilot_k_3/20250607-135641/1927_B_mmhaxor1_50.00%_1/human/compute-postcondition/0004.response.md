Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to 1 except for a[i] which is mapped to 1, res is a string of length 2 containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 in sam and the character at index 1 % 27 in sam, i is 1**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code executes three lines, modifying the values of `beg`, `res`, and `a_map[a[i]]`. 

Initially, `a_map[a[i]]` is 0, so `beg` becomes 0. The second line appends the character at index `a_map[a[i]]` % 27 in `sam` to `res`. Since `a_map[a[i]]` is 0, `res` now contains the character at index 0 % 27 in `sam`, which is 'a', and the character at index 1 % 27 in `sam`, which is 'b'. 

The third line increments `a_map[a[i]]` by 1, making it 1. 

No other variables are affected by the code. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, `a` remains a list of `n` non-negative integers, `sam` remains the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', and `i` remains 1.
