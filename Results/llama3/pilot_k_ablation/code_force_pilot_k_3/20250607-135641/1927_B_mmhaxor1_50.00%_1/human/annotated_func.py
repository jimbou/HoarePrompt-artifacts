#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < n.

    #State: n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < n, sam is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz', a_map is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to the number of times each key appears in a, res is a string of length n containing the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 in sam for each i, i is n-1
    return res
    #The program returns a string 'res' of length n, where each character in 'res' is the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 in the string 'sam' for each i, and 'a_map' is a dictionary with keys from 0 to n-1 all mapped to the number of times each key appears in list 'a', and 'a' is a list of n non-negative integers such that for each i, 0 <= a[i] < n, and 'sam' is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvqwxyz'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a string of length n, where each character is determined by the frequency of its corresponding index in the input list 'a'. The function takes a list 'a' of n non-negative integers as input, where each integer is less than n. It returns a string 'res' where each character is the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 in the string 'sam' (a string of lowercase English letters), and a_map is a dictionary that maps each integer in 'a' to its frequency. The function does not modify the input list 'a'.
