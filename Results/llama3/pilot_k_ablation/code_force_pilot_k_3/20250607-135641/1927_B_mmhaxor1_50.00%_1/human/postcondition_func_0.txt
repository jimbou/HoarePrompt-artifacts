This function generates a string of length n, where each character is determined by the frequency of its corresponding index in the input list 'a'. The function takes a list 'a' of n non-negative integers as input, where each integer is less than n. It returns a string 'res' where each character is the character at index a_map[a[i]] % 27 in the string 'sam' (a string of lowercase English letters), and a_map is a dictionary that maps each integer in 'a' to its frequency. The function does not modify the input list 'a'.
