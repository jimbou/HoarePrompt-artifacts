The code prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `k` is 1.
Output: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and then t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), input() is greater than 0, _ is 0, and `n` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `k` is 1, and this is printed: "1 2 3 ... n"**
