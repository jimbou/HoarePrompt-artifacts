The code prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times, excluding the last character (which is a space) due to the `[:-1]` slice.

Since `n` is equal to `k` and `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), the value of `n` is also an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), excluding the last space.

Output: **'1 ' repeated n times, where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), excluding the last space**
