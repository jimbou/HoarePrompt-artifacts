Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and then t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), input() is greater than 0, _ is 0. If `n` is equal to `k`, a string of n-1 '1 's is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, "1 2 3 ... n" is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
