Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k. If `n` equals `k`, a string of n-1 '1's separated by spaces is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of space-separated integers from 1 to `n` is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
