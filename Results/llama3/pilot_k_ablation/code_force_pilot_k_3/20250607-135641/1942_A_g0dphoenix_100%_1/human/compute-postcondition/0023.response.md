Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is printed. Otherwise, if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.**
