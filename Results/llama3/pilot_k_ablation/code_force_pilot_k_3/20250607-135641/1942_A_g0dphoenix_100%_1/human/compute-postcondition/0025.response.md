Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the new values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 10^3 and between 1 and `n`, respectively. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains t-3 pairs of integers n and k, as one pair has been read and processed.
