The code prints a string containing a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3. The sequence is generated using a list comprehension that iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1`, adds 1 to each number, and converts the result to a string. The resulting strings are then joined together with spaces in between to form the final output string.

Output: **a string containing a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, separated by spaces (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
