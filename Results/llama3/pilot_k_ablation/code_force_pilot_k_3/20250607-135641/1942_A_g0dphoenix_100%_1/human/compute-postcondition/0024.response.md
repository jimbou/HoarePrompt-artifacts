The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of lines in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is 2 and `stdin` contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers n and k**
