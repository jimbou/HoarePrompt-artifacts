The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `input()` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `input()` must be greater than 1 and `_` is 1.
State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains one input: an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^3) and then t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), input() is greater than 1, _ is 1**
