Let's break down the code and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`. However, the value of `k` is not used in the print statement. The variable `_` is assigned the value 2, but it is not used in the print statement either.

The print statement is `print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])`. This statement uses the `*` operator to repeat the string `'1 '` `n` times. The `[:-1]` slice is used to remove the last character from the resulting string.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, the repeated string `'1 ' * n` will have a length of `n` characters, with each character being either '1' or ' '. The `[:-1]` slice will remove the last character, which is a space.

Therefore, the output will be a string of `n-1` '1' characters, followed by a space, and then the last '1' character.

Output: **n-1 '1' characters followed by a space and then the last '1' character (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
