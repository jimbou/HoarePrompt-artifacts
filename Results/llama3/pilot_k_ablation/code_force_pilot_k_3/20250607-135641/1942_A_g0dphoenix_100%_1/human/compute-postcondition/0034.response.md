Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains no inputs, _ is t-1. If `n` is equal to `k`, a string of n-1 '1 's is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, "1 2 3 ... n" is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input buffer (stdin) will be empty, and the loop counter `_` will be one less than the initial number of test cases `t`. The values of `n` and `k` will still be within their specified ranges, and the output will depend on the values of `n` and `k` as described in the loop body.
