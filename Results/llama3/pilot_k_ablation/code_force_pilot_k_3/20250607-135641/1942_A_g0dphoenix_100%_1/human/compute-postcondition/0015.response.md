The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads a line of input, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains one input: an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^3) and then t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), the first pair of integers n and k is read and assigned to `n` and `k`.

The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 10^3, and the value of `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.

The value of `_` is still 1, as it is not affected by the code.

The stdin now contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), as the first pair has been read.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**
