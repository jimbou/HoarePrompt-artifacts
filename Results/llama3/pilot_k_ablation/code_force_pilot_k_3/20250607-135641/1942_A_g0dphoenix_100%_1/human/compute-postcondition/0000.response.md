The only variables in the loop head are variable _ and input(). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable input(). If input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and then t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to input() is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **stdin contains two inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and then t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), input() is greater than 0, _ is 0**
