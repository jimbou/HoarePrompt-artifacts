The code prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3. The numbers are separated by spaces.

Since `n` can take any value between 1 and 10^3, the exact output will depend on the specific value of `n`. However, we can describe the output as a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`, with each number separated by a space.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
