Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and then t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), input() is greater than 0, _ is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains one input: an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) and then t-1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
