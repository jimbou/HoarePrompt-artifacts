Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases:

1. When `n` is equal to `k`, it prints a string of `n` ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts are sorted.

2. When `k` is 1, it prints the numbers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted (the one starting with the smallest number).

3. When `k` is greater than 1 and not equal to `n`, it prints -1, which is correct because it is impossible to construct an array that satisfies the condition.

The program correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
