Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases described in the problem statement:

1. If n is equal to k, it prints a sequence of n ones, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the array are sorted.

2. If k is 1, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the array is sorted.

3. If neither of the above conditions is true, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required behavior.

Correctness: **True**
