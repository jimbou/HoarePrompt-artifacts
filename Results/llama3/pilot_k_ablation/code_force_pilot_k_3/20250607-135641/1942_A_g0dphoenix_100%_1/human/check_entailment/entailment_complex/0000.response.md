Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three cases described in the problem statement:

1. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints a sequence of `n` ones, which satisfies the condition that all `n` cyclic shifts are sorted.
2. If `k` is 1, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift is sorted (the one starting with the smallest number).
3. If `n` is not equal to `k` and `k` is not 1, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible input cases. The use of list comprehension and string manipulation is also efficient and readable.

Correctness: **True**
