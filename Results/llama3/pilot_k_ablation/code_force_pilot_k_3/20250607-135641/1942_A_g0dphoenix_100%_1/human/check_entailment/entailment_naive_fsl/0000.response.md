Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k = n - 1. In this case, the program should output a sequence of numbers that are sorted in all cyclic shifts except one, but the program simply outputs -1.

For example, when n = 4 and k = 3, the program should output a sequence like [1, 2, 3, 4] which is sorted in all cyclic shifts except one ([4, 1, 2, 3]). However, the program outputs -1.

The program only handles the cases when k = n or k = 1, but it does not handle the case when k = n - 1 or any other value of k. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
