The function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair consists of a number n and a number k, and prints a sequence of numbers based on the values of n and k. If n is equal to k, it prints a sequence of n-1 ones. If n is not equal to k but k is 1, it prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function continues this process until all input pairs have been processed, at which point standard input is empty.
