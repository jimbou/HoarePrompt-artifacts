Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1 if l2 has more or equal elements than l1, otherwise n is the number of elements in l2, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value divided by 2, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains one element which is the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1 if l2 has more or equal elements than l1, otherwise n is the number of elements in l2, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains two elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2 and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value which is greater than 1, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains three elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
