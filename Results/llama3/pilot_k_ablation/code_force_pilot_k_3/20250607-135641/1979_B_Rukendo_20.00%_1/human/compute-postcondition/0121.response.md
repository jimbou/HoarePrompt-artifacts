Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. The initial value of `cnt` was 0, so after the increment, `cnt` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The relationship between `l1` and `l2` also remains the same, with the current value of `l1[i]` still equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.
