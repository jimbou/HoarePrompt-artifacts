To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and we are still inside the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
