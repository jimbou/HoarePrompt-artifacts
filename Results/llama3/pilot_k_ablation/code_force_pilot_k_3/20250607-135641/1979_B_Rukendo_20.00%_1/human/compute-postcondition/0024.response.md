Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `l1`, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` has one more element than before, which is 0. If the length of `l2` is larger than or equal to the length of `l1`, `l1` has one more element than before if the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, otherwise `l1` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is now equal to the number of elements in `l1`, which is the number of times the loop executed. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input. The lists `l1` and `l2` have the same properties as before, with the possibility of `l2` having one more element than before if its length was less than `l1`, or `l1` having one more element than before if its length was less than `l2`.
