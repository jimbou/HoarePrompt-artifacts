The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is a positive integer equal to half of its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time y must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing one additional element which is the remainder of y divided by 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**
