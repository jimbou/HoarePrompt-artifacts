Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x and an additional 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n, the length of l2 is more than or equal to the length of l1, and the current length of l1 is less than or equal to the length of l2.**

In this output state, the value of l1 has been updated by appending a 0 to its end, which means its length has increased by 1. The value of i has also been updated to n, which is the new length of l1. All other variables remain unchanged.
