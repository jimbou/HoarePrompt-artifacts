Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 contains the binary representation of the original y and an extra 0 at the end, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

In this output state, the value of l2 has been updated to include an extra 0 at the end, while the other variables remain unchanged. The length of l2 is now one more than its original length, but it is still less than the length of l1.
