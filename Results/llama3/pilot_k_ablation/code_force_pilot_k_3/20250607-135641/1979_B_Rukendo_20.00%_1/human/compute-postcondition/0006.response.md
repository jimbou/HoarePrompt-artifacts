Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing two elements, the first element is either 0 or 1, and the second element is either 0 or 1, l2 is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the remainder of x divided by 2 to the list l1. Since x is greater than 0, the remainder will be either 0 or 1. The second line performs integer division of x by 2, effectively dividing x by 2 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. This operation does not affect the values of any other variables. 

After the execution of the code, the value of x is reduced by half, and the list l1 now contains two elements: the original element (either 0 or 1) and the new element (either 0 or 1). The values of t, y, l2, and _ remain unchanged. The state of stdin also remains unchanged, as no input operations are performed in the code snippet.
