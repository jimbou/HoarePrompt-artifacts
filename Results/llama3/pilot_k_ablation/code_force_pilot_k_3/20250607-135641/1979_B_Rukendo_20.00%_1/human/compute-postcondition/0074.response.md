To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`.**
