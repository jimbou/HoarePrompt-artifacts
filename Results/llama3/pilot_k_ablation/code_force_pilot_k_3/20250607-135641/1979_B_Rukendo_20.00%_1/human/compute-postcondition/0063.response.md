Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and has one more element 0 appended to it, `_` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `l1`, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is `n-1`, and the length of `l2` is still less than the length of `l1` but is now one more than its original length.**

In this output state, the value of `l2` has been updated by appending a 0 to it, increasing its length by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The length of `l2` is still less than the length of `l1`, but it has increased by 1.
