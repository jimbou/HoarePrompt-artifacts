Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt is printed, where cnt is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of l1 and l2, or the total number of elements in l1 and l2 if there is no mismatch.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of x becomes 0, and the list l1 contains the binary representation of the original value of x. The other variables remain unchanged.
