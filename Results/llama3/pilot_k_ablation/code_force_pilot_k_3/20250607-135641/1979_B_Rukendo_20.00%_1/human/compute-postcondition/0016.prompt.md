Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element is either 0 or 1, l2 is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer equal to half of its original value, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing one additional element which is the remainder of y divided by 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value divided by 2, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing two additional elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2 and the remainder of y divided by 2 again, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than its original value, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing three elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, the remainder of y divided by 2 again, and the remainder of y divided by 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
