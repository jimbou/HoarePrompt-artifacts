Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed plus one, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1. The current length of l1 is still less than the length of l2.**

In this output state, the value of l1 has been updated by appending 0 to it, increasing its length by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of l1 is still less than the length of l2, and the other conditions in the initial state are still valid.
