The code snippet consists of two lines that are executed in sequence. The first line appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to the list `l2`. Since `y` must be greater than 0, the remainder will be either 0 or 1. The second line performs integer division of `y` by 2, effectively dividing `y` by 2 and rounding down to the nearest whole number.

After executing the entire code block, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).
* `x` remains unchanged, still 0.
* `y` is now half of its original value, since it was divided by 2. Since `y` must be greater than 0, its new value is also greater than 0.
* `l1` remains unchanged, still a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1.
* `l2` now contains one additional element, which is the remainder of `y` divided by 2 (either 0 or 1).
* `_` remains unchanged, still 0.
* `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer equal to half of its original value, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing one additional element which is the remainder of y divided by 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**
