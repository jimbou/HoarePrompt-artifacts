According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, x is a non-negative integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to x is greater than 0.

State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1 if l2 has more or equal elements than l1, otherwise n is the number of elements in l2, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**
