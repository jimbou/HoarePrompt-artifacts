Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer greater than 1 and less than its original value, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing three elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, the remainder of y divided by 2 again, and the remainder of y divided by 2, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

The code modifies the value of y by performing integer division by 2, effectively reducing its value. The remainder of y divided by 2 is appended to list l2. The value of y is updated to be the result of the integer division, which is less than its original value. The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged.
