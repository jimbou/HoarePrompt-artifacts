The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 4 and y currently must be greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time y currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 4 and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 contains the remainder of the original y divided by 2 and the remainder of the original y divided by 4, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**
