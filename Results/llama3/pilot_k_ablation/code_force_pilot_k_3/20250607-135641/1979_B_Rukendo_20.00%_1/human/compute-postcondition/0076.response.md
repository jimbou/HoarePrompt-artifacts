Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`. The current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**

The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The relationship between `l1` and `l2` remains the same, and the current value of `l1[i]` is still equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.
