Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, `x` != `y`).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    l1, l2 = [], []
    while x:
        l1.append(x % 2)
        x //= 2
    while y:
        l2.append(y % 2)
        y //= 2
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        l2.append(0)
    elif len(l1) < len(l2):
        l1.append(0)
    n = len(l1)
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        n = len(l2)
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if l1[i] == l2[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            break
    print(2 ** cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt` is printed, where `cnt` is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of `l1` and `l2`, or the total number of elements in `l1` and `l2` if there is no mismatch

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if `l2` has more or equal elements than `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is equal to the number of matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`. If the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, then the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, the ith element of `l1` is not equal to the ith element of `l2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 2 raised to the power of the number of matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `i` is `n`, `cnt` is equal to the number of matching elements at the beginning of `l1` and `l2`, `l1` contains the binary representation of the original `x` with an extra 0 at the end if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `l1` contains the binary representation of the original `x`, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y` and an extra 0 at the end if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, and 2 raised to the power of the number of matching elements at the beginning of `l1` and `l2` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
