Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of whether `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]` or not. The value of `cnt` is not affected by the break statement, so it remains either 2 or 0, depending on the previous condition.
