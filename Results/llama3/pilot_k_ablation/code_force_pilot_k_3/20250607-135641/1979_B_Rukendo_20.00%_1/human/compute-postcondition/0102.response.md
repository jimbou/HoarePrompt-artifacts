The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of y needed to have been equal or greater than 2 and y currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2 and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 contains the remainder of the original y divided by 2, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**
