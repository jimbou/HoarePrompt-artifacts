The variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing two elements, the first element is either 0 or 1, and the second element is either 0 or 1, l2 is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**
