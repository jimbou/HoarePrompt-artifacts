Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that if `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `break` statement only affects the control flow, but does not change the values of any variables.
