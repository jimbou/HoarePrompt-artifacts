Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `i` is `n`, `cnt` is 0, `l1` contains the binary representation of the original `x` with an extra 0 at the end if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `l1` contains the binary representation of the original `x`, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y` and an extra 0 at the end if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, and `n` is the length of `l1`. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, then `n` is the length of `l2` and `i` is `n-1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and we are still inside the most internal loop or if statement. If `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 3 and we are still inside the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
