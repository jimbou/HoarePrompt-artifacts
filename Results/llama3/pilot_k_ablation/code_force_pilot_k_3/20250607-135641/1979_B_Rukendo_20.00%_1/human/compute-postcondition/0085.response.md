Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `cnt` is 3 if the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, otherwise `cnt` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`. If the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, then the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, the ith element of `l1` is not equal to the ith element of `l2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 3 if the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, otherwise it becomes 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
