Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, l2 has one more element than before, which is 0. If the length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1, l1 has one more element than before if the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, otherwise l1 remains unchanged.***
