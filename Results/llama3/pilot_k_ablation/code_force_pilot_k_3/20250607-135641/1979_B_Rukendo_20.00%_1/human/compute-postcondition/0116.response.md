Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the length of `l2`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, `l1` contains the binary representation of the original `x` with an extra 0 at the end, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y` and an extra 0 at the end, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of `l2`, which is the binary representation of the original `y` with an extra 0 at the end. The value of `i` is still `n-1`, but now `n` refers to the length of `l2` instead of `l1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
