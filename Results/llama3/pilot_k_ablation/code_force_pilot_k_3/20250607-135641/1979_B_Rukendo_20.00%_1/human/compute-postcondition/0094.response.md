Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value divided by 2, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains one element which is the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1 if l2 has more or equal elements than l1, otherwise n is the number of elements in l2, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be its original value divided by 2, and the list `l1` now contains one element which is the remainder of `x` divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The number of lines in stdin has decreased by 1.
