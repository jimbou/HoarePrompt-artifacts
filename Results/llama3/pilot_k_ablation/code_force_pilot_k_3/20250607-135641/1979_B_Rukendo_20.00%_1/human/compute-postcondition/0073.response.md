Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if `l2` has more or equal elements than `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `cnt` which is initialized to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
