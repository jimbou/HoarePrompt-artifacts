Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 4 and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 contains the remainder of the original y divided by 2 and the remainder of the original y divided by 4, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**

The code block modifies the values of `y` and `l2`. The first line appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to `l2`, effectively adding the least significant bit of `y` to the list. The second line performs integer division of `y` by 2, effectively dividing `y` by 2 and discarding the remainder. Since `y` was originally a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2 and greater than 0, after the code executes, `y` becomes a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 4 and still greater than 0. The list `l2` now contains the remainder of the original `y` divided by 2 and the remainder of the original `y` divided by 4. No other variables are affected.
