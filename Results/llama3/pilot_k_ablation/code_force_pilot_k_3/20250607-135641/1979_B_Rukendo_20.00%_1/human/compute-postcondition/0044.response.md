The code prints the result of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`. The value of `cnt` depends on the comparison between the elements of `l1` and `l2`. If all elements of `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements of `l2`, then `cnt` is equal to `n`, which is the number of elements in either `l1` or `l2`, whichever is smaller. Otherwise, `cnt` is equal to the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found.

Since the exact values of `l1` and `l2` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is either the number of elements in `l1` or `l2` (if they are equal) or the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found (if they are not equal).

Output: **2^cnt (where cnt is either n or the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found)**
