Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `l1`, `l2`, `_`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
