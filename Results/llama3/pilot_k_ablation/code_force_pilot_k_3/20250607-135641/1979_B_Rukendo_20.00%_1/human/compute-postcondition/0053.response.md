Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer and greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing three elements: the remainder of x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1**

The code modifies the list l1 by appending the remainder of x divided by 2, and then updates the value of x by performing integer division by 2. The number of elements in l1, denoted by n, remains the same as it was not modified by the code. The value of i is also not modified by the code. All other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
