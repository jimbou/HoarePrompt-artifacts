Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x remains 0, y becomes 0 after being repeatedly divided by 2, l1 remains a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 becomes a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ remains 1, n remains the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, and i remains n-1.
