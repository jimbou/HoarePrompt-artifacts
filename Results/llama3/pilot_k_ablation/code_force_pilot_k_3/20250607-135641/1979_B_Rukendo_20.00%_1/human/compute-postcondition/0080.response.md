The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `cnt` is 1 if the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, otherwise `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`. If the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, then the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, the ith element of `l1` is not equal to the ith element of `l2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
