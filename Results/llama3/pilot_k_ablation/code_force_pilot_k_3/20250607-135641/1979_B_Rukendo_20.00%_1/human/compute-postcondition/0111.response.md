Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x with an additional 0 at the end, l2 contains the binary representation of the original y, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The length of l2 is larger than the length of l1.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list l1 now contains an additional 0 at the end, and the value of i has been incremented to n, which is the new length of l1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
