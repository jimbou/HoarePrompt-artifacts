Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing three elements, the first two elements are either 0 or 1, and the third element is either 0 or 1, l2 is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

Explanation: The first line appends the remainder of x divided by 2 to l1. Since x is greater than 0, the remainder will be either 0 or 1. The second line performs integer division of x by 2, effectively halving its value. The value of x is still greater than 0, but it is now half of its original value. The other variables (t, y, l2, _) remain unchanged.
