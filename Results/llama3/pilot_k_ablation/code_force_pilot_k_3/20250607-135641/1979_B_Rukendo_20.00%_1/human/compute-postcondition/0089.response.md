The code prints the result of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list.

Since `l1` and `l2` contain the binary representation of the original values of `x` and `y`, which are both 0, `l1` and `l2` are both lists containing only '0's.

The number of matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list is equal to the length of the shorter list, because all elements in both lists are '0'.

Since `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`, `n` is the number of elements in `l2`. Therefore, `cnt` is equal to `n`.

So, the code prints 2 raised to the power of `n`, where `n` is the number of elements in `l2`.

Output: **2^n (where n is the number of elements in l2)**
