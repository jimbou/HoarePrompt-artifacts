Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1 if l2 has more or equal elements than l1, otherwise n is the number of elements in l2, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated to the two non-negative integers read from the input. The lists `l1` and `l2` have been reset to empty lists. The value of `n` is now the number of elements in `l1` if `l2` has more or equal elements than `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`. The value of `i` is `n-1`. The value of `cnt` is 0, indicating that there are no matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list. The stdin now contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
