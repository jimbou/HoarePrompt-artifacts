Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input.
