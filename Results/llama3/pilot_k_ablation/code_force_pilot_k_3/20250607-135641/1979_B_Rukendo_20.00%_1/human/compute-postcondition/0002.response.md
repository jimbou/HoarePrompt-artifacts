The code snippet reads two integers `x` and `y` from the first line of stdin and assigns them to the variables `x` and `y`, respectively. It then initializes two empty lists `l1` and `l2`. The variable `_` remains unchanged at 0.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**
