Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 3 and we are still inside the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
