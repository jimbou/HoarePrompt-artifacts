The variable in the loop head is y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than 1 and is now divided by 4. For the loop to be executed one more time, y must be greater than 0 after being divided by 4. So, y must be greater than 4 before being divided by 4.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is greater than 4 and is now divided by 4, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the least significant bit of y and the least significant bit of y divided by 2, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1**
