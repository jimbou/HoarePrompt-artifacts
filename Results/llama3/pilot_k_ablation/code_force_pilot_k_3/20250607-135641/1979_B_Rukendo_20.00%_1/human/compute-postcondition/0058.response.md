Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is greater than 1 and is now divided by 4, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the least significant bit of y and the least significant bit of y divided by 2, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1**

The code modifies the value of y and the list l2. The first line appends the least significant bit of y to l2, and the second line divides y by 2. Since y was greater than 1 and is now divided by 2, it is now divided by 4. The list l2 now contains the least significant bit of y and the least significant bit of y divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
