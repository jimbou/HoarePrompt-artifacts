According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value. Since x is half of its original value, the original value of x must have been greater than 0. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the original value of x must have been greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value which is greater than 1, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains two elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2 and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**
