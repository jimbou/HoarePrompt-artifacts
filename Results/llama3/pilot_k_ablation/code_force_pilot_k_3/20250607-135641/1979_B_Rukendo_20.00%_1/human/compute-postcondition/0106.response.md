Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 contains the binary representation of the original y, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x remains 0, y becomes 0, l1 still contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 now contains the binary representation of the original y, _ remains 2, n remains the number of elements in l1, i remains n-1, cnt remains 0, and stdin still contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
