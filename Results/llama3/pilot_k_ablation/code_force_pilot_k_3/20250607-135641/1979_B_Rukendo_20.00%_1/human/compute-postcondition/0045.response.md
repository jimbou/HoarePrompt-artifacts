The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of `l1` and `l2`, or the total number of elements in `l1` and `l2` if there is no mismatch.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt` is printed, where `cnt` is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of `l1` and `l2`, or the total number of elements in `l1` and `l2` if there is no mismatch**
