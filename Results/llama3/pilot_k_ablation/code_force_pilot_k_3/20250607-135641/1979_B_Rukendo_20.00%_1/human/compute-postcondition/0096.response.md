Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains two elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2 and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the remainder of x divided by 2 to l1. Since l1 originally contained one element which was the remainder of x divided by 2, it now contains two elements, both of which are the remainder of the original x divided by 2. The second line performs integer division of x by 2, effectively halving its value. The value of x is still greater than 0, but it is now half of its original value. No other variables are affected by the code.
