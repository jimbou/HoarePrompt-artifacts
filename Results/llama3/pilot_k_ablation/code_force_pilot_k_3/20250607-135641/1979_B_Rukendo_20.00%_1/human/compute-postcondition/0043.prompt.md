Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is 0. If the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cnt` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is 1. If the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is 2. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
