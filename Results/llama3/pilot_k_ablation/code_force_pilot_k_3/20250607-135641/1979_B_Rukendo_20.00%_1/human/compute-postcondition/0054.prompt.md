Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1 if the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, otherwise n is the number of elements in l2, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt is printed, where cnt is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of l1 and l2, or the total number of elements in l1 and l2 if there is no mismatch
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing one element which is the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt is printed, where cnt is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of l1 and l2, or the total number of elements in l1 and l2 if there is no mismatch
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer and greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing two elements: the remainder of x divided by 2 and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer and greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing three elements: the remainder of x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
