Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 1, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is 0. If the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cnt` remains 0.***
