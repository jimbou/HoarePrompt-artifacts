Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, `cnt` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

In this output state, a new variable `cnt` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.
