The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is `n-1`, and the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt` is printed, where `cnt` is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of `l1` and `l2`, or the total number of elements in `l1` and `l2` if there is no mismatch**
