Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, l2 has one more element 0 appended to it. If the length of l2 is more than or equal to the length of l1, then if the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, an additional 0 is appended to l1 and i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
