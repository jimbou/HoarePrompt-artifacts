According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer and greater than 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer and greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing two elements: the remainder of x divided by 2 and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1**
