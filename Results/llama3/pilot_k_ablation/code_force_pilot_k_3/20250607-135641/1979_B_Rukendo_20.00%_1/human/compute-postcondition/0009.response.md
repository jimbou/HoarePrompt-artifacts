Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element is either 0 or 1, l2 is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable x becomes 0, and the list l1 contains a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, where each element is either 0 or 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
