Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current length of l2 is less than the current length of l1.**
