Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `l1`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

The code assigns the value of `len(l1)` to `n`, which is the number of elements in `l1`. Since `l1` contains the binary representation of the original value of `x`, which is 0, `l1` is `[0]`. Therefore, `n` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
