The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 2, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if `l2` has more or equal elements than `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is equal to the number of matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`. If the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, then the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, the ith element of `l1` is not equal to the ith element of `l2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 2 raised to the power of the number of matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list is printed**
