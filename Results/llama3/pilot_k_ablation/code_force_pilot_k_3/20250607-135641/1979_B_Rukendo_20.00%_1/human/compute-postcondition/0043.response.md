Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is `n-1`. If all elements of `l1` are equal to the corresponding elements of `l2`, then `cnt` is equal to `n`. Otherwise, `cnt` is equal to the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will continue to execute until it has iterated over all elements in `l1` and `l2`. If all elements in `l1` match the corresponding elements in `l2`, the loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the length of the shorter list between `l1` and `l2`. In this case, the value of `cnt` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all elements matched.

If a mismatch is found between an element in `l1` and the corresponding element in `l2`, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `cnt` will be equal to the number of iterations before the mismatch was found.

The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `_`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
