The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains one element which is the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1 if l2 has more or equal elements than l1, otherwise n is the number of elements in l2, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**
