Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t representing the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two distinct non-negative integers x and y. For each test case, it converts x and y into binary representation, compares the binary representations from left to right, and prints 2 raised to the power of the number of matching elements at the beginning of the binary representations. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
