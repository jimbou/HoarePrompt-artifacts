To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. 

Since `n` is the length of `l1`, we need to adjust the state of `l1` to ensure it has at least one element. We also need to adjust the state of `i` to be within the range of `n`.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**
