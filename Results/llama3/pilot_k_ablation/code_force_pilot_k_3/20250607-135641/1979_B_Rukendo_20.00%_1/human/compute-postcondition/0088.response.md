Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 1, `n` is the number of elements in `l1` if `l2` has more or equal elements than `l1`, otherwise `n` is the number of elements in `l2`, `i` is `n-1`, `cnt` is equal to the number of matching elements between `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current value of `l2` has fewer elements than `l1` if `l2` has fewer elements than `l1`. If the ith element of `l1` is equal to the ith element of `l2`, then the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, the ith element of `l1` is not equal to the ith element of `l2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has compared the elements of `l1` and `l2` up to the length of the shorter list, and `cnt` now holds the count of matching elements between the two lists up to that point. The loop has iterated over the range of `n`, which is the length of the shorter list between `l1` and `l2`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `_`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
