Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus one extra 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The current length of l2 is less than or equal to the current length of l1.**

In this output state, the value of l2 has been updated by appending an extra 0 to it. The length of l2 is now either equal to the length of l1 or still less than the length of l1. All other variables remain unchanged.
