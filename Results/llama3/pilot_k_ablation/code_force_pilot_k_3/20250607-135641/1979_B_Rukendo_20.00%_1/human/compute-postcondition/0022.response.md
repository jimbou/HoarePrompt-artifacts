Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. The length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1. If the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, l1 has one more element than before, otherwise l1 remains unchanged.***
