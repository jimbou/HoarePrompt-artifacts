Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `l1` contains at least one element, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, `cnt` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, and we are still inside the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The program is still inside the most internal loop or if statement, and the stdin still contains `t-4` lines of input.
