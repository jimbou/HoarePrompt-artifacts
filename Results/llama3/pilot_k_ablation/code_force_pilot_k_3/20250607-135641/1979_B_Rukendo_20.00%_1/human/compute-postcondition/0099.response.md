Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 is an empty list, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable x becomes 0, and the list l1 contains the binary representation of the original value of x. The other variables remain unchanged.
