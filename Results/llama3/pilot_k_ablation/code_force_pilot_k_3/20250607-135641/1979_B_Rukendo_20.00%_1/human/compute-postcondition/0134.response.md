The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is the number of matching elements at the beginning of `l1` and `l2`. Since `l1` and `l2` contain the binary representations of the original `x` and `y` respectively, `cnt` represents the number of common leading bits in the binary representations of `x` and `y`. 

Output: **2^cnt (where cnt is the number of common leading bits in the binary representations of x and y)**
