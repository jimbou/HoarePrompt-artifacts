Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 8 and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x, l2 contains the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 4, and the remainder of the original y divided by 2, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n-1, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-5 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**

In this output state, the value of y has been divided by 2, and its remainder when divided by 2 has been appended to l2. The value of y is now a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 8, and it is still greater than 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
