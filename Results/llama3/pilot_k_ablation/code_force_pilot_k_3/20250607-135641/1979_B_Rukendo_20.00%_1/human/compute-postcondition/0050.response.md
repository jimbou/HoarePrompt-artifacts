The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is a positive integer and greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, l1 is a list containing one element which is the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, _ is 1, n is the number of elements in l1, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, i is n-1, and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt is printed, where cnt is the number of iterations before the first mismatch was found between the elements of l1 and l2, or the total number of elements in l1 and l2 if there is no mismatch**
