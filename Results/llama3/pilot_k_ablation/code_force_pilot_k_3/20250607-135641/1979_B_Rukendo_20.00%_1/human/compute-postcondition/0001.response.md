The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0 (the first value in the range of `t`). 

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, `x` != `y`), `_` is 0**
