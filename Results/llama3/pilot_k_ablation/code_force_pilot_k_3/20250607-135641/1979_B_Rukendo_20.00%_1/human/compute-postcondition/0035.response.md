To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `n` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 2, stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers, `i` is 1. If the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `cnt` remains 0.**
