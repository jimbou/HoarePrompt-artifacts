To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the variable `y` in the loop head `while y:`. The loop will continue as long as `y` is not zero.

Given that `y` is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value divided by 2, we need to adjust its state so that it remains non-zero for the next iteration.

Since `y` is already a positive integer greater than 1, we don't need to adjust its lower bound. However, we need to ensure that it doesn't become zero after the next iteration.

To achieve this, we can adjust the state of `y` to be greater than 1, so that even if it's divided by 2 again, it will still be non-zero.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer greater than 1, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing two additional elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2 and the remainder of y divided by 2 again, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**
