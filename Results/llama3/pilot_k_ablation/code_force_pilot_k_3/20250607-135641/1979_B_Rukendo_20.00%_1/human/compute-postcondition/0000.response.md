Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, `x` != `y`).**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains `t` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 10^9, `x` != `y`).
