Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value divided by 2, l1 is a list containing a number of elements equal to the number of times the loop executed, each element being either 0 or 1, l2 is a list containing two additional elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2 and the remainder of y divided by 2 again, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers**

In this final state, the value of y has been divided by 2, and the remainder of this division has been appended to list l2. The value of y has been updated to be half of its original value divided by 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
