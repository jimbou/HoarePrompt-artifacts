Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), x is 0, y is 0, _ is 2, n is the number of elements in l1, i is n, cnt is 0, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers. If the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x with an additional 0 at the end and the length of l2 is larger than the length of l1. Otherwise, l1 contains the binary representation of the original x and the length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1.***
