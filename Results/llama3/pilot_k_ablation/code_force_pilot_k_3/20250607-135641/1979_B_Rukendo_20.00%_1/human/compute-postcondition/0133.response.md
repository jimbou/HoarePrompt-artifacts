Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `_` is 2, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is `n-1` if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `i` is `n`, `cnt` is equal to the number of matching elements at the beginning of `l1` and `l2`, `l1` contains the binary representation of the original `x` with an extra 0 at the end if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `l1` contains the binary representation of the original `x`, `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y` and an extra 0 at the end if the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, otherwise `l2` contains the binary representation of the original `y`, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two distinct non-negative integers.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `_`, `l1`, `l2`, and stdin remain unchanged. The variable `n` is still the length of `l1`, and `i` is either `n-1` or `n` depending on the lengths of `l1` and `l2`. The variable `cnt` now holds the count of matching elements at the beginning of `l1` and `l2`.
