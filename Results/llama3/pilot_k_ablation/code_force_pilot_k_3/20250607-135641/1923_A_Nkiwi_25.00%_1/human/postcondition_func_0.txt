This function takes an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) as input, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) and a list of n space-separated integers (0s and 1s) from standard input. The function then counts the number of 1s and 0s in the list and calculates the minimum number of moves required to group all 0s and 1s into separate blocks. If there is only one 1 or no 1s in the list, the function outputs 0. Otherwise, it outputs the number of moves required, which is equal to the number of 0s in the list. The function repeats this process for all test cases and prints the results.
