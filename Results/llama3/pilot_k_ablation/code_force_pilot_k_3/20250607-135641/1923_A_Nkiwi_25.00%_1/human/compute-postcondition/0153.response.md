Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of ones in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs minus 1, `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of the first element of `arrs` is 0. The current value of the last element of `arrs` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The first element of `arrs` is still 0 and the last element of `arrs` is still 0. The number of zeros in `arrs` has decreased by 1.
