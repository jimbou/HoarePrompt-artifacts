The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which depends on the number of ones in the list `arrs`.

Since `cnt1` is the number of ones in `arrs`, if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, which is the number of zeros in `arrs`.

However, based on the precondition, we know that `arrs` must have at least one 1, so `cnt1` is at least 1. Therefore, `ans` will be 0 if `cnt1` is 1, and `cnt0` if `cnt1` is greater than 1.

Since we don't know the exact values of `arrs` and `cnt1`, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we can describe it as follows:

Output: **0 (if cnt1 is 1), cnt0 (if cnt1 is greater than 1)**
