Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is 1, `idx` is 0. The first element of `arrs` is 1. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt0` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `arrs` is still 1, and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is still 0.
