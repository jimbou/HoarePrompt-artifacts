Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, _ is 1, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, idx is n-1, cnt1 is the total number of 1's in arrs. If cnt1 is 1 or 0, then the current value of cnt1 is either 1 or 0. If cnt1 is greater than 1, then cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise no changes are made to cnt0, and ans is equal to cnt0, and the value of ans is printed.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, _ is 1, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, idx is not equal to 0, cnt1 is the total number of 1's in arrs. If cnt1 is 1 or 0, then the current value of cnt1 is either 1 or 0. If cnt1 is greater than 1, then cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise no changes are made to cnt0, and ans is equal to cnt0, and the value of ans is printed. If the current value of arrs[idx] is 0, then cnt0 is increased by 1. If the first element of arrs is not 0 or idx is 0, then either the first element of arrs is not 0 or idx is 0. If the first element of arrs is 1, then no changes are made to cnt0 and ans if the current value of arrs[idx] is not 0. If the current value of arrs[idx] is 0, then the value of ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`*t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of `n+1` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, a_{n+1}` (0 <= `a_i` <= 1) such that at least one `a_i` is 1 and must have at least `n+1` elements, `idx` is not equal to 0 and is increased by 1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1's in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, then `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `cnt0`, and `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the value of `ans` is printed. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0, then either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then no changes are made to `cnt0` and `ans` if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then the value of `ans` is printed. If `arrs[idx]` is 0 and `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt0` and `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`*t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of `n+1` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, a_{n+1}` (0 <= `a_i` <= 1) such that at least one `a_i` is 1 and must have at least `idx+1` elements, `idx` is not equal to 0 and is increased by 1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1's in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, then `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `cnt0`, and `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the value of `ans` is printed. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0, then either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then no changes are made to `cnt0` and `ans` if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then the value of `ans` is printed. If `arrs[idx]` is 0 and `arrs[0]` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt0` and `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
