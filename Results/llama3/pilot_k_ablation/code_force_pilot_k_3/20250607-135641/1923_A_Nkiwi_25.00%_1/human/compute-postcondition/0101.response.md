Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs, and `ans` is equal to 0.**

The value of `ans` is now 0, and the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The first element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1, and the last element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then the last element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then the last element of `arrs` is either 0 or 1.
