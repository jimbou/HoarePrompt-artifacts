Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of ones in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs, `stdin` contains no input. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the value of `ans` is being printed which is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, otherwise it is equal to `cnt0`**
