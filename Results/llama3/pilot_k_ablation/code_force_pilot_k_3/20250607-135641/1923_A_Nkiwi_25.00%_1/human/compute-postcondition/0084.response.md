Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise no changes are made to cnt0, and `ans` is equal to cnt0, and the value of ans is printed. If the current value of arrs[idx] is 0, then cnt0 is increased by 1. If the first element of arrs is not 0 or idx is 0, then either the first element of arrs is not 0 or idx is 0. If the first element of arrs is 1, then no changes are made to cnt0 and ans if the current value of arrs[idx] is not 0. If the current value of arrs[idx] is 0, then the value of ans is printed. If arrs[idx] is 0 and arrs[0] is 0 and idx is not 0, then cnt0 is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to cnt0 and ans.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt1` is reset to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, but the conditions related to `cnt0` and `ans` are updated based on the new value of `cnt1`.
