Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, _ is 2, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, idx is equal to len(arrs), cnt1 is 0, cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs, ans is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of cnt1 has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of cnt0 is still equal to the number of zeros in arrs, and the value of ans is still dependent on the first and last elements of arrs. The stdin still contains no input.
