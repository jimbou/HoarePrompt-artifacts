Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is n-1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1's in `arrs` and is greater than 1, `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `cnt0`, `ans` is 0.***
