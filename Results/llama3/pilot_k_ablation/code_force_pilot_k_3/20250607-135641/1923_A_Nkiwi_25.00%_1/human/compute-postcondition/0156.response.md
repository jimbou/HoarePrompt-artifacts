Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of ones in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of ones in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs, `ans` is 0, and `stdin` contains no input.
