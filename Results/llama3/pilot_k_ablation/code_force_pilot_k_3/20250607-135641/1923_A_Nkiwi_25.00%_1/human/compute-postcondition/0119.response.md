Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is 1, `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs, `stdin` contains no input. Additionally, either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. The current value of the first element of `arrs` is 1. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**

The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1, so the new value of `cnt0` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
