Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0, then if `idx` is not 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made.***
