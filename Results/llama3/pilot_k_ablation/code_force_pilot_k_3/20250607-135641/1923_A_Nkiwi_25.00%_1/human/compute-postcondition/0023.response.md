Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same, and the properties of `length` and `arrs` are still valid. The value of `idx` is still 2, and `_` is still 0.
