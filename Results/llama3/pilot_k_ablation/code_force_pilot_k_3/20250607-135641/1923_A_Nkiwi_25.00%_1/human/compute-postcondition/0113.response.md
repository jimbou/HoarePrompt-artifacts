Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 element, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `idx` is not 0, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1, `stdin` contains no input. The current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0.**
