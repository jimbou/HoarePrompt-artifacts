Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt0` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases, and the list `arrs` still has the same properties as before. The variable `idx` is still 1, and the variable `_` is still 0.
