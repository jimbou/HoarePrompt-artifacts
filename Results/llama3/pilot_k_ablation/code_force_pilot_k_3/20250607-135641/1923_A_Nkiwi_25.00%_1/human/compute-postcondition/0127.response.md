Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, if `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 2, otherwise `cnt0` is 1, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. Otherwise, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs. `stdin` contains no input, `idx` is 2. If `arrs[idx]` is not 0, then the values of `cnt1`, `cnt0`, and `ans` remain unchanged.**
