Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, _ is 2, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, idx is equal to len(arrs), cnt1 is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, cnt0 is 0, ans is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs, stdin contains no input.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `length`, leaving stdin empty. Then, it reads a list of space-separated integers from stdin, assigns it to `arrs`, and empties stdin. The third line initializes `cnt0` to 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `idx`, `cnt1`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
