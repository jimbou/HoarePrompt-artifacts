Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is n-1, `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, or increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise no changes are made, and `cnt1` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt1` has been initialized to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `cnt0` are still dependent on the values of `arrs[0]` and `arrs[idx]`.
