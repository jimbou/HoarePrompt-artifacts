Postcondition: ***`*t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of `n+1` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, a_{n+1}` (0 <= `a_i` <= 1) such that at least one `a_i` is 1 and must have at least `n+1` elements, `idx` is not equal to 0 and is increased by 1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1's in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, then `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `cnt0`, and `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the value of `ans` is printed. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1. If the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0, then either the first element of `arrs` is not 0 or `idx` is 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then no changes are made to `cnt0` and `ans` if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is not 0. If the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, then the value of `ans` is printed. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1.***
