Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, _ is 1, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, idx is not equal to 0, cnt1 is the total number of 1's in arrs. If cnt1 is 1 or 0, then the current value of cnt1 is either 1 or 0. If cnt1 is greater than 1, then cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise no changes are made to cnt0, and ans is equal to cnt0, and the value of ans is printed. The first element of arrs is 0. The current value of arrs[idx] is 0. cnt0 is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains the same, an integer between 2 and 1000 and greater than 1. The value of _ remains the same, which is 1. The value of length remains the same, an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive. The value of arrs remains the same, a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements. The value of idx remains the same, not equal to 0. The value of cnt1 remains the same, the total number of 1's in arrs. If cnt1 is 1 or 0, then the current value of cnt1 is either 1 or 0. If cnt1 is greater than 1, then cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is increased by the number of zeros in arrs if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise no changes are made to cnt0, and ans is equal to cnt0, and the value of ans is printed. The first element of arrs is 0. The current value of arrs[idx] is 0. The value of cnt0 is increased by 1.
