Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than or equal to 0, _ is equal to t, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, idx is equal to len(arrs), cnt1 is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs, stdin contains no input. If cnt1 is 0 or 1, ans is 0. Otherwise, ans is equal to cnt0, and the value of ans is being printed which is either 0 if cnt1 is 0 or 1, otherwise it is equal to cnt0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the loop counter `_` is equal to the total number of test cases `t`, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The input for the test cases has been fully consumed, leaving no input in `stdin`. The variables `length`, `arrs`, `idx`, `cnt1`, and `cnt0` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `ans` holds the result of the last test case, which is either 0 if there is only one 1 in the array or no 1's at all, or the total number of zeros in the array if there are multiple 1's. This result is being printed as the output of the program.
