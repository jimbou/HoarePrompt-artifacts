The only objects in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the idx and arrs. If idx is less than len(arrs), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, idx is 1, arrs has at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the idx is 2 and arrs must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, if `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 0, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. Otherwise, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs. `stdin` contains no input, `idx` is 2**
