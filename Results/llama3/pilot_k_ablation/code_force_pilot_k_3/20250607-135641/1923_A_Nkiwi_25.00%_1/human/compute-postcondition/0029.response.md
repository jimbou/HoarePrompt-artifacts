Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is n-1. If `arrs[0]` is 0, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs`. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `arrs`. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, the loop has counted the number of zeros in the rest of the list and stored it in `cnt0`. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, the loop has counted the total number of zeros in the list and stored it in `cnt0`. The other variables remain unchanged.
