Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, _ is 2, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, idx is equal to len(arrs), cnt1 is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, cnt0 is 0, ans is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 element. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and `idx` is not 0, then `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, if `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 0, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. Otherwise, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is either 0 or 1, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs. `stdin` contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements. `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. `stdin` contains no input, `idx` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 3 elements. `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. If `idx` is not 0 and the first element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. `stdin` contains no input, `idx` is 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
