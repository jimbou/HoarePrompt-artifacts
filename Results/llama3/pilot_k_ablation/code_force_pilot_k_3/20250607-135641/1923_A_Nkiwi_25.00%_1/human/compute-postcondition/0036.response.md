Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1, `cnt1` is 1 plus the initial value of `cnt1` (which is 1 if `arrs[idx]` is 1, otherwise 0), `cnt0` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt1` is increased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `cnt1` is now 1 plus its initial value, which was 1 if the element at index `idx` in `arrs` is 1, and 0 otherwise. All other variables, including `t`, `_`, stdin, `length`, `arrs`, and `idx`, retain their initial values.
