Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, length is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, arrs is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1, cnt0 is 0
Code of the loop:
for idx in range(len(arrs)):
    if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    elif arrs[0] == 1:
        if arrs[idx] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 element. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `idx` is not 0, then if the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt0` remains 0. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the current value of `idx` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1 and `idx` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1. If `arrs[0]` is 0, then if `idx` is not 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2. If `arrs[0]` is 0, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. If `arrs[0]` is 1, then if `arrs[idx]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
