To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `idx` is less than the length of `arrs`. At the end of the previous iteration, `idx` is 1, and `arrs` has at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `idx` must be incremented by 1, so `idx` becomes 2. The length of `arrs` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 3 elements, `idx` is 2**
