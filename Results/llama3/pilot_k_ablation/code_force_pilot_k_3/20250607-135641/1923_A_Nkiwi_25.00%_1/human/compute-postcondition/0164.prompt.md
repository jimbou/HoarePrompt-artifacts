Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 50), and the second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cnt0 = 0
    for idx in range(len(arrs)):
        if arrs[0] == 0 and idx != 0:
            if arrs[idx] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        elif arrs[0] == 1:
            if arrs[idx] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
    cnt1 = 0
    for idx in range(len(arrs)):
        if arrs[idx] == 1:
            cnt1 += 1
    if arrs[0] == 0:
        if arrs[len(arrs) - 1] == 0:
            cnt0 -= 1
    ans = 0
    if cnt1 == 1 or cnt1 == 0:
        ans = 0
    else:
        ans = cnt0
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is n-1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1's in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, then `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `cnt0`, and `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the value of `ans` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `cnt0` and `cnt1` is greater than 1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the answer which is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of ones in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs, `stdin` contains no input. If `cnt1` is 0 or 1, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the value of `ans` is being printed which is either 0 if `cnt1` is 0 or 1, otherwise it is equal to `cnt0`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
