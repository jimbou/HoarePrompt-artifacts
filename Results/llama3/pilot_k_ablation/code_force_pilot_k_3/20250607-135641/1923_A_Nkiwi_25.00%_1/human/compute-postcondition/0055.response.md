The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is n-1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1's in `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then the current value of `cnt1` is either 1 or 0. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, then `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `cnt0`, and `ans` is equal to `cnt0`, and the value of `ans` is printed.**
