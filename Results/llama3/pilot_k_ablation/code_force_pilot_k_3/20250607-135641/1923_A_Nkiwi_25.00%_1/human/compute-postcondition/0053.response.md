The code prints the value of `ans`, which is equal to `cnt0`. The value of `cnt0` depends on the number of 1's in `arrs` and the values of the first and last elements of `arrs`. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then `cnt0` is not changed. If `cnt1` is greater than 1, then `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if the first element of `arrs` is 0 and the last element of `arrs` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if the first element of `arrs` is 1 and the last element of `arrs` is 0, otherwise no changes are made to `cnt0`.

Output: **the value of cnt0 (which is the count of zeros in arrs, excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise the count of zeros in arrs excluding the first element if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise the count of zeros in arrs if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise no changes are made to cnt0)**
