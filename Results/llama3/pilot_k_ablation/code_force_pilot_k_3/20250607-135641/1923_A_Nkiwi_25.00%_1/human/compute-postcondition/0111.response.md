To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `idx` and `arrs`. The loop will execute if `arrs` has at least one element. Since `idx` is the loop variable, it should start from 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 element, `idx` is 0, `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is 0, `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs, `stdin` contains no input**
