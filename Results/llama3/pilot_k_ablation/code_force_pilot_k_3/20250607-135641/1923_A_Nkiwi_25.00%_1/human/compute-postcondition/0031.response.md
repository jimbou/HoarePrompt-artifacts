The only objects in the loop head are variables  idx and list  arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arrs.  If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, idx is n-1. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the idx is 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 elements, `idx` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element if `arrs[0]` is 0 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, or increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` if `arrs[0]` is 1 and `arrs[idx]` is 0, otherwise no changes are made, and `cnt1` is 0**
