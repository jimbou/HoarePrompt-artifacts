The only objects in the loop head are variables  idx and arrs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the idx and arrs.  If the idx is less than the length of arrs the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, idx is not 0, arrs has at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the idx is 1 and arrs must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 2 elements, `idx` is 1**
