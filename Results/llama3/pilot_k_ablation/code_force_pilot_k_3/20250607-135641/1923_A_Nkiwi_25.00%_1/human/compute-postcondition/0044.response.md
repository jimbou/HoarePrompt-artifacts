Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, the first element of `arrs` is 0, `idx` is n-1, `cnt1` is the total number of 1's in `arrs`, and `cnt0` is increased by the number of zeros in `arrs` excluding the first element minus 1, and the last element of `arrs` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been decreased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list `arrs` still contains at least one 1 and has at least n elements, with the first element being 0 and the last element being 0. The index `idx` is still at n-1, and the count of 1's in `arrs` is still stored in `cnt1`.
