Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least n elements, `idx` is equal to len(arrs), `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise cnt0 is equal to the number of zeros in arrs. If `cnt1` is 1 or 0, then `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `cnt0` and `cnt1` is greater than 1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the answer which is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 0 and the last element of arrs is 1, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs minus 1 if the first element of arrs is 1 and the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs)**
