Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 1000 and must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 3 elements. `cnt1` is equal to the number of 1's in arrs. If the first element of `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. If the first element of `arrs` is 1, then `cnt0` is either 1 or 2, and `ans` is either 0 or the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 2 if the last element of arrs is 0, otherwise ans is the number of zeros in arrs excluding the first element minus 1 if the last element of arrs is 1. If `arrs[idx]` is 0, then `cnt0` is either 2 or 3. `stdin` contains no input, `idx` is 3.**
