Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 and must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 inclusive, `arrs` is a list of n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1) such that at least one a_i is 1 and must have at least 1 element, `cnt0` is 1, the first element of `arrs` is 0, and the current value of `idx` is not 0 and the current value of `arrs[idx]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt0` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions.
