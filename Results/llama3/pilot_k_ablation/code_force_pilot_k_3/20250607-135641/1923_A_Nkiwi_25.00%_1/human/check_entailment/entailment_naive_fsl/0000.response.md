Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, consider the input:

```
5
8
0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0
```

The program outputs `1`, but the correct answer is `3`. The program only counts the number of zeros between the first and last ones, but it does not consider the zeros between the ones.

The correct approach is to count the number of zeros between the first and last ones, and then add the number of zeros between the ones. This can be done by iterating through the array and keeping track of the number of zeros between the ones.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        cnt0 = 0
        first_one = -1
        last_one = -1
        for idx in range(len(arrs)):
            if arrs[idx] == 1:
                if first_one == -1:
                    first_one = idx
                last_one = idx
        for idx in range(first_one, last_one):
            if arrs[idx] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        print(cnt0)
```

This program correctly counts the number of zeros between the first and last ones, and then adds the number of zeros between the ones.
