The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than the current iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 2, and stdin contains t-4 inputs. So for the loop to be executed one more time, stdin must contain t-5 inputs and t must be greater than 3.
State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-5 inputs, and t is greater than 3, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is being printed**
