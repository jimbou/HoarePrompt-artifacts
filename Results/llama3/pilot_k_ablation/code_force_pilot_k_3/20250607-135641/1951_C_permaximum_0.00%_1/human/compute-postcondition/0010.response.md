Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-7 inputs, and t is greater than 3, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is being printed**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k. It then reads a list of n positive integers from stdin and assigns it to prices. The function func_1 is called with these values and its output is assigned to result. The result is then printed. The values of n, m, and k are updated to the newly read values, and the list prices is updated to the newly read list of integers. The stdin now contains t-7 inputs, and the result of func_1 is being printed.
