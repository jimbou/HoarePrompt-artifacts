Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-4 inputs, and t is greater than 2**

The code block reads two lines of input from stdin, assigning the values to n, m, and k, and a list of n positive integers to prices. The function func_1 is then called with these values, and its output is assigned to result. The values of n, m, and k are updated to the newly read values, and prices is updated to the newly read list of integers. The value of result is set to the output of func_1. The number of inputs in stdin is reduced by 2.
