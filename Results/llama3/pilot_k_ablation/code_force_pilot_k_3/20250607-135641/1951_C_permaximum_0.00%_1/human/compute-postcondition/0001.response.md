To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` since it is the only variable in the loop head. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 inputs**
