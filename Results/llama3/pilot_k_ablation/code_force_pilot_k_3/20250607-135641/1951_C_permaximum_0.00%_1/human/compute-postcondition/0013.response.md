Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains 0 inputs, and t is greater than or equal to 1, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is printed**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of n, m, k, and prices will be the same as the last iteration of the loop. The result of the last iteration of func_1(n, m, k, prices) will be printed, and there will be no more inputs left in stdin. The value of t will be greater than or equal to 1, indicating that the loop has executed at least once.
