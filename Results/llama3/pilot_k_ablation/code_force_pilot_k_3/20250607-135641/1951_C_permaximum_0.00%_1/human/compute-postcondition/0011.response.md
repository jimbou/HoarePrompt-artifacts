Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the output of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `result`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the function `func_1` with the given inputs `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) (where n, m, k are integers, and prices is a list of n positive integers)**
