Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the output of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-2 inputs**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Since `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `k` is less than or equal to `n*m`, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are updated accordingly. The second line assigns a list of `n` positive integers from the input to `prices`. The third line assigns the output of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)` to `result`. The value of `result` is determined by the function `func_1`, which is not defined in the given code snippet. The number of inputs in stdin is reduced by 2, as two lines of input are consumed by the code.
