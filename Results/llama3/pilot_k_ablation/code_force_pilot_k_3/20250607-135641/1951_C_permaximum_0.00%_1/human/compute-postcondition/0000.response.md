The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. So now stdin only contains `t-1` inputs. The value of `t` is an integer. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, t is an integer, stdin contains t-1 inputs**
