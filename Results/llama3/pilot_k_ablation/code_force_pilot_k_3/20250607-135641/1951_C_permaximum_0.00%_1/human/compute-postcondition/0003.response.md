Based on the precondition, the code will print the result of the function `func_1` with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact output.

However, we can describe the output as the result of the function `func_1` with the given arguments. The function likely processes the input values and returns a value, which is then printed.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) (where n, m, k are positive integers, and prices is a list of n positive integers)**
