Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given the prices of tickets for each day and the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day.

The program uses a greedy approach, sorting the prices of tickets in ascending order and then purchasing the tickets with the lowest prices first. This approach ensures that the minimum amount of money is spent to purchase k tickets.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of tickets to be purchased is less than or equal to the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day. It also correctly handles the case where the number of tickets to be purchased is greater than the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased per day, by purchasing the maximum number of tickets per day until the total number of tickets to be purchased is reached.

The program also correctly updates the prices of tickets for the remaining days after purchasing tickets on a particular day.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the minimum spending to purchase k tickets for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
