Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the prices list, which is not allowed according to the problem description. The problem states that the prices per ticket for each day are given in the order they will be sold, and the program should not change this order.

A correct implementation would involve iterating through the prices list in the order they are given, and at each day, deciding how many tickets to buy to minimize the total cost. This would involve considering the prices for the remaining days and the maximum number of tickets that can be bought each day.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:

    3
    3 2 4
    10 5 1

The program will sort the prices list to [1, 5, 10] and then buy 2 tickets on the first day (which is the cheapest day), 1 ticket on the second day, and 1 ticket on the third day. However, this is not the optimal solution. A better solution would be to buy 2 tickets on the second day (which is the second cheapest day) and 2 tickets on the third day, resulting in a lower total cost.

Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases, and its correctness is **False**.
