Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, with a daily limit of m tickets, given a list of prices per ticket for each day. The prices increase by the number of tickets purchased on each day.

Function 1 (func_1) calculates the minimum spending by sorting the prices and buying tickets at the lowest available prices, considering the daily purchase limit and the total number of tickets to buy. However, this function does not take into account the price increase after purchasing tickets on each day.

Function 2 (func_2) handles input and output for multiple test cases by reading the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads three integers (n, m, k) and a list of n positive integers (prices), calls the func_1 function with these inputs, and prints the result.

However, since func_1 does not correctly model the problem (it does not account for the price increase after purchasing tickets), the overall program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
