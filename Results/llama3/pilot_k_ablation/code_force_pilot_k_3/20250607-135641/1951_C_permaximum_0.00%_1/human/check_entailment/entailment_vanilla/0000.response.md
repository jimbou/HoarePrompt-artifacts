Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, with a maximum of m tickets purchasable each day. The prices per ticket for each day are given in the list a.

Function 1, `func_1`, attempts to solve this problem by sorting the prices in ascending order and then buying as many tickets as possible on the days with the lowest prices. This approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that buying tickets on a day increases the prices for subsequent days.

For example, consider the input `n = 4, m = 2, k = 3` and `prices = [8, 6, 4, 2]`. The correct solution is to buy 1 ticket on the third day (cost 4) and 2 tickets on the fourth day (cost 6), for a total cost of 10. However, `func_1` would sort the prices to `[2, 4, 6, 8]` and buy 2 tickets on the first day (cost 4) and 1 ticket on the second day (cost 6), for a total cost of 10. This is not the optimal solution because it does not take into account the price increase caused by buying tickets on the first day.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
