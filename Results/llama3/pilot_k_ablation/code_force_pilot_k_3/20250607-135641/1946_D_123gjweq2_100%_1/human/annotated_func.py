    #The program returns the result of the function find_new(arr, 30), where arr is a list of non-negative integers and 30 is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= 30 < 2^30.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function find_new takes a list of non-negative integers and a non-negative integer less than 2^30 as input, and returns a result. The purpose of the function is to process the input list and integer, and produce an output based on this processing. The final state of the program is that it returns the result of this processing, without modifying the original input list or integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit` between 0 and 30, and a non-negative integer `x` less than 2^30 as input. It performs bitwise operations on the elements of `cur_arr` and `x`, and recursively calls itself with updated parameters. The function returns the maximum value between the length of a new list `new_arr` and the result of the recursive call, or -1 in certain cases. The function's purpose is to find the maximum value that can be obtained by performing bitwise operations on the input list and integer.
