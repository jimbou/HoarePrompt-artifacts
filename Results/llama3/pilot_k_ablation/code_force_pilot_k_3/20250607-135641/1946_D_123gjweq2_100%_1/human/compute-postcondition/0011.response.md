Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the first element of cur_arr and the previous value of xor.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, and `x` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `xor` is reset to 0. The `new_arr` list now contains the first element of `cur_arr` and the previous value of `xor`, which was the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of `xor` and `i`.
