Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0. The current value of `xor` is 1 at the bit position `bit`, `thing1` is -1**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` has been assigned to -1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
