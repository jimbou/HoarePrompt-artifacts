The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list cur_arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cur_arr.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, cur_arr has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30**
