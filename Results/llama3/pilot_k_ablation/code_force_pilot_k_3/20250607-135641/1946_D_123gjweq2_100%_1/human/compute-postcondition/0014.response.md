Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `cur_arr` remains unchanged, `i` is still the third element in the list, `bit` is still an integer between 0 and 30, and `x` is still a non-negative integer less than 2^30. The only change is that `xor` now holds the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`, which is the third element in the list `cur_arr`.
