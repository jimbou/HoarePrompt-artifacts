Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of `xor` and `i`. If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `cur_arr` remains unchanged, and so do the values of `i`, `bit`, and `x`. The value of `xor` is updated by performing a bitwise XOR operation with the second element `i` of the list `cur_arr`. If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` contains only the first element of `cur_arr`.
