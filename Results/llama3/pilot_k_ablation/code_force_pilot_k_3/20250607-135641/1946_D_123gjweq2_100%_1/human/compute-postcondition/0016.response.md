Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30. If the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i` is 0 at the bit position `bit`, then `xor` is 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of `xor` and `i`. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
