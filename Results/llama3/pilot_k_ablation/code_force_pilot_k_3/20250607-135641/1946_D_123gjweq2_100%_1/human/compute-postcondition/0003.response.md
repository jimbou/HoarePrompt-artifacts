The code initializes two new variables: `new_arr` as an empty list and `xor` as 0. These assignments do not affect the initial state variables `cur_arr`, `bit`, or `x`. The initial state variables remain unchanged as the code snippet does not modify them.

Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0.**
