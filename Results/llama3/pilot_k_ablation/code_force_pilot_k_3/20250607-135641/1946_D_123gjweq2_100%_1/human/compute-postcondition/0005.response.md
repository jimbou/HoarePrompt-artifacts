Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is equal to the first element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial properties, but the value of `xor` has been updated to be equal to the first element in the list `cur_arr`, which is represented by the variable `i`.
