Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between thing1 and the result of the function find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1). thing1 is either -1 or the length of new_arr, which is a list of non-negative integers. The function find_new is called with an empty list cur_arr and an integer bit - 1, where bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30.**
