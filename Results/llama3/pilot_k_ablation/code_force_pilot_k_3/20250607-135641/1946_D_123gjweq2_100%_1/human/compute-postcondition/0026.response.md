Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0. The current value of `xor` is 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`***
