Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of xor and i.**

In this output state, the list new_arr now contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of xor and i. The value of xor has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
