The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and cur_arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cur_arr. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the other variables are still the same. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is 0**
