Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `cur_arr` is empty because all its elements have been processed, `i` is not defined because the loop has finished, `bit` and `x` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop, `new_arr` contains the results of the bitwise XOR operations that had a 0 at the bit position `bit`, and `xor` is 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever a result is appended to `new_arr`.
