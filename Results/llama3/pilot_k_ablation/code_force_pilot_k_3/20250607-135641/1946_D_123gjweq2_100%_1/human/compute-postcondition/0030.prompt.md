You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30.
    if (bit == -1) :
        return len(cur_arr)
        #The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list cur_arr
    #State: *cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, and x is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30. bit is not equal to -1
    new_arr = []
    xor = 0
    for i in cur_arr:
        xor ^= i
        
        if not xor >> bit & 1:
            new_arr.append(xor)
            xor = 0
        
    #State: `cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0.
    if (xor >> bit & 1) :

If the current value of `xor` is 1 at the bit position `bit`, then `thing1` is -1. Otherwise, the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0 and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`.
    if (x >> bit & 1) :
        return max(thing1, find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1))
        #The program returns the maximum value between thing1 and the result of the function find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1). thing1 is either -1 or the length of new_arr, which is a list of non-negative integers. The function find_new is called with an empty list cur_arr and an integer bit - 1, where bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30.
    else :

The value of `bit - 1` is an integer such that -1 <= bit - 1 <= 29, since `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30. The list `new_arr` contains non-negative integers. The function `find_new` is not defined in the given code snippet, so its behavior is unknown. However, the program returns the result of this function call.
        #State: *`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 and `thing1` is -1.
    #State: *`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 and `thing1` is -1.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, which is the value of the variable `thing1`.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the number of non-negative integers in the list cur_arr

Case_2: The program returns the maximum value between thing1 and the result of the function find_new(cur_arr, bit - 1). thing1 is either -1 or the length of new_arr, which is a list of non-negative integers. The function find_new is called with an empty list cur_arr and an integer bit - 1, where bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30.

Case_3: *`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1 and `thing1` is -1.

Case_4: The program returns -1, which is the value of the variable `thing1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
