Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit` between 0 and 30, and a non-negative integer `x` less than 2^30 as input. It performs bitwise operations on the elements of `cur_arr` and `x`, and recursively calls itself with updated parameters. The function returns the maximum value between the length of a new list `new_arr` and the result of the recursive call, or -1 in certain cases. The function's purpose is to find the maximum value that can be obtained by performing bitwise operations on the input list and integer.**
