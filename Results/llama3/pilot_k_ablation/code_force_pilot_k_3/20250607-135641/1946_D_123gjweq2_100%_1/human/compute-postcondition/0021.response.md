Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30, `new_arr` is a list of non-negative integers, `xor` is 0, the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, and `thing1` is the length of `new_arr`**

In this output state, the value of `thing1` is equal to the number of elements in the list `new_arr`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `cur_arr` still being an empty list, `i` still not defined, `bit` still within the range 0 to 30, `x` still a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` still a list of non-negative integers, `xor` still 0, and the bit at position `bit` in `xor` still 0.
