Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of the input string, and the value of `k` will be equal to the number of times the first character of the string (`m`) appears in the string. The other variables (`cnt_test_cases` and `string`) remain unchanged.
