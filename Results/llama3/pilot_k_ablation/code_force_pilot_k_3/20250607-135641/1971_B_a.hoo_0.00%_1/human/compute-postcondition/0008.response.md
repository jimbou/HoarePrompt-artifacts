To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `string`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `string` has at least 1 character. Since `i` is the loop counter, it should be initialized to 0.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of string, `k` is 0**
