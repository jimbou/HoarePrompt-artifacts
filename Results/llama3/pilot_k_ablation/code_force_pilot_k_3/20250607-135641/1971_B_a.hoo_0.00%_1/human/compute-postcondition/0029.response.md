Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.**

The code `string = input().strip()` accepts a new string input from the user, removes leading and trailing whitespaces, and assigns it to the variable `string`. The values of `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, `m`, and `k` are not affected by this code. However, since `m` is the first character of `string` and `k` is the number of occurrences of `m` in `string`, their values may change based on the new input string.
