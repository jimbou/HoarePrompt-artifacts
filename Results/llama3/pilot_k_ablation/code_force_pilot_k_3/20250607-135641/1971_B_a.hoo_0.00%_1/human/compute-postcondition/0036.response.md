The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 0, so the new value of `k` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `string[i]` is still equal to `m`. The value of `i` is still 0. The value of `cnt_test_cases` is still at least 2. The value of `string` is still a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character. The value of `m` is still the first character of `string`.

Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is 1, and `string[i]` is equal to `m`.**
