Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 3 characters, `m` is the first character of the new string. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `k` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` was either 1 or 2 and is now either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `k` remains either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
