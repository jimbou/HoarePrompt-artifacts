To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(string)):`. This means that the only variables that can be adjusted are `i` and `string`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `string`. If `i` is less than the length of `string`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `string` has at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `string` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `cnt_test_cases`, `m`, and `k`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 3 characters, `m` is the first character of the new string. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `k`.**
