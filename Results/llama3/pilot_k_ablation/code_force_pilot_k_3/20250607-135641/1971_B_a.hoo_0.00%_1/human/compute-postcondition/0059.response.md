Output State: **cnt_test_cases is at least 3, i is 1, string is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, m is the first character of the new string, and k is 0.**

The code snippet reassigns the value of `m` to the first character of the `string`, effectively updating its value. However, the value of `k` is reset to 0, losing its previous count of occurrences of `m` in the `string`. The values of `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, and `string` remain unchanged.
