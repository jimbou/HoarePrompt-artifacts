The code `k += 1` increments the value of `k` by 1. Since `k` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`, the new value of `k` will be either 2 or 3.

Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of `string`. If the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 3. Otherwise, `k` is 2.**
