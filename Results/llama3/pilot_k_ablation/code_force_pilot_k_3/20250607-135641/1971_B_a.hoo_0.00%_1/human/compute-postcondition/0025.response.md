The `print` statement is printing the sorted characters of the `string` in ascending order, without any separators or spaces.

Since `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, it contains a sequence of characters.

The `sorted` function is used to sort the characters in the `string` in ascending order. This means that the characters will be arranged in alphabetical order, with uppercase letters coming before lowercase letters.

The `join` function is then used to concatenate the sorted characters into a single string, without any separators or spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a string containing the characters of the original `string`, but in sorted order.

Output: **the sorted characters of the string in ascending order, without any separators or spaces**
