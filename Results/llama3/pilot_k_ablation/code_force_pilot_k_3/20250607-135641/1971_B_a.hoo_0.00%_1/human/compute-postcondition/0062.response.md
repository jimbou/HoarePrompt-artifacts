Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of the new string, `k` is 1, and the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `cnt_test_cases` still being at least 3, `i` still being 1, `string` still being a new string with at least 1 character, `m` still being the first character of the new string, and the current value of `string[i]` still being equal to `m`.
