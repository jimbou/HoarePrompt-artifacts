The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and string, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `string`. If `i` is less than `len(string)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `string` has at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `string` must have at least 2 characters.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 2, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of `string`. If the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, `k` is 1.**
