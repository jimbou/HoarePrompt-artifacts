The `print` statement is printing the sorted characters of the `string` in ascending order, without any separators or spaces. The `sorted` function returns a list of characters in the `string`, and the `join` function concatenates these characters into a single string.

Since the precondition states that `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, the output will be the sorted characters of the input string, without any whitespaces.

For example, if the user inputted the string "hello", the output would be "ehllo". If the user inputted the string "abcde", the output would be "abcde".

Output: **the sorted characters of the input string, without any whitespaces**
