The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `string`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `string`. If `string` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of the new string, and `k` is 0. However, `cnt_test_cases`, `m`, and `k` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust them. `i` is in the loop head, but its value is already 1, which is the initial value for the loop. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `string` to ensure it has at least 1 character.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of the new string, and `k` is 0**
