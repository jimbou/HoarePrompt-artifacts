Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains cnt_test_cases strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters of length at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
    string = input().strip()
    if len(string) == 1:
        print('No')
    m = string[0]
    k = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == m:
            k += 1
    if k == len(string):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
        print(''.join(sorted(string)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in `string`. If `k` is equal to the length of `string`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed and the sorted characters of the string are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in `string`. If `k` is equal to the length of `string`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed and the sorted characters of the string are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of the new string, and `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in `string`. If `k` is equal to the length of `string`, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the sorted characters of the string are printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
