Output State: **cnt_test_cases is at least 2, i is 0, string is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, m is the first character of string, and k is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the first character of `string` to `m`. Since `m` was already equal to the first character of `string` in the initial state, this line does not change the value of `m`. The second line assigns 0 to `k`. Since `k` was equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in `string` in the initial state, this line changes the value of `k` to 0. No other variables are affected.
