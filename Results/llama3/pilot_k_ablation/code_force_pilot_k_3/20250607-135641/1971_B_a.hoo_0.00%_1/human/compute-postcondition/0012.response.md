To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(string)):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the indices of the `string`.

The current state is:

* `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1
* `i` is 0
* `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character
* `m` is the first character of `string`
* `k` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop iterates again. The only variable that changes is `i`, which increments by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

* `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1 (no change)
* `i` is 1 ( incremented by 1)
* `string` is still a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character (no change)
* `m` is still the first character of `string` (no change)
* `k` is still either 0 or 1, depending on whether the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m` (no change, but the value of `string[i]` may be different)

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of `string`. If the current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.**
