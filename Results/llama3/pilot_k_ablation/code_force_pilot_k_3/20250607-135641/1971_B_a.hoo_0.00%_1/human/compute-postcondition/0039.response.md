Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of `string`. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 2. Otherwise, the state of `k` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt_test_cases` remains at least 2, and `i` is still 1. The `string` variable still holds the same string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character. The value of `m` is still the first character of `string`. The value of `k` has been increased by 1. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is now 2. Otherwise, the state of `k` is increased by 1.
