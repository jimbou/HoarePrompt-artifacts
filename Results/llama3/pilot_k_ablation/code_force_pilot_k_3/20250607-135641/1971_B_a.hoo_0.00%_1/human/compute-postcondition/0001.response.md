According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cnt_test_cases`. If `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt_test_cases` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), so it needs to be adjusted to `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, `i` is 0**
