Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case is a string of lowercase English letters. It then checks if the string consists of all the same characters. If the string has only one character or all characters are the same, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the characters of the string in sorted order. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases provided as the first input.**
