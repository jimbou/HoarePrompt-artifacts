To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `len(string)`. Since `string` is not directly modified by the loop head, we only need to consider the increment of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

The state of `string` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop head. The state of `cnt_test_cases` is also unchanged, as it is not related to the loop head.

The state of `m` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, so we cannot adjust its state. However, since `m` is the first character of `string`, its state remains unchanged.

The state of `k` is not explicitly mentioned in the loop head, so we cannot adjust its state. However, since `k` is only updated based on the comparison of the character at index `i` of `string` with `m`, its state remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of `string`. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `k` is unchanged.**
