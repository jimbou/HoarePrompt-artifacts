Output State: **cnt_test_cases is at least 1, i is 0, string is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, m is the first character of string, k is 0.**

The code snippet assigns the first character of the input string to the variable `m` and initializes a new variable `k` to 0. The values of `cnt_test_cases` and `i` remain unchanged. The string remains the same as it was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed.
