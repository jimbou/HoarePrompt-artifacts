Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is equal to the length of `string`, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of the new string, and `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in `string`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of the input string, and the value of `k` will be equal to the total number of occurrences of the first character of the string (`m`) in the entire string. The other variables, `cnt_test_cases` and `string`, remain unchanged.
