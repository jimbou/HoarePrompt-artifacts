Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `string` is a new string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 2 characters, `m` is the first character of the new string, `k` is either 1 or 2**

The code increments the value of `k` by 1. Since `k` was either 0 or 1 initially, its new value is either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
