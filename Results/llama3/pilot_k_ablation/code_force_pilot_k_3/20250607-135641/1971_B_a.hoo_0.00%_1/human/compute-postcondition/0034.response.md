To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `string`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `string`. If `string` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, which is the initial value for the loop variable. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `string` to have at least 1 character.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of `string`, and `k` is 0**
