Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `i` is equal to `cnt_test_cases`, `string` is the last string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed, `m` is the first character of the last string, and `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in the last string. If `k` is equal to the length of the last string, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the sorted characters of the last string are printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `cnt_test_cases` remains unchanged, `i` is equal to the number of test cases, and the variables `string`, `m`, and `k` hold the values corresponding to the last string processed by the loop. The output will be either 'No' or 'Yes' followed by the sorted characters of the last string, depending on whether the first character of the last string appears in all positions of the string.
