Postcondition: ***`cnt_test_cases` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `string` is a string that was inputted by the user with leading and trailing whitespaces removed and has at least 1 character, `m` is the first character of `string`. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `k` is unchanged.***
