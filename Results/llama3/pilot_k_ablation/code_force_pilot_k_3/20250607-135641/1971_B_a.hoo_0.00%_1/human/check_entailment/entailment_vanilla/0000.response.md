Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of rearranging the characters of a given string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string. The program first checks if the length of the string is 1, in which case it is impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string, so it prints 'No'.

Next, the program checks if all characters in the string are the same. If they are, it is also impossible to rearrange the string to form a new string that is not equal to the original string, so it prints 'No'.

If the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, the program prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string. The sorted string is a rearrangement of the original string that is not equal to the original string, because the problem statement guarantees that the input string consists of lowercase English letters, and the sorted string will have the same characters as the original string but in a different order.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem and produces the correct output for all possible inputs.

Correctness: **True**
