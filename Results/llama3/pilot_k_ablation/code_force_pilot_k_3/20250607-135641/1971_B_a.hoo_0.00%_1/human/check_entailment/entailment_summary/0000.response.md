Reasoning:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem's requirements. It checks if the input string consists of all the same characters or has only one character, in which case it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' followed by the characters of the string in sorted order, which is a valid rearrangement of the original string.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string has only one character or all characters are the same, and it correctly generates a rearranged string for all other cases. The use of the sorted function to generate the rearranged string is a simple and efficient approach.

Correctness: **True**
