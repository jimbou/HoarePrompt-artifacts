Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`cnt_test_cases`) and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads a string (`string`) and checks if its length is 1. If so, it prints 'No' because a single-character string cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
3. If the string has more than one character, it checks if all characters are the same by comparing the first character (`m`) with each character in the string and counting the occurrences (`k`). If all characters are the same (`k == len(string)`), it prints 'No' because no rearrangement is possible.
4. If the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, it prints 'Yes' and then prints the characters of the string in sorted order using the `sorted` function and `join` method. This is a valid rearrangement of the original string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* Single-character strings
* Strings with all characters the same
* Strings with more than one character and not all characters the same

The execution states of the program provided as comments match the expected behavior, and the program produces the correct output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
