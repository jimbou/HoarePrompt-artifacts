Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, t is an integer, x is a list of characters, start is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' in x, end is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' in x, stdin contains (n-7) test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `start` and `end`, which are assigned the index of the first 'B' and the index of the last 'B' in the list `x`, respectively. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged as the code does not interact with it.
