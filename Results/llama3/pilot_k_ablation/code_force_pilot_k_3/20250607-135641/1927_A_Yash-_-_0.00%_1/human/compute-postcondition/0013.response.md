Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and is greater than 1, i is 1, t is an integer equal to the second test case, x is a list of characters equal to the third test case, stdin contains (n-4) test cases, start is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' in x, end is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' in x.**

The code snippet consists of two lines, both of which assign values to new variables `start` and `end`. The first line finds the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the list `x` and assigns it to `start`. The second line finds the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the list `x` by reversing the list and finding the index of the first 'B' in the reversed list, then subtracting this index from the length of the list minus one to get the index of the last 'B' in the original list, and assigns it to `end`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `x` remain unchanged, as well as the contents of `stdin`.
