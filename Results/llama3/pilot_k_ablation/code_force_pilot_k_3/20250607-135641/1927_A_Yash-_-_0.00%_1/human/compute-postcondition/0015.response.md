The code prints the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list `x`. Where `x` is a list of characters equal to the third test case, `start` is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' in `x`, and `end` is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' in `x`.
Output: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and is greater than 1, i is 1, t is an integer equal to the second test case, x is a list of characters equal to the third test case, stdin contains (n-4) test cases, start is an integer equal to the index of the first 'B' in x, end is an integer equal to the index of the last 'B' in x, and the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x which is (end - start) is being printed**
