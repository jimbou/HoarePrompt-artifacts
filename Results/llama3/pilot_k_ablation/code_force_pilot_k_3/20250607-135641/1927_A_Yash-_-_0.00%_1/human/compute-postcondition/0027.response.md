Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and is equal to 0, i is (n-1), t is an integer, x is a list of characters, stdin contains 0 test cases. If 'B' is in the list x, the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and the input stream `stdin` will be empty, containing no more test cases. The variables `t` and `x` will hold the values of the last test case. If the last test case contains the character 'B', the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list `x` will be printed. Otherwise, 0 will be printed.
