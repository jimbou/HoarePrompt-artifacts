Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer followed by a string of 'W' and 'B' characters. It then calculates and prints the distance between the first and last occurrence of 'B' in each string, or 0 if there are no 'B' characters. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value, only printing the results for each case.**
