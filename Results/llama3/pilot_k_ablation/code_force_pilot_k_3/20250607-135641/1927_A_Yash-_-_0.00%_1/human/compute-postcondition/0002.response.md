Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and is greater than 0, i is 0, t is an integer equal to the first test case, x is a list of characters equal to the second test case, stdin contains (n-2) test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The value of `t` is assigned the integer value of the first test case from stdin. The value of `x` is assigned a list of characters equal to the second test case from stdin. After the execution of the code, stdin contains (n-2) test cases, as two test cases have been consumed by the code.
