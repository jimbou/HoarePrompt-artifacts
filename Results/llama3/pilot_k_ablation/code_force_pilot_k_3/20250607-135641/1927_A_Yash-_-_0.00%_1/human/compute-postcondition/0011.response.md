To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and is greater than 1, i is 1, t is an integer equal to the second test case, x is a list of characters equal to the third test case, stdin contains (n-3) test cases.**
