The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), stdin contains (n-1) test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), stdin contains (n-1) test cases, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
