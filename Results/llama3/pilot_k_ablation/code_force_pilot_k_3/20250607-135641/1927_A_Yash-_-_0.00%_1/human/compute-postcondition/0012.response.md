Output State: **n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and is greater than 1, i is 1, t is an integer equal to the second test case, x is a list of characters equal to the third test case, stdin contains (n-4) test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified in the code. The value of `t` is updated to be equal to the second test case, which is an integer. The value of `x` is updated to be a list of characters equal to the third test case. The stdin now contains (n-4) test cases, as two test cases have been consumed by the code.
