The code accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. The stdin contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. Since the first input is an integer, it is assigned to `n`. The remaining inputs are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4), stdin contains (n-1) test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by a string s of length n containing only 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
