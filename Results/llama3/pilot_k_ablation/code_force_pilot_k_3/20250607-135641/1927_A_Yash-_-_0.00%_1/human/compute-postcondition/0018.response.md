Postcondition: ***n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4) and is greater than 1, i is 1, t is an integer equal to the second test case, x is a list of characters equal to the third test case, stdin contains (n-4) test cases. If 'B' is in the list x, the difference between the index of the last 'B' and the index of the first 'B' in the list x is printed. Otherwise, 0 is printed.***
