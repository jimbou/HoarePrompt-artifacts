Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.

The program uses the index() method to find the first occurrence of 'B' in the string, and the index() method with slicing to find the last occurrence of 'B'. It then calculates the distance between these two occurrences and prints the result.

The program also handles the case where there are no 'B' characters in the string, in which case it prints 0.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
