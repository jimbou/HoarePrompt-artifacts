Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input numbers have different lengths. For example, if the input is:

3
73
31

The program will throw an error because it tries to access the second element of the shorter number, which does not exist.

The program assumes that the input numbers always have the same length, but the problem description does not guarantee this. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
