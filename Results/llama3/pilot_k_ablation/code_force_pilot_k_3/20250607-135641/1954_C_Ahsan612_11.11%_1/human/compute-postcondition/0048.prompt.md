Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being None, new2 is a list with all elements being None, mid is half the length of a, i is 0, stdin contains 2t - 10 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 2.
Code of the loop:
while i < mid:
    new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a has at least one element, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with the first element being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first element being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], and the rest of the elements being None, mid is half the length of a, i is 1, stdin contains 2t - 10 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 2
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a has at least one element, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with the first two elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], and a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first two elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], and a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, mid is at least 2, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 10 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a has at least one element, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with the first three elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], and a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first three elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], and a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, mid is at least 3, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 10 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 2


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
