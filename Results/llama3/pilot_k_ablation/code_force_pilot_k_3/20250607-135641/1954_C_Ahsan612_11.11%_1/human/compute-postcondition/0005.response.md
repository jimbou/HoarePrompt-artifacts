Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and the length of a is greater than 2, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements up to index i are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements up to index i are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0**

Explanation: The code updates the values of `new` and `new2` lists by comparing the corresponding elements of `a` and `b` at index `i`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
