The only variables in the loop head are variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y. So for the loop to be executed, the input must be at least 1 and _ is now 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0**
