The variable in the loop head is variable i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and a.  If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to mid + 1, and mid is half the length of a. So for the loop to be executed one more time, mid must be less than half the length of a. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], mid is less than half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1**
