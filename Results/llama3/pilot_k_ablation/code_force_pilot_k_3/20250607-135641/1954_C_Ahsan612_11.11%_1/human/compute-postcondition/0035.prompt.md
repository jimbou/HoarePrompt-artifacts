Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1, and the maximum digit at each position between the two input numbers is printed.
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 and i where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1] and the minimum of a[i] and b[i] respectively, new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 and i where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1] and the maximum of a[i] and b[i] respectively, mid is less than half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 2, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 and i where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1] and the minimum of a[i] and b[i] respectively, new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 and i where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1] and the maximum of a[i] and b[i] respectively, mid is less than half the length of a minus 2, i is equal to mid + 3 and i is less than len(a), stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
