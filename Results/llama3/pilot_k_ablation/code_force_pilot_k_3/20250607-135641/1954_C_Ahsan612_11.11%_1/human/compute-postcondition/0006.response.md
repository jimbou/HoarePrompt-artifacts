The only variable in the loop head is variable i and mid, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and mid.  If i is less than mid, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2 and mid is half the length of a, and the length of a is greater than 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, mid must be greater than 2.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line and the length of a is greater than 4, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where the first element is the maximum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements up to index i are the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where the first element is the minimum of the first elements of a and b, and the rest of the elements up to index i are the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0**
