The variable in the loop head is variable i and len(a), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and len(a).  If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is mid + 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time len(a) must be greater than mid + 2.
State: **new is a list with the first mid elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, the mid-th element being the minimum of a[mid] and b[mid], the (mid+1)th element being the minimum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first mid elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, the mid-th element being the maximum of a[mid] and b[mid], the (mid+1)th element being the maximum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], and the rest of the elements being None, i is mid + 2, len(a) must be greater than mid + 2**
