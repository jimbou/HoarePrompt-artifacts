Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the lists 'new' and 'new2' will contain the minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of 'a' and 'b' respectively. The variable 'i' will be equal to the length of 'a' and 'mid' will still be half the length of 'a'. The other variables 'a', 'b', 'stdin', and '_' will remain unchanged.
