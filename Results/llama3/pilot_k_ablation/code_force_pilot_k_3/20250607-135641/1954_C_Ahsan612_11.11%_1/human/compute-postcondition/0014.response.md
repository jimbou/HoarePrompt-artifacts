Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-2 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, the element at index i-1 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the element at index i which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-2 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, the element at index i-1 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the element at index i which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 3, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0, the length of a (and b) must be greater than mid + 3, and i currently must be less than the length of a.**
