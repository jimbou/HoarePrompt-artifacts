Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
    new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0, and the length of a (and b) must be greater than 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the element at index i which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the element at index i which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 2, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0, the length of a (and b) must be greater than 2 * (mid + 2), and i currently must be less than the length of a.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-2 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, the element at index i-1 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the element at index i which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-2 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, the element at index i-1 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, and the element at index i which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 3, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0, the length of a (and b) must be greater than mid + 3, and i currently must be less than the length of a.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
