The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and the length of list a. If i is less than the length of list a, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is mid + 1, so for the loop to be executed one more time, the length of list a must be greater than mid + 1.

State: **new is a list with the first mid elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, the mid-th element being the minimum of a[mid] and b[mid], and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first mid elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, the mid-th element being the maximum of a[mid] and b[mid], and the rest of the elements being None, i is mid + 1, the length of list a must be greater than mid + 1**
