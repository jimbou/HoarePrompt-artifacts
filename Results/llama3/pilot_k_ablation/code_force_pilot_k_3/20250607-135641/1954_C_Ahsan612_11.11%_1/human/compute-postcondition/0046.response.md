The only variable in the loop head is variable i and mid, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and mid.  If i is less than mid, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, mid is at least 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time mid needed to have been at least 3.
State: **a has at least one element, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with the first two elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], and a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first two elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], and a[1] and b[1] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, mid is at least 3, i is 2, stdin contains 2t - 10 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 2**
