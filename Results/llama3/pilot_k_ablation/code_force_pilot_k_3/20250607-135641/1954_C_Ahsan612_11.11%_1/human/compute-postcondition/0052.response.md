Output State: **new is a list with the first mid elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, the mid-th element being the minimum of a[mid] and b[mid], the (mid+1)th element being the minimum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first mid elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, the mid-th element being the maximum of a[mid] and b[mid], the (mid+1)th element being the maximum of a[mid+1] and b[mid+1], and the rest of the elements being None, i is mid + 2**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the minimum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new[i]`. Since `i` is `mid + 1`, this operation modifies the `(mid+1)`th element of `new`. The second line assigns the maximum value between `a[i]` and `b[i]` to `new2[i]`, modifying the `(mid+1)`th element of `new2`. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it `mid + 2`. The rest of the elements in `new` and `new2` remain unchanged, and the length of list `a` is still greater than `mid + 1`.
