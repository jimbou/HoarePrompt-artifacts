Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t, followed by 2t lines of integers x and y. It then compares the digits of x and y, and for each pair of digits, it prints the maximum digit in one line and the minimum digit in another line, repeating this process t times. The function does not return any value but prints the results to the console, leaving stdin empty after execution.**
