The variable in the loop head is variable i and len(a), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and len(a).  If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is equal to mid + 1 and mid is half the length of a, So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of a needed to have been greater than 2 * (mid + 1) and i currently must be less than the length of a.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0, the length of a (and b) must be greater than 2 * (mid + 1), and i currently must be less than the length of a**
