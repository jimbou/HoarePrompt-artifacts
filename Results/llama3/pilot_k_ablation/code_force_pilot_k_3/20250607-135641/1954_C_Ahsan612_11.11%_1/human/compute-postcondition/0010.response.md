Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except for the element at index i-1 which is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0, and the length of a (and b) must be greater than 1.**

In this output state, the values of `new` and `new2` have been modified at index `i-1` (since `i` has been incremented by 1). The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to `mid + 1`. The rest of the information from the precondition remains valid.
