Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The lists 'a' and 'b' remain unchanged, containing the digits from the first and second input lines, respectively.
- The list 'new' contains the maximum values between the corresponding elements of 'a' and 'b'.
- The list 'new2' contains the minimum values between the corresponding elements of 'a' and 'b'.
- The variable 'mid' remains as half the length of 'a'.
- The variable 'i' is equal to 'mid', indicating that the loop has executed 'mid' number of times.
- The 'stdin' remains unchanged, containing 2t - 2 lines, each with an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y.
- The variable '_' remains 0.
