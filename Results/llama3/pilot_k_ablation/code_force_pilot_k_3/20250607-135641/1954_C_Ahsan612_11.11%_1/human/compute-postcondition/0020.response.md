The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, int(input()) is 2t - 2. For the loop to execute again _ is 1 and int(input()) is 2t - 2.
State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 4 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1, and the maximum digit at each position between the two input numbers is printed**
