Output State: **a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 where it is the minimum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, except at index i-1 where it is the maximum of a[i-1] and b[i-1], mid is half the length of a, i is equal to mid + 1, stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1.**

In this final state, the values of `a`, `b`, `mid`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The lists `new` and `new2` are modified at index `i-1` to hold the minimum and maximum of the corresponding elements of `a` and `b`, respectively.
