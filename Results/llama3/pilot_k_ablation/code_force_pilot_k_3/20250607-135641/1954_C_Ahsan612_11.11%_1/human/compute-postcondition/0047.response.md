Output State: **a has at least one element, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with the first three elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], and a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, new2 is a list with the first three elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], and a[2] and b[2] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, mid is at least 3, i is 3, stdin contains 2t - 10 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 2**

The code modifies the lists `new` and `new2` by assigning the maximum and minimum values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` to their third elements, respectively. The variable `i` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected.
