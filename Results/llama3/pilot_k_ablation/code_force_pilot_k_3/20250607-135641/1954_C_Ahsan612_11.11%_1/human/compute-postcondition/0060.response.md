Output State: **_ is t, stdin is empty, and the maximum digits from the two input numbers are printed as a concatenated string for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, the standard input `stdin` will be empty because all input lines have been read, and the maximum digits from each pair of input numbers will have been printed as concatenated strings.
