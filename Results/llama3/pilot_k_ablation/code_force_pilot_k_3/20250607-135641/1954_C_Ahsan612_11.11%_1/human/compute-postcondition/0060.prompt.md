Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by 2t lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    a = list(map(int, list(input())))
    b = list(map(int, list(input())))
    new = [None] * len(a)
    new2 = [None] * len(a)
    mid = len(a) // 2
    i = 0
    while i < mid:
        new[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    while i < len(a):
        new[i] = min(a[i], b[i])
        new2[i] = max(a[i], b[i])
        i += 1
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new))
    print(''.join(str(x) for x in new2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list of values where each element is the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list of values where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to the length of a, stdin contains 2t - 2 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 0, and the maximum digit at each position between the two input numbers is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is a list of digits from the first input line, b is a list of digits from the second input line, new is a list with all elements being the minimum of the corresponding elements of a and b, new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of the corresponding elements of a and b, mid is half the length of a, i is equal to len(a), stdin contains 2t - 6 lines, each containing an integer x or y (1 <= x, y < 10^100) consisting only of digits from 1 to 9, and the length of x is equal to the length of y, _ is 1, and the maximum digits from the two input numbers are printed as a concatenated string

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: new is a list with all elements being the minimum of a and b respectively, new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of a and b respectively, i is len(a), and the string representation of all elements in the list new2 joined together is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
