Output State: **new is a list with all elements being the minimum of a and b respectively, new2 is a list with all elements being the maximum of a and b respectively, i is len(a)**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `new` will contain the minimum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`, and the list `new2` will contain the maximum values of corresponding elements in lists `a` and `b`. The variable `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`.
