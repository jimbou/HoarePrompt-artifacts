The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `len(a)`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is `mid`, so for the loop to execute the first time, `mid` must be less than `len(a)`.

State: **`new` is a list with the first mid elements being the maximum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, `new2` is a list with the first mid elements being the minimum of a[0] and b[0], a[1] and b[1], ..., a[mid-1] and b[mid-1] respectively, and the rest of the elements being None, `i` is mid and mid must be less than len(a)**
