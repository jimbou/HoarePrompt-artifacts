Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and is even, i is 0, ans is a string consisting of the first n/2 uppercase ASCII letters each repeated twice, x is n/2, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), j is n/2-1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is: the string `s` remains unchanged, `t` remains an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` remains an even integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` remains 0, `ans` becomes a string consisting of the first `n/2` uppercase ASCII letters each repeated twice, `x` becomes `n/2`, and `stdin` remains unchanged with `t-1` lines each containing an integer `n` between 1 and 50 inclusive. The loop variable `j` becomes `n/2-1`.
