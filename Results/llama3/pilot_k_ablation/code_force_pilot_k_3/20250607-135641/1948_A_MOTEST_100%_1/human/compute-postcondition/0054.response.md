Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is `t-1`, stdin is empty. If `n` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is being printed, and the string `ans` consisting of the first `n/2` uppercase ASCII letters each repeated twice is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the integer `t` remains unchanged, the integer `n` is the last integer read from the input, the loop counter `i` is one less than `t`, the input stream is empty, and the output is either 'NO' if the last `n` is odd, or 'YES' followed by the string `ans` consisting of the first `n/2` uppercase ASCII letters each repeated twice if the last `n` is even.
