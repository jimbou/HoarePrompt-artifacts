To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for j in range(n // 2):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, even, and greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and is even and is greater than 4, i is 0, ans is a string consisting of the first uppercase ASCII letter repeated twice and the third uppercase ASCII letter repeated twice, x is 2, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), j is 2**
