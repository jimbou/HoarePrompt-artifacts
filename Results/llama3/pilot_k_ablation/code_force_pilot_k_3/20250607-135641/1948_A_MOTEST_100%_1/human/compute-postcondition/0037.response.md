The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is being printed, the string ans containing the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice is being printed, and the variables are updated as follows: ans is the string containing the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice, x is n//2, j is n//2-1.**
