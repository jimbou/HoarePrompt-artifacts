Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer at least 4 and at most 50 inclusive, i is 1, ans is the string containing the first character of s repeated twice, then the second character of s repeated twice, then the third character of s repeated twice, x is 3, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

Explanation: The first line of the code adds the third character of string `s` (which is 'C') repeated twice to the end of string `ans`. The second line increments the value of `x` by 1, making it 3. No other variables are affected by the code.
