Postcondition: ***`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is being printed, the string ans containing the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice is being printed, and the variables are updated as follows: ans is the string containing the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice, x is n//2, j is n//2-1.***
