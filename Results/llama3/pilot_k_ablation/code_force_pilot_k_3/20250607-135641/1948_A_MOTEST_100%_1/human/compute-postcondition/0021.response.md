Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which is the input from the first line of stdin. The values of `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-3 lines each containing an integer n, since one line has been consumed by the input operation.
