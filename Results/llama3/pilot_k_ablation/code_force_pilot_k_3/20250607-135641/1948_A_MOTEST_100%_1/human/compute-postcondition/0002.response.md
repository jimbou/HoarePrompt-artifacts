Output State: **`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to be an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, which is the first line of input from stdin. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `s` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), as one line has been read and assigned to `n`.
