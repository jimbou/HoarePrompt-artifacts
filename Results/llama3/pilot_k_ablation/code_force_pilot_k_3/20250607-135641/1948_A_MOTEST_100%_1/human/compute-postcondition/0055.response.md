Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer t represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer n represents the size of a string to be generated. For each test case, if n is odd, the function prints 'NO'. If n is even, the function prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of the first n/2 uppercase ASCII letters, each repeated twice. The function processes all test cases and empties the standard input.**
