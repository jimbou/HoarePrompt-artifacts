Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, i is 1, ans is an empty string, x is 0, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2):
    ans += s[x] * 2
    x += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer at least 2 and at most 50 inclusive, i is 1, ans is the string containing the first character of s repeated twice, x is 1, j is 0, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer at least 2 and at most 50 inclusive, i is 1, ans is the string containing the first character of s repeated twice, then the second character of s repeated twice, x is 2, j is 1, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, n is an integer at least 4 and at most 50 inclusive, i is 1, ans is the string containing the first character of s repeated twice, then the second character of s repeated twice, then the third character of s repeated twice, x is 3, j is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
