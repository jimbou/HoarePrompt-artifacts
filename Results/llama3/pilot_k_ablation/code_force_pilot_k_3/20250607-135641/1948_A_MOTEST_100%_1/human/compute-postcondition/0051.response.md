Based on the initial state, the string `ans` is constructed by repeating the first `n//2` characters of the string `s` (which contains all uppercase ASCII letters) twice. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and it is equal to the integer read from the first line of stdin.

Since `n` is between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n//2` will be an integer between 0 and 25 inclusive. The first `n//2` characters of the string `s` will be a substring of uppercase ASCII letters, starting from 'A' and ending at the `n//2`-th letter of the alphabet.

The string `ans` is constructed by repeating this substring twice. Therefore, the output will be a string consisting of the first `n//2` uppercase ASCII letters, repeated twice.

Output: **The first [n//2] uppercase ASCII letters repeated twice, where [n//2] is the integer division of n by 2**
