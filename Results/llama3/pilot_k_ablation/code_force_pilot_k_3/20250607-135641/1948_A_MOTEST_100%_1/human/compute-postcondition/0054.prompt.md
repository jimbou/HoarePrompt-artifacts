Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains t lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if n % 2 == 1:
        print('NO')
    else:
        ans, x = '', 0
        x = 0
        for j in range(n // 2):
            ans += s[x] * 2
            x += 1
        print('YES')
        print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is being printed, and the string `ans` consisting of the first n/2 uppercase ASCII letters each repeated twice is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, 'NO' is being printed. If `n` is even, 'YES' is being printed, the string ans containing the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice is being printed, and the variables are updated as follows: ans is the string containing the first n//2 characters of s repeated twice, x is n//2, j is n//2-1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`s` is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, `t` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and is equal to the integer from the first line of stdin, `i` is 2, stdin contains t-5 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). If `n` is odd, the string "NO" is printed. If `n` is even, the string "YES" is printed, and a string `ans` is printed which is a string consisting of the first n//2 characters of `s` repeated twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
