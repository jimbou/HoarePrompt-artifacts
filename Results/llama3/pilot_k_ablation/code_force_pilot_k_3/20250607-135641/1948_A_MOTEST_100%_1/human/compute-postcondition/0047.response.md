Output State: **s is the string of all uppercase ASCII letters, t is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 50, n is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 50, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 lines each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 50), ans is 'AABBCC', x is 3, j is 2**

Explanation:
The code block modifies the variables `ans` and `x`. The first line appends the character at index `x` of string `s` twice to the end of `ans`. Since `x` is initially 2, and `s` contains all uppercase ASCII letters, the character at index 2 is 'C'. Therefore, 'CC' is appended to `ans`, making it 'AABBCC'. The second line increments `x` by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
