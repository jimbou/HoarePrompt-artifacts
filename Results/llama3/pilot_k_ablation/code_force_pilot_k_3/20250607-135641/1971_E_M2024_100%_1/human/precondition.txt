stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second line contains k integers a_i. The third line contains k integers b_i. The following q lines contain single integers d. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, k <= n <= 10^9, and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are non-negative integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}, and b_i < b_{i+1}. d is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= d <= n.
