Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains four inputs: first three integers n, k, and q, and then k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q integers d. n, k, and q are positive integers such that k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n. d is a positive integer such that 0 <= d <= n.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is a positive integer, which is the number of test cases minus one. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and processed. The remaining test cases still have the same structure, with four inputs: three integers n, k, and q, followed by k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q integers d. The constraints on the values of n, k, q, a_i, b_i, and d remain the same.
