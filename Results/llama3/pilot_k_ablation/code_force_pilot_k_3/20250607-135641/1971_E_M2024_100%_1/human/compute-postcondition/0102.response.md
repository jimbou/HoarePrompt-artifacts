Output State: **n, k, q is increased by 1, b, ad, bd, t, v, m is 0, i is 1, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is increased by 1, stdin is empty**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. `m = 0`: Assigns 0 to `m`, overwriting its previous value.
2. `i = 1`: Assigns 1 to `i`, overwriting its previous value.
3. `ql = int(input())`: Reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `ql`. Since `ql` was previously an integer from stdin, this line updates its value.
4. `s = bisect_left(a, ql)`: Finds the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order and assigns it to `s`.

The final state includes all the variables from the initial state, with the following changes:

* `m` is now 0.
* `i` is now 1.
* `ql` has been updated to a new integer value from stdin.
* `s` has been assigned the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order.
* `l` is still increased by 1, as stated in the initial state.
* `n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged.
* Stdin is now empty, as the `int(input())` line has consumed the input.
