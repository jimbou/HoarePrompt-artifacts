Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty except for one input: an integer, t is greater than 1, i is 1, v is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, l is 0, ql is an integer equal to the input, m is 0, and s is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order.**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `t`, `v`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is updated to 1. The value of `ql` is updated to the input integer. The value of `m` is reset to 0. The value of `s` is updated to the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order. Stdin now contains one input: an integer.
