Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `ad` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `v` is a list with two elements, 0 and `ad[1] / bd[1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of the division of the second element of `ad` by the second element of `bd`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
