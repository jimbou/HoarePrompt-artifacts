Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with length q+1, `ad` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `v` is a list with 4 elements, the first element is 0, the second element is ad[1] / bd[1], the third element is ad[2] / bd[2], and the fourth element is ad[3] / bd[3], `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], and `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, where `i` is 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
