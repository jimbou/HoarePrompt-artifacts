Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length q+1, `b` is a list of integers with length q+1, `ad` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with 1 element equal to 0, `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is q, `v` is a list with q+1 elements, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length q+1, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 3, `ad` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with 2 elements, the first element is 0 and the second element is b[1] - b[0], `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `v` is a list with q+1 elements, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length q+1, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 4, `ad` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with 3 elements, the first element is 0, the second element is b[1] - b[0], and the third element is b[2] - b[1], `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `v` is a list with q+1 elements, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length q+1, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 5, `ad` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with 4 elements, the first element is 0, the second element is b[1] - b[0], the third element is b[2] - b[1], and the fourth element is b[3] - b[2], `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `v` is a list with q+1 elements, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
