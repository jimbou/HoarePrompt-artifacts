Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `b` is a list of integers with length q+1, `ad` is a list with 3 elements, the first element is 0, the second element is a[1] - a[0], and the third element is a[2] - a[1], `bd` is a list with 1 element equal to 0, `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `v` is a list with q+1 elements, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the list `ad` has been updated with a new element, which is the difference between the second and first elements of the list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
