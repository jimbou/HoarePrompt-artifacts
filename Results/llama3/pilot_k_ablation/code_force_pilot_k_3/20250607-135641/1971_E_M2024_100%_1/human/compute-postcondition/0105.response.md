Output State: **n, k, q is increased by 1, b, ad, bd, t, v, m is 0, i is 1, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is increased by 1, stdin is empty, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state because the `continue` statement only skips the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and moves to the next iteration, without changing any variable values.
