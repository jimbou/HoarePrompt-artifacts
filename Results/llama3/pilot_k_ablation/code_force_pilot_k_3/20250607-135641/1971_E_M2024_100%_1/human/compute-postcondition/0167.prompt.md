Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `l` is 0, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]` minus `a[s - 1]`, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `t` must be greater than 1, nothing is printed, and `v` is a list containing the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of `a` at index `i` and the difference between consecutive elements of `b` at index `i` for all indices `i` from 1 to the length of `a`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: l is 0, m is m plus b at index s plus the product of bd at index s, ql divided by ad at index s, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, ad is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, t is greater than 1, nothing is printed, v is a list containing the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of a at index i and the difference between consecutive elements of b at index i for all indices i from 1 to the length of a, ql is ql minus a at index s minus 1, and m is printed, where m is m plus b at index s plus the product of bd at index s, ql divided by ad at index s

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: l is 1, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s-1 plus the value of bd at index s times ql divided by ad at index s, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, ad is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, t is greater than 1, nothing is printed, v is a list containing the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of a at index i and the difference between consecutive elements of b at index i for all indices i from 1 to the length of a, ql is an integer input by the user minus the value of a at index s-1, and the value of m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: l is 2, m is greater than 0, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is at least 2, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, ad is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, t is greater than 1, nothing is printed, v is a list containing the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of a at index i and the difference between consecutive elements of b at index i for all indices i from 1 to the length of a, ql is an integer input by the user minus the value of a at index s-1 minus a[s-1], and the value of m which is greater than 0 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
