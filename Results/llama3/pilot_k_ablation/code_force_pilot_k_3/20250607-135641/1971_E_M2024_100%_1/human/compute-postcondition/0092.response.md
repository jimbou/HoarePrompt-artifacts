The only variable in the loop head is variable  l and q, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable l and q. If l is less than q, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is an integer, q is an integer and l is less than q. So for the loop to execute again l is increased by 1.
State: **n, k, q, a, b, ad, bd, stdin, t, i, v, l is increased by 1, m, s, and ql is reduced by the value of a[s - 1]**
