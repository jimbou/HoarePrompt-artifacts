Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length q+1, `b` is a list of integers with length q+1, `ad` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is q, `v` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], and `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n, k, q, a, b, ad, bd, stdin, t, i, v, l, m, and s are integers or lists of integers with specific properties. The value of ql is reduced by the value of a[s - 1]. The value of m is increased by the value of b[s - 1] plus the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], and the value of m is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, k, q, b, ad, bd, t, v, l is increased by 1, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s] minus a[s - 1], i is 1, ql is an integer from stdin, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and this is printed: the value of m which is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s] minus a[s - 1]

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, k, q is increased by 1, b, ad, bd, t, v is 0, i is 1, l is increased by 1, ql is an integer decreased by a[s - 1], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, m is increased by b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], and this is printed: m (where m is the updated value of m which is increased by b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
