Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty, i is 1, v is a list with q+1 elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in ad and bd, l is 2, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `stdin`, `i`, `v`, and `l` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]` from it. The value of `m` is updated by adding `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]` to it. The value of `s` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
