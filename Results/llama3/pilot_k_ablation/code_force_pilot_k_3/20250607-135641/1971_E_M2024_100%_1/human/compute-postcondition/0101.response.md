The only variable in the loop head is variable  l and q, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable l and q. If l is less than q, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, l is increased by 1 and q is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute again l is increased by 1 and q is increased by 1.
State: **n, k, q is increased by 1, b, ad, bd, t, v, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s] minus a[s - 1], i is 1, ql is an integer from stdin, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and this is printed: the value of m which is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s] minus a[s - 1], l is increased by 1**
