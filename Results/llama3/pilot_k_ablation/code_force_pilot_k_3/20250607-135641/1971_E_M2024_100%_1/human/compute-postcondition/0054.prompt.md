Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `ad` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `q`, `v` is a list with `q+1` elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in `ad` and `bd`.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty, i is 1, v is a list with q+1 elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in ad and bd, l is 0, m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus the integer division of bd[s] times ql minus a[s - 1] by ad[s], ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s - 1], s is an integer, and the value of m is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty, i is 1, v is a list with q+1 elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in ad and bd, l is 1, ql is an integer equal to ql minus a[s-1], m is m plus b[s-1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order. If a[s] is equal to ql, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration, and this is printed: m (where m is m plus b[s-1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s])

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 1, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty, i is 1, v is a list with q+1 elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in ad and bd, l is 2, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and this is printed: m (where m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s])




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
