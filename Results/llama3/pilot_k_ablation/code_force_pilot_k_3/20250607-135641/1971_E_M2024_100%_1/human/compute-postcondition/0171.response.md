Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing four inputs: three integers n, k, and q, and then k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q integers d. It processes each test case by calculating the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, and then uses these differences to compute the value of b corresponding to a given query value d. The function prints the computed values for each query in each test case.**
