Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty, i is 1, v is a list with q+1 elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in ad and bd, l is 1, ql is an integer equal to ql minus a[s-1], m is m plus b[s-1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order. If a[s] is equal to ql, then the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.**
