Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 2, `ad` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with two elements where the first element is 0 and the second element is `b[1] - b[0]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, `stdin` remain unchanged. The list `b` also remains unchanged, but the list `bd` has been updated with a new element, which is the difference between the second element of `b` and the first element of `b`. The value of `i` is still 1.
