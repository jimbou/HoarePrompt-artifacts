Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains four inputs: first three integers n, k, and q, and then k integers a_i, k integers b_i, and q integers d. n, k, and q are positive integers such that k <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= k, q <= 10^5. a_i and b_i are strictly increasing sequences of positive integers such that 1 <= a_i <= n, 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a_k = n. d is a positive integer such that 0 <= d <= n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k, q = map(int, input().split())
    a = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    ad = [0]
    bd = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        ad.append(a[i] - a[i - 1])
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        bd.append(b[i] - b[i - 1])
    v = [0]
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        v.append(ad[i] / bd[i])
    for l in range(q):
        m = 0
        i = 1
        ql = int(input())
        s = bisect_left(a, ql)
        if a[s] == ql:
            print(b[s], end=' ')
            continue
        ql -= a[s - 1]
        m += b[s - 1]
        m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
        print(m, end=' ')
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty, i is 0, v is a list with q+1 elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in ad and bd, l is q, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], m is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: l is 0, m is the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s] minus a[s - 1], i is 1, ql is an integer from stdin, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: l is q minus 1, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s-1 plus the value of bd at index s times ql divided by ad at index s, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, ad is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, t is greater than 1, nothing is printed, v is a list containing the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of a at index i and the difference between consecutive elements of b at index i for all indices i from 1 to the length of a, ql is an integer input by the user minus the value of a at index s-1, and the value of m is being printed, and nothing is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
