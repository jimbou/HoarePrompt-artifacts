To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `b` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `b` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop iteration.

The other variables, such as `l`, `m`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, `bd`, `s`, and `t`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`l` is 0, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]` minus `a[s - 1]`, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `t` must be greater than 1, and nothing is printed.**
