Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers with length q+1, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 5, `ad` is a list with q+1 elements, the first element is 0, and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with 4 elements, the first element is 0, the second element is b[1] - b[0], the third element is b[2] - b[1], and the fourth element is b[3] - b[2], `stdin` is empty, `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 3, `v` is a list with q+1 elements, `l` is q, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus a[s - 1], `m` is an integer equal to the sum of b[s - 1] and the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], `s` is an integer equal to the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the length of `b` has increased by 1, and the length of `bd` has also increased by 1. The new element in `bd` is the difference between the third and second elements of `b`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
