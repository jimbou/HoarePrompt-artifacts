Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `q`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `t`, `v`, `l` is increased by 1, `m` is 0, `i` is 1, `ql` is an integer from stdin, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order. If `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
