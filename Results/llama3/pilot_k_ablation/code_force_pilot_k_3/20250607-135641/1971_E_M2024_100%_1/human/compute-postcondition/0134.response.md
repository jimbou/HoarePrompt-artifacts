Output State: **`l` is 0, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]` minus `a[s - 1]`, `i` is at least 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of integers, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `b`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `t` must be greater than 1, nothing is printed, and `v` is a list containing three elements: 0, the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of `a` at index `i` and the difference between consecutive elements of `b` at index `i`, and the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of `a` at index `i` and the difference between consecutive elements of `b` at index `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `v` now has an additional element, which is the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of `a` at index `i` and the difference between consecutive elements of `b` at index `i`.
