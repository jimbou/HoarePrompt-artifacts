Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `ad` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `v` is a list with four elements, 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, and `ad[3] / bd[3]`.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]` to the list, where `i` is 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
