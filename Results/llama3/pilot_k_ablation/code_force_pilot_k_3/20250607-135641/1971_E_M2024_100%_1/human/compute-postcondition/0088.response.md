Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `stdin`, `t`, `i`, `v`, `l`, `ql`, `m`, and `s` are integers or lists of integers with specific properties. If the value of `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, the value of `b[s]` is printed and the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.**
