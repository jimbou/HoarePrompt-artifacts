Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `ad` is a list with four elements where the first element is 0, the second element is `a[1] - a[0]`, the third element is `a[2] - a[1]`, and the fourth element is `a[3] - a[2]`, `bd` is a list with one element equal to 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ad` has been updated by appending the difference between the fourth and third elements of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
