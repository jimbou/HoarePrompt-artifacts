State: **`l` is 0, `m` is the sum of `b[s - 1]` and the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]` minus `a[s - 1]`, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `ad` is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of `a`, `bd` is a list containing 0, `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, and `b[i] - b[i - 1]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `t` must be greater than 1, and nothing is printed.**
