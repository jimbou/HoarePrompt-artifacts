Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 3, `ad` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with four elements where the first element is 0, the second element is `b[1] - b[0]`, the third element is `b[2] - b[1]`, and the fourth element is `b[3] - b[2]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated by appending the difference between `b[3]` and `b[2]` to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
