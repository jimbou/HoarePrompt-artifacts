Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is an integer and must be greater than 0, a is a list of integers with length q+1, b is a list of integers with length q+1, ad is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in a, bd is a list with q+1 elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in b, stdin is empty, i is 1, v is a list with q+1 elements, 0 and the rest of the elements are the divisions of the corresponding elements in ad and bd, l is 0, m is an integer equal to its original value plus b[s - 1] plus the integer division of bd[s] times ql minus a[s - 1] by ad[s], ql is an integer equal to its original value minus a[s - 1], s is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `stdin`, `i`, `v`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `m` is updated by adding `b[s - 1]` and the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` minus `a[s - 1]` by `ad[s]`. The value of `ql` is updated by subtracting `a[s - 1]`. The value of `s` remains unchanged.
