Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `ad` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `b`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `q`, `v` is a list with one element, 0.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except that a new variable `v` is introduced, which is a list containing a single element, 0. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
