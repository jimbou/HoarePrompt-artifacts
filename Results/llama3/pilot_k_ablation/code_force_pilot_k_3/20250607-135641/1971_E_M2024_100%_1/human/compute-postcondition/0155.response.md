Output State: **l is 1, m is the original value of m plus the value of b at index s-1 plus the value of bd at index s times ql divided by ad at index s, i is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, q is at least 1, a is a list of integers, b is a list of integers, ad is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of a, bd is a list containing 0 and the differences between consecutive elements of b, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, t is greater than 1, nothing is printed, v is a list containing the ratio of the difference between consecutive elements of a at index i and the difference between consecutive elements of b at index i for all indices i from 1 to the length of a, ql is an integer input by the user minus the value of a at index s-1.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated by adding the value of `b` at index `s-1` and the product of the value of `bd` at index `s`, `ql`, and the reciprocal of the value of `ad` at index `s`. The value of `ql` has also been updated by subtracting the value of `a` at index `s-1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
