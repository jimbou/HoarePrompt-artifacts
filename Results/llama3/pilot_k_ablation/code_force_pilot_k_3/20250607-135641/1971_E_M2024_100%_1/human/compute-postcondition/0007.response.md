To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` has a length of at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `a` must have a length of at least 3, since `i` is now 3.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length at least 3, `b` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `ad` is a list with three elements where the first element is 0, the second element is `a[1] - a[0]`, and the third element is `a[2] - a[1]`, `bd` is a list with one element equal to 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3**
