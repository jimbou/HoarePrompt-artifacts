Postcondition: ***n, k, q is increased by 1, b, ad, bd, t, v, m is 0, i is 1, ql is an integer, s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, l is increased by 1, stdin is empty. If a[s] is equal to ql, then the rest of the code in the current loop iteration is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration.***
