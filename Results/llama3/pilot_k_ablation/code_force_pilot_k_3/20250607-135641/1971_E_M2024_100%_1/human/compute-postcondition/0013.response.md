Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers with length `q+1`, `b` is a list of integers with length at least 3, `ad` is a list with `q+1` elements where the first element is 0 and the rest of the elements are the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `bd` is a list with three elements where the first element is 0, the second element is `b[1] - b[0]`, and the third element is `b[2] - b[1]`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `ad`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `b` still has a length of at least 3, but the list `bd` now has three elements: the first element is 0, the second element is the difference between the first and second elements of `b`, and the third element is the difference between the second and third elements of `b`.
