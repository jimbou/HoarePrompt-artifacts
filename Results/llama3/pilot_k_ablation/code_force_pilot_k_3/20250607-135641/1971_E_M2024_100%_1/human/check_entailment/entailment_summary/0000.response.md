Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the time it takes for the car to reach a given point d, rounded down to the nearest integer. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads the values of n, k, and q, which represent the final destination, the number of points Timur knows the time for, and the number of queries, respectively.

2.  It then reads the k integers a_i and b_i, which represent the points on the line and the time it takes to reach those points, respectively.

3.  The program calculates the differences between consecutive elements in a and b, which represent the distance and time differences between consecutive points, respectively.

4.  It then calculates the speed of the car between each pair of consecutive points by dividing the distance difference by the time difference.

5.  For each query, the program uses binary search to find the point a_i that is just less than or equal to the query value d.

6.  If the query value d is equal to a point a_i, the program simply prints the corresponding time b_i.

7.  Otherwise, the program calculates the time it takes to reach the query value d by adding the time it takes to reach the previous point a_(i-1) and the time it takes to cover the remaining distance (d - a_(i-1)) at the speed of the car between points a_(i-1) and a_i.

8.  The program prints the computed time for each query in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
