Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It calculates the time it takes for the car to reach each query point by first finding the segment in which the query point lies, then calculating the time it takes to reach the start of that segment, and finally adding the time it takes to reach the query point within that segment.

The program uses binary search to find the segment in which the query point lies, which is efficient. It also correctly calculates the time it takes to reach the query point within a segment by using the formula `m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`, which takes into account the speed of the car in that segment.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including when the query point is at the start or end of a segment, and when the query point is within a segment. It also handles the case when the query point is at point 0, where the time is 0.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the problem description.
