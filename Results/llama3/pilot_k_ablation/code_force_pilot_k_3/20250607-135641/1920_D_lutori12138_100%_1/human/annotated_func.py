#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first two integers represent the number of operations (n) and the number of queries (q), followed by n pairs of integers representing the operations, and finally q integers representing the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the element of list b at index x, where x is the first integer of the original list of integers representing the number of operations (n) and is also an element of list b.
    #State: *x is the first integer of the original list of integers, which represents the number of operations (n), and x is not in b
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is the value at index x in list b, where x is calculated using the first integer of the original list of integers and all elements of list a, if x is in list b. Otherwise, the program returns None.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first integer represents the number of operations, and a list of integers 'a' and 'b' as external references. It returns the element of list 'b' at an index calculated based on the number of operations and the elements of list 'a', if the calculated index exists in list 'b'. If the calculated index does not exist in list 'b', the function returns None. The function effectively maps the input list of integers to a corresponding value in list 'b' based on the provided operations and queries.
