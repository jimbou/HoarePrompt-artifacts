You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first two integers represent the number of operations (n) and the number of queries (q), followed by n pairs of integers representing the operations, and finally q integers representing the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the element of list b at index x, where x is the first integer of the original list of integers representing the number of operations (n) and is also an element of list b.
    #State: *x is the first integer of the original list of integers, which represents the number of operations (n), and x is not in b
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is the value at index x in list b, where x is calculated using the first integer of the original list of integers and all elements of list a, if x is in list b. Otherwise, the program returns None.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns the element of list b at index x, where x is the first integer of the original list of integers representing the number of operations (n) and is also an element of list b.

Case_2: The final output state after the loop executes all iterations is the value at index x in list b, where x is calculated using the first integer of the original list of integers and all elements of list a, if x is in list b. Otherwise, the program returns None.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
