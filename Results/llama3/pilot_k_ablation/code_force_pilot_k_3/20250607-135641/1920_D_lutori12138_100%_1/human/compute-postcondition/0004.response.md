To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `x` is the first integer of the original list of integers, which represents the number of operations (n), and `x` is not in `b`, we can infer that `a` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to ensure it has at least 1 element, and we can also set the initial value of `i` to the first element of `a`.

State: **`x` is the first integer of the original list of integers, which represents the number of operations (n), and `x` is not in `b`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`**
