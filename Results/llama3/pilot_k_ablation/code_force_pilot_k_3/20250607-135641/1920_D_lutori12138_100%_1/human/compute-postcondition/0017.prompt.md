Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *x is the first integer of the original list of integers, which represents the number of operations (n), and x is not in b
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x = (x - 1) % i + 1
    if x in b:
        return b[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is ((the first integer of the original list of integers - 1) % (the first element of `a`)) + 1, `x` is not in `b`, `a` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `a`, and `x` is not in `b`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is ((the first integer of the original list of integers - 1) % (the second element of `a`)) + 1, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `a`. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the value at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is calculated using the first integer of the original list of integers, the second element of list a, and the third element of list a, and is equal to ((the first integer of the original list of integers - 1) % (the second element of `a`)) % (the third element of `a`) + 1, if x is in list b. Otherwise, the program returns None.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
