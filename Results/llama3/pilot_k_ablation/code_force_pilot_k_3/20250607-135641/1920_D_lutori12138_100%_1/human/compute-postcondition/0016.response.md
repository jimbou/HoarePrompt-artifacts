Postcondition: **The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is calculated using the first integer of the original list of integers, the second element of list a, and the third element of list a, and is equal to ((the first integer of the original list of integers - 1) % (the second element of `a`)) % (the third element of `a`) + 1, if x is in list b. Otherwise, the program returns None.**
