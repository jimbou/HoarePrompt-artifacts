Postcondition: ***`x` is ((the first integer of the original list of integers - 1) % (the second element of `a`)) + 1, `a` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element of `a`. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the value at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
