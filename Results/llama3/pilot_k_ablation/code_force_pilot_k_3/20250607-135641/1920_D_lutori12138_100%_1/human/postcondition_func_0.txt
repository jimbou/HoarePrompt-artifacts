This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first integer represents the number of operations, and a list of integers 'a' and 'b' as external references. It returns the element of list 'b' at an index calculated based on the number of operations and the elements of list 'a', if the calculated index exists in list 'b'. If the calculated index does not exist in list 'b', the function returns None. The function effectively maps the input list of integers to a corresponding value in list 'b' based on the provided operations and queries.
