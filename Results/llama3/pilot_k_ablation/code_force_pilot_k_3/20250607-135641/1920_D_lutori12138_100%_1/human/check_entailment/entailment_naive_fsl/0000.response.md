Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the query index is larger than the size of the array after all operations. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct element in the array.

For example, if the input is:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will not be able to correctly handle the query index 20, because the size of the array after all operations is 16, which is less than 20.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to add a check to see if the query index is larger than the size of the array, and if so, return an error message or handle it in some other way that is consistent with the problem description.
