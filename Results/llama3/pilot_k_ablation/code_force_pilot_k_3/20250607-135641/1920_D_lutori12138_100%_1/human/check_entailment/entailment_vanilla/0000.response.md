Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by initializing an empty list `a` and an empty dictionary `b`. The list `a` is used to store the size of the array after each operation, and the dictionary `b` is used to store the value of the elements in the array.
2.  The program then reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d` for each test case.
3.  It then iterates over each operation. If the operation is of type 1 (appending an integer), it increments the size of the array by 1 and stores the value of the element in the dictionary `b`. If the operation is of type 2 (appending copies of the array), it calculates the new size of the array by multiplying the current size by the number of copies plus 1.
4.  After all operations have been processed, the program reverses the list `a` to get the sizes of the array in reverse order.
5.  The program then reads the queries and applies the `resolve_query` function to each query. The `resolve_query` function is not defined in the given code, but it is assumed to be a function that takes a query and returns the corresponding element in the array.
6.  The program then prints the results of the queries.

However, there are a few issues with the given code:

*   The `resolve_query` function is not defined.
*   The `func_1` function is defined but not used anywhere in the code.
*   The program does not handle the case where the size of the array exceeds 10^19.

Despite these issues, the overall logic of the program is correct. It correctly processes the operations and queries, and it uses a dictionary to store the values of the elements in the array.

Correctness: **False**
