Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of array 'a' after a series of operations. The program correctly handles the two types of operations: appending an integer to the end of the array and appending x copies of the array to the end of the array.

The program uses a list 'a' to keep track of the size of the array after each operation and a dictionary 'b' to store the elements of the array. The program iterates over the operations, updating the size of the array and storing the elements in the dictionary.

The program then defines a function 'func_1' to resolve queries. This function takes an integer 'x' as input and returns the element of the array at index 'x'. If 'x' is not a valid index, the function returns None.

The program uses the 'func_1' function to resolve the queries and prints the results.

However, there is a mistake in the program. The function 'func_1' is not defined correctly. The function 'func_1' should be defined as 'resolve_query' instead of 'func_1'. Also, the function 'resolve_query' is not defined in the provided code.

Correctness: **False**
