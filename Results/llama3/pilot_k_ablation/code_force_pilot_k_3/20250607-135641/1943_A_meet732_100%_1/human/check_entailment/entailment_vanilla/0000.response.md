Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
3. It initializes a count array `cntl` of size `n+1` to keep track of the frequency of each element in `a`.
4. It iterates over the elements of `a` and increments the corresponding count in `cntl`.
5. If the count of 0 in `cntl` is 0, it prints 0 as the final score, since the MEX of an empty array is 0.
6. Otherwise, it initializes a variable `c` to the minimum of 2 and the count of 0 in `cntl`. This variable `c` will be used to keep track of the number of times Alice can pick an element without affecting the MEX of `c`.
7. It then iterates over the elements of `cntl` starting from 1. For each element `j`, it checks if the count of `j` is less than 2. If it is, it checks if the count is 0. If it is 0, it prints `j` as the final score, since the MEX of `c` will be `j`. If the count is 1, it decrements `c` by 1. If `c` becomes 0, it prints `j` as the final score.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem. The use of the `cntl` array to keep track of the frequency of each element in `a` is efficient, and the iteration over the elements of `cntl` to find the final score is also efficient.

Correctness: **True**
