The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 2. If cntl[j] is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cntl[j] is not 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
