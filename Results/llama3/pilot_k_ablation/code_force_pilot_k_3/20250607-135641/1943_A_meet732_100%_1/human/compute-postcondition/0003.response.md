The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the first element in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `cntl[i]` is 0, so the new value of `cntl[i]` is 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still a positive integer, `a` is still a list of integers that is not empty, and `i` is still the first element in the list `a`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is 1 and the rest are 0, `i` is the first element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
