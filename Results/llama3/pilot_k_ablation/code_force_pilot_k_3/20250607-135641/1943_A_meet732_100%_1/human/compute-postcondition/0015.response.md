Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 1. The current value of cntl[j] is less than 2***
