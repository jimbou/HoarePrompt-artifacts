To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to have at least one element, and `i` will be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where all elements are 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**
