Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` is decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` is still empty, `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and `cntl` still contains the count of each element in the original list `a`. The last element of the original list `a` is still stored in `i`, and the standard input still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The value of `j` is still 3.
