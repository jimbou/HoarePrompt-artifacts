Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `c` is equal to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0 or `c` is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `c` is 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
