To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, we can conclude that `n` is at least 1.

The initial value of `j` is not explicitly stated, but since the loop starts from 1, we can adjust the state of `j` to be 1.

The other variables, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, and `c`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 1**
