Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cntl[0]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The integer `n` is still at least 1, the list `a` still has at least `n` elements, the list `cntl` still has `n+1` elements where each element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, there are still no inputs in `stdin`, the value of `i` is still the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is still not equal to 0, and the value of `c` is still either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cntl[0]`.
