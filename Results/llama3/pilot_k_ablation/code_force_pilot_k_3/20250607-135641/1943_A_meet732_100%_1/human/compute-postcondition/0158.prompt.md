Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, and `c` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cntl[0]`.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 1 or 2 depending on the value of `cntl[0]`, and `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cntl[j]` is not 0, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `cntl[0]`, the value of `j` which is 1 has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0, `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `cntl[0]` and is one less than its previous value. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0, the value of `j` which is 2 has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `cntl[0]` and is one less than its previous value. If `cntl[j]` is 0 or `c` is False, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
