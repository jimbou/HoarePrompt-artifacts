Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and cntl[0] is not equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `c` is either 1 or 2 because `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0 and `min(2, cntl[0])` will return the minimum value between 2 and `cntl[0]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
