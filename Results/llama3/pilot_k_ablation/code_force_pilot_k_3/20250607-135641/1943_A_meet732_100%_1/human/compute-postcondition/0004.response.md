The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers that is not empty, `i` is the first element in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `a` must have at least 2 elements and the `i` is the second element in the list `a`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is 1 and the rest are 0, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
