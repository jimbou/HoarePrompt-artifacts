Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `c` is decreased by 1. If cntl[j] is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cntl[j] is not 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decreased by 1, but its initial value was unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are still applicable.
