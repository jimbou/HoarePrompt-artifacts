Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is `n`, `c` is either 0 or 1. If cntl[j] is 0 for any j from 1 to n, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `j` is being printed and returned. If cntl[j] is less than 2 and not 0 for any j from 1 to n, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is not zero, nothing changes. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has gone through all the numbers from 1 to `n`. If any of these numbers have a count of 0 in the `cntl` list, the loop breaks and that number is printed and returned. If any of these numbers have a count of 1 in the `cntl` list, the value of `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` becomes 0, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the loop continues until it has gone through all the numbers from 1 to `n`.
