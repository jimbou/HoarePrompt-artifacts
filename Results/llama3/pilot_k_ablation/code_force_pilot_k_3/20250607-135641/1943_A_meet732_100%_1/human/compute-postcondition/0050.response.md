Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 3. If cntl[j] is 0, `c` is decreased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and returned. If cntl[j] is less than 2 and not 0, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is not zero, nothing changes. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
