Output State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same integer value for `n`, the list `a` will have at least `n` elements, the list `cntl` will have counts of each integer in `a` at their respective indices, there will be no inputs in `stdin`, and `i` will be the last element processed from the list `a`.
