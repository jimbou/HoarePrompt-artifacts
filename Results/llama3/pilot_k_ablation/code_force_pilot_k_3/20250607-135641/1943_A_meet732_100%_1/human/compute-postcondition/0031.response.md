Output: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 2. If cntl[j] is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cntl[j] is not 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, and the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed**
