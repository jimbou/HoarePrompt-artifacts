Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that has at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is 3 and the rest are 0, `i` is the third element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**

The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the third element in the list `a`. The initial value of `cntl[i]` is 2, so the new value is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected.
