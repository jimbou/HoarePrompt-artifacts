Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `c` is either -1 or 0 depending on the value of `cntl[0]` and is one less than its previous value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their previous values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `j` which is 3 has been printed.
