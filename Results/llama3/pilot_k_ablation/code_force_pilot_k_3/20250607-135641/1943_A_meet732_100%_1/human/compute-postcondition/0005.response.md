The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the second element in the list `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is 2 and the rest are 0, `i` is the second element in the list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
