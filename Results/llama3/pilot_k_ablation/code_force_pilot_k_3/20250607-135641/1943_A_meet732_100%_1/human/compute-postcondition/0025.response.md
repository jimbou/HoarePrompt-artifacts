Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, `c` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 1, and the current value of cntl[j] is more than or equal to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
