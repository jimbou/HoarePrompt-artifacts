To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `a`, `cntl`, `stdin`, `i`, and `c`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `cntl[0]` and is one less than its previous value.**
