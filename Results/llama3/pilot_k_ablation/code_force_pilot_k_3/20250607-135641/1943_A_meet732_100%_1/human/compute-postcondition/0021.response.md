Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 1. The current value of cntl[j] is more than or equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it is now either 0 or 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The list `cntl` still has n+1 integers, and the value of `cntl[j]` is still more than or equal to 1.
