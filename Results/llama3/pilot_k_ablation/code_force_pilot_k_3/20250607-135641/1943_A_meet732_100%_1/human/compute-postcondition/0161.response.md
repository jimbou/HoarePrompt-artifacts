Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a list of integers. It then finds and prints the smallest positive integer missing from each list. If the list contains all positive integers from 1 to its length, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and produces a list of integers as output, where each integer represents the smallest positive integer missing from the corresponding input list.**
