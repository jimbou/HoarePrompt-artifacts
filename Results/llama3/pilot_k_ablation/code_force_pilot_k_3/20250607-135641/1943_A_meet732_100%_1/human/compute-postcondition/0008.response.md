Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `a` will be empty because the loop iterates over all elements in `a`. The list `cntl` will contain the count of each integer in the original list `a`, where the i-th element in `cntl` represents the count of the integer `i` in `a`. The variable `i` will hold the last element in the original list `a`. The other variables `n` and stdin remain unchanged.
