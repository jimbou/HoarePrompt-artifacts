Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, `c` is 0, and `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is not equal to 0, and the value of `j` which is 1 has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `j` (which is 1) has been printed. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.
