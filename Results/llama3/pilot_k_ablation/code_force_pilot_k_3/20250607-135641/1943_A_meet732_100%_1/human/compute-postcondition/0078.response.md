Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is 0, and `j` is 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, `cntl[0]`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or if statement and continue executing the next line of code.
