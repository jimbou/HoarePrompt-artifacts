Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, the count of 0 in the list `a` is not equal to 0, `c` is 0, and `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is not equal to 0***
