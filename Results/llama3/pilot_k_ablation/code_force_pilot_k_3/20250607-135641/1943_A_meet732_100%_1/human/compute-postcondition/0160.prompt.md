Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 ≤ a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c:
                        print(j)
                        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the value 0 is printed. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, then for `j` from 1 to `n`, if `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and returned. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and not 0, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is not zero, nothing changes. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i (the last element of a) is equal to the length of a and all other elements are 0, i is the last element in the list a. If cntl[0] is 0, 0 is printed. If cntl[0] is not 0, then n must be at least 1, and if cntl[j] is 0 or c is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cntl[j] is not 0 and c is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is equal to the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the last element in the list `a`. If the count of 0 in the list `a` is 0, the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, `n` is at least 1, `j` is `n`, and `c` is either 0 or 1 depending on the value of `cntl[0]` and is one less than its previous value. If `cntl[j]` is 0 or `c` is False, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
