Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, and `cntl[0]` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still 3, and the value of `c` is decreased by 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
