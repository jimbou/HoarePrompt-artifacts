Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where all elements are 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line creates a new list `cntl` of `n+1` zeros. The value of `n` is an integer, and `a` is a list of integers. The list `cntl` has `n+1` elements, all of which are 0. Stdin is now empty.
