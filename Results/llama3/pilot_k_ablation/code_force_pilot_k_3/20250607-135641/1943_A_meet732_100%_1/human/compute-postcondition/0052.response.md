Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. If `cntl[0]` is 0, the value 0 is printed. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, then for `j` from 1 to `n`, if `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and returned. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2 and not 0, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is not zero, nothing changes. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
