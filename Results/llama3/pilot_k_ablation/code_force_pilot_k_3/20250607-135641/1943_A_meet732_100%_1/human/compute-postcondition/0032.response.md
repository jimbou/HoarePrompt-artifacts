Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still 2. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
