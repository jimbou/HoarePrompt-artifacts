Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, and `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
