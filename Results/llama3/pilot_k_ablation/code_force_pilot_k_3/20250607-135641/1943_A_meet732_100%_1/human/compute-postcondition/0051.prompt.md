Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, and cntl[0] is not equal to 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 1. If cntl[j] is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cntl[j] is not 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 2. If cntl[j] is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cntl[j] is not 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed and returned. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer that is at least 3, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the i-th element is the number of times i appears in the original list `a`, `i` is the last element in the original list `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, cntl[0] is not equal to 0, `j` is 3. If cntl[j] is 0, `c` is decreased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and returned. If cntl[j] is less than 2 and not 0, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is not zero, nothing changes. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
