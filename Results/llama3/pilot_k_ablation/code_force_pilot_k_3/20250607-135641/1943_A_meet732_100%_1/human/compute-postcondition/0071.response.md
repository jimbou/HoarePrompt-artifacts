The code prints the value of `j` which is 1.
Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is equal to the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`, and `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is 0, and the value of `j` which is 1 is being printed**
