Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the third element of `a`) is 3 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the third element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `cntl` still has `n+1` elements, but the element at index `i` (which is the third element of `a`) has been updated to 3. The rest of the elements in `cntl` are still 0. The list `a` and the integer `n` are unchanged.
