Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i (the last element of a) is equal to the length of a and all other elements are 0, i is the last element in the list a.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is such that the value of 'n' remains unchanged, the list 'a' remains the same, and the list 'cntl' has its last element (at index 'i', which is the last element of 'a') incremented to the length of 'a', while all other elements of 'cntl' remain 0. The variable 'i' now holds the last element of the list 'a'.
