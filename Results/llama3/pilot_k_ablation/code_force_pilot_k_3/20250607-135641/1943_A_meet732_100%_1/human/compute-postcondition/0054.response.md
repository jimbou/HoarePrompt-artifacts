The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. So now stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin is now empty so we don't include it in the output state. The third line creates a list of n+1 zeros and assigns it to `cntl`.

Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros**
