The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of the element at index `i` in the list `cntl` by 1. Since `i` is the first element in the list `a`, we can say that `i` is an integer.

The list `cntl` initially contains `n+1` zeros. After the increment operation, the value of the element at index `i` in `cntl` will be 1, while the other elements remain 0.

The values of the other variables, `n` and `a`, are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the first element of `a`) is 1 and all other elements are 0, `i` is the first element in the list `a`.**
