Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` (the last element of `a`) is equal to the length of `a` and all other elements are 0, `i` is the last element in the list `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 2, `c` is decreased by 1, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 1, the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cntl` still has `n+1` elements with the last element equal to the length of `a` and all other elements equal to 0, the value of `i` is still the last element in the list `a`, the first element of `cntl` is still not equal to 0, the value of `j` is still 2, the value of `c` has been decreased by 1, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
