Postcondition: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i (the last element of a) is equal to the length of a and all other elements are 0, i is the last element in the list a. If cntl[0] is 0, 0 is printed. If cntl[0] is not 0, then n must be at least 1, and if cntl[j] is 0 or c is 0, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If cntl[j] is not 0 and c is 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
