To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, and `cntl` is a list of `n+1` zeros.

For the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is now the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` zeros, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**
