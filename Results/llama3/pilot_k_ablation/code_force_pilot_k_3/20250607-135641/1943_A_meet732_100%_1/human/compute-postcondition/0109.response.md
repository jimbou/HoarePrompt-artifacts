Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index `i` is 1 and all other elements are 0, `stdin` contains 0 inputs, `i` is the first element in the list `a`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the first element in the list `a`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` now has the element at index `i` as 1, and all other elements are still 0.
