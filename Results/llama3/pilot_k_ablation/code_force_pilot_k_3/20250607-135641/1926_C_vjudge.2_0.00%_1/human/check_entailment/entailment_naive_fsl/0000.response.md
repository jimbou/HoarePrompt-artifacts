Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, but the program only calculates the sum of the digits for the numbers from 0 to 12 and prints the result. It does not take into account the input value n, which is the largest number Vladislav writes.

For example, if the input is 20, the program will still print the sum of the digits for the numbers from 0 to 12, which is not the correct result. The correct result should be the sum of the digits for the numbers from 1 to 20.

To fix this, the program should take the input value n and calculate the sum of the digits for the numbers from 1 to n.
