Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires the program to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given integer n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the numbers from 1 to 12 (hardcoded in the range function), and not for a general n.

The function `func_1` is correct in calculating the sum of the digits of a given integer, but it is not being used correctly in the main part of the program. The main part of the program should read the input n, calculate the sum of the digits of all numbers from 1 to n, and print the result.

Correctness: **False**
