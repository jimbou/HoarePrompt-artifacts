Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits. However, there are several issues with the program that make it incorrect.

1. The program does not read the input from the user. It is supposed to read the number of test cases (t) and then read each test case (n) separately. However, the program does not have any input statements.

2. The program has a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a number `n`. However, this function is not being used correctly. The function is being called in a loop that runs 13 times, but the loop is not related to the input or the problem.

3. The program prints the sum of the results of `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12. However, this is not the correct output. The program should print the sum of the numbers on the board after Vladislav replaces each integer with the sum of its digits, which is a different calculation.

4. The program does not handle the time limit constraint of 0.5 seconds per test. The program's current implementation may not be efficient enough to handle large inputs within the given time limit.

Correctness: **False**
