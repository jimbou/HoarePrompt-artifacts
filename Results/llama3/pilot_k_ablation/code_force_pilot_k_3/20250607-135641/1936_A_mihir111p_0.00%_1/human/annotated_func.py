#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers such that 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, where n is a positive integer.
    print('?', a, b, c, d)
    #This is printed: ? a b c d (where a, b, c, and d are non-negative integers less than n)
    return input()
    #The program returns a string that contains four non-negative integers a, b, c, and d, separated by spaces, where 0 <= a, b, c, d < n, and n is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes four non-negative integers a, b, c, and d as input, prints them in the format '? a b c d', and returns a string containing four non-negative integers separated by spaces, which are the same as the input integers a, b, c, and d. The function does not modify the input integers.
