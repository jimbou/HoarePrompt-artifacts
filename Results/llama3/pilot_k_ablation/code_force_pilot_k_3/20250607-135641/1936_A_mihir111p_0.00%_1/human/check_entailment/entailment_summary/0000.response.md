Reasoning:
The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices i and j in a secret sequence p such that p_i XOR p_j is maximized. The program uses a query function func_1 to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements in the sequence.

The program first finds the index of the maximum element in the sequence by comparing each element with the current maximum. It then finds the indices of all elements that have the same maximum value.

Next, it finds the index of the minimum element among the maximum elements by comparing each pair of maximum elements. This is done to maximize the XOR operation, as XOR of two identical numbers is 0, and XOR of two different numbers is maximized when one number is the maximum and the other is the minimum.

Finally, the program prints the indices of the maximum and minimum elements as the answer.

The execution summary shows that the func_1 function correctly prints the query and returns the result of the comparison.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
