Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find two indices `i` and `j` such that `p_i âŠ• p_j` is maximized, where `p` is a secret permutation of integers from 0 to `n-1`. The program uses a query function `func_1` to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements from the permutation.

The program first finds the index `ans1` of the maximum element in the permutation by comparing each element with the current maximum. Then, it finds the maximum element `mx` among the remaining elements that have the same bitwise OR with `ans1`. The program stores the indices of these maximum elements in the list `v`.

Next, the program finds the index `ans` of the maximum element among the elements in `v` by comparing each element with the current maximum. Finally, it prints the indices `ans` and `ans1` as the solution.

The program uses at most `3n` queries, which is within the allowed limit. The queries are used to compare the bitwise OR of pairs of elements, which is a valid operation according to the problem statement.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
