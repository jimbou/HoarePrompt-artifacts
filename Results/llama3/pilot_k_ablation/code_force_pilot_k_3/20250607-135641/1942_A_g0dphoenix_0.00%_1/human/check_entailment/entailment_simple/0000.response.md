Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n satisfying two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n
2. Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a, exactly k of them are sorted.

The program only checks if n equals k and prints a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) if they are equal, otherwise it prints -1. This solution does not satisfy the second condition of the problem.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints -1, but a valid solution is [69420, 69, 420] as shown in the example output.

Correctness: **False**
