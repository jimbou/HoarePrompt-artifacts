Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. However, the program only checks if `n` equals `k` and prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times if they are equal. This solution is incorrect because it does not consider the case where `k` is less than `n`, which is a valid scenario according to the problem description.

Moreover, the program prints -1 for all cases where `n` does not equal `k`, which is also incorrect. The problem statement guarantees that the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed 10^3, which means that there can be valid solutions for `k` less than `n`.

A correct solution would involve generating an array `a` that satisfies the given conditions for all possible values of `n` and `k`. This might involve using a more complex algorithm or data structure to ensure that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of `a` are sorted.

Correctness: **False**
