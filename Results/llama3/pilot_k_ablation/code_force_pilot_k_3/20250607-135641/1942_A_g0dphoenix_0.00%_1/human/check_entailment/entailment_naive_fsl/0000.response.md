Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program should output a valid array a, but it outputs -1 instead. The correct output for this case should be an array that satisfies the conditions, such as [69420, 69, 420].

The program only handles the case where n = k, and for all other cases, it outputs -1 without attempting to find a valid solution. This is not in line with the problem description, which requires finding a valid array a for any given n and k.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
