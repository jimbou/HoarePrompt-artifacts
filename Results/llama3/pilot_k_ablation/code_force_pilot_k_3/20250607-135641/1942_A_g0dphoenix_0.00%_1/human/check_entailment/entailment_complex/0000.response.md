Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding an array `a` of length `n` such that exactly `k` of its cyclic shifts are sorted. The program only checks if `n` equals `k` and prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times if they are equal, or -1 otherwise.

However, this solution is incomplete and incorrect. It does not consider the case where `k` is less than `n`, which is a valid scenario according to the problem statement. In such cases, the program should find an array `a` that satisfies the condition, but it simply prints -1 without attempting to find a solution.

Furthermore, the program's logic is flawed. Even when `n` equals `k`, the program's solution of printing a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times is not necessarily correct. The problem statement requires that exactly `k` cyclic shifts of the array be sorted, but the program's solution does not guarantee this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
