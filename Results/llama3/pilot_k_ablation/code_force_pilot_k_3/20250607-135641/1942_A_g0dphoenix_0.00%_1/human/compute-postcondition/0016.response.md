State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). If `n` is equal to `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times (excluding the last space) is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.**
