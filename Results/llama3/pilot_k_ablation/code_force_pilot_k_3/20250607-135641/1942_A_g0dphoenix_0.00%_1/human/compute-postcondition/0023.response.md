Output State: **_ is t-1, stdin is empty, and for each iteration, if n equals k, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is printed, otherwise -1 is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop variable `_` will be equal to `t-1`, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. The standard input `stdin` will be empty because all the test cases have been processed. For each iteration, if the value of `n` is equal to `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times (excluding the last space) will be printed, otherwise -1 will be printed.
