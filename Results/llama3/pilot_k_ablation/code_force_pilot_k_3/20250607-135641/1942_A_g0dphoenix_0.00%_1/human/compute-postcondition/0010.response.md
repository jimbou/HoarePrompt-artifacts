Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 10^3, and `k` is between 1 and `n`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, since one line has been read and processed.
