The code prints a string of '1's, repeated `n` times, with each '1' followed by a space, and the last character being removed.
Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, the number of '1's printed will be between 1 and 10^3.
Output: **'1 ' repeated [n] times, where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3**
