The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed  the input() function must return an integer t that is greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), input() function returns an integer t that is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
