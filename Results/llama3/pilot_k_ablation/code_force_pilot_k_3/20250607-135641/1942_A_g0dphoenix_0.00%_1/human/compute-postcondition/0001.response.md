Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin, which contains `t` lines of two integers each. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, as one line has been read and processed.
