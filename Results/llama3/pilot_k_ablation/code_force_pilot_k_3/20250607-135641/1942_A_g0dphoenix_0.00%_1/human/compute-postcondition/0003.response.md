Let's break down the code and the initial state to determine what will be printed.

The initial state tells us that:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3
* `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`
* `_` is 0 (this variable is not used in the code, so we can ignore it)
* stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)
* The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`

The code is:
```python
print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
```
Here's what's happening:

* `('1 ' * n)` creates a string by repeating the string `'1 '` `n` times. For example, if `n` is 3, this would create the string `'1 1 1 '`.
* `[:-1]` is a slice that removes the last character from the string. In this case, it removes the trailing space from the string.

Since the current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, we can substitute `k` for `n` in the code.

So, the code is effectively printing a string of `k` ones, separated by spaces, without a trailing space.

Output: **k ones separated by spaces (where k is the current value of k)**
