This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It calculates a value s based on k and x, and then prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
