Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

The program initializes a variable `s` to 1, which represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee having as many coins as he wants. It then enters a loop that runs `x` times, where `x` is the maximum number of consecutive losses Sasha can afford.

In each iteration of the loop, the program updates `s` by adding the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to bet in order to guarantee having at least `s` coins after the current bet. This is calculated as `s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `k` is the number of times the bet is increased in case of a win.

After the loop, the program checks whether Sasha's initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to `s`. If it is, the program prints "YES", indicating that Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles the edge cases where `x` is 1 and `a` is 1, as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
