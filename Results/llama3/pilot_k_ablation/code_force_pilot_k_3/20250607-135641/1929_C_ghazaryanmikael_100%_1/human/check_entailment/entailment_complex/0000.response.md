Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

* The program correctly reads the input values of k, x, and a for each test case.
* The program calculates the value of s, which represents the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins. The calculation of s is based on the fact that Sasha can lose at most x times in a row, and each time he loses, he needs to increase his bet by a factor of k-1 to recover his losses.
* The program correctly checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins (a) is greater than or equal to the calculated value of s. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The use of the variable s to calculate the minimum required amount of coins is a clever optimization, as it avoids the need to simulate all possible sequences of wins and losses.

Therefore, the program is correct, and it will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
