The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `x-1` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than 0.

State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is an integer greater than 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is 1, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, _ is 1, i is 0**
