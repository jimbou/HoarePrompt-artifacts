Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a, `_` is 1, `i` is x**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `k` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 30.
*   The value of `x` has been decremented to 0 after the loop finishes executing.
*   The value of `a` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^9.
*   The value of `s` has been updated and is now an integer greater than or equal to 5, depending on the initial values of `k` and `x`.
*   The contents of stdin remain unchanged, still containing t-3 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a.
*   The value of `_` remains unchanged, still 1.
*   The value of `i` is now equal to the final value of `x`, which is 0.
