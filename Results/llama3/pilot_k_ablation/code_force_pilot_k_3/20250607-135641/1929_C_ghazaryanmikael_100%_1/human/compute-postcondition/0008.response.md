Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is x plus x times the integer division of 1 by k-1, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9), int(input()) is greater than 0, _ is 0, i is x-1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the value of `x` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The value of `s` is the sum of `x` and `x` times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, which is the result of the loop's execution. The values of `k`, `a`, `stdin`, `int(input())`, and `_` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The value of `i` is `x-1`, which is the last value it took during the loop's execution.
