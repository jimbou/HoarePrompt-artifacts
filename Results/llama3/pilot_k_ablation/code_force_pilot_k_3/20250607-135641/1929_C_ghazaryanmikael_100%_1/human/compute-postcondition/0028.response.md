To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(x):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `x` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

Since `x` is at least 1, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be at least 2.

The other variables `k`, `a`, `s`, and `_` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 2, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 3, `_` is 2, `i` is 2**
