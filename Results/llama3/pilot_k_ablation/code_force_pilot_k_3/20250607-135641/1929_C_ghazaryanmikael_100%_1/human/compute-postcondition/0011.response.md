The only variables in the loop head are variable _ and int(input()). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the int(input()). If int(input()) is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, int(input()) is greater than 0, _ is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time int(input()) must be greater than 1 and _ is 1.
State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is x plus x times the integer division of 1 by k-1, stdin contains t-2 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9), int(input()) is greater than 1, _ is 1, i is x-1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether a is greater than or equal to s**
