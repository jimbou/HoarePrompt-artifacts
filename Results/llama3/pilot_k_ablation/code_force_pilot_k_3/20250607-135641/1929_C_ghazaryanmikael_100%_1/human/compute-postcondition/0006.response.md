The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 4 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= `k` <= 30, 1 <= `x` <= 100, 1 <= `a` <= 10^9), `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 2**
