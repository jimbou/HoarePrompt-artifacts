Output State: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is at least 1, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is at least x + 1, _ is t-1, i is x-1, and the string 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise the string 'NO' is printed, stdin is empty, and int(input()) is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the values of k, x, and a will be the last set of values read from stdin. The value of s will be at least x + 1. The loop counter _ will be t-1, where t is the initial number of test cases. The loop variable i will be x-1. The program will print 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it will print 'NO'. The stdin will be empty, and int(input()) will be 0, indicating that there are no more test cases to process.
