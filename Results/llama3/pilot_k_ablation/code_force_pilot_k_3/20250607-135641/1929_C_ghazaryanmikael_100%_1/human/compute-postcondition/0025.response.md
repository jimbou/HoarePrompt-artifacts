Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be at least 2, since it was initially 1 and has been incremented by at least 1 (due to the addition of `s // (k - 1) + 1`). The other variables remain unchanged.
