To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(x):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `x`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is at least 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The state of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `k`, `a`, `s`, and `_` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is at least 2, `_` is 2, `i` is 1**
