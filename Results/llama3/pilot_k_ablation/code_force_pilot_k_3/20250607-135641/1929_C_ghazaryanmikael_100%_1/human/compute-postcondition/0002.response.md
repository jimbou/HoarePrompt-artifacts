To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= `k` <= 30, 1 <= `x` <= 100, 1 <= `a` <= 10^9), `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
