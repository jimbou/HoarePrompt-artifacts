The code prints 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and s is x plus x times the integer division of 1 by k-1, and x is 0, and k is an integer between 2 and 30.
Output: **k is an integer between 2 and 30, x is 0, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, s is x plus x times the integer division of 1 by k-1, stdin contains t-1 sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9), int(input()) is greater than 0, _ is 0, i is x-1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether a is greater than or equal to s**
