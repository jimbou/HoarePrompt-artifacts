The code prints 'YES' if the value of 'a' is greater than or equal to the value of 's', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of 's' is calculated as x plus x times the integer division of 1 by k-1. Since the value of x is 0, the value of s will also be 0. Therefore, the code will print 'YES' because the value of 'a' is always greater than or equal to 0.

Output: **YES**
