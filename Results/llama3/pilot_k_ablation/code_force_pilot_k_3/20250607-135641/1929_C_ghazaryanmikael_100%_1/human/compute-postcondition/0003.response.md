Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer and must be at least 1, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= `k` <= 30, 1 <= `x` <= 100, 1 <= `a` <= 10^9), `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`. This is because the expression `s // (k - 1)` performs integer division, which rounds down to the nearest whole number. Since `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `k-1` will be an integer between 1 and 29, and the integer division of 1 by `k-1` will be 0. Therefore, `s` is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
