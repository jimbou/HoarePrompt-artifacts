Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 6 plus three times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` sets of three space-separated integers `k`, `x`, and `a` (2 <= `k` <= 30, 1 <= `x` <= 100, 1 <= `a` <= 10^9), `int(input())` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated according to the given code. The initial value of `s` was 4 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, and the code added to `s` the value of `s` divided by `k-1` plus 1. This results in `s` being 6 plus three times the integer division of 1 by `k-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
