The code prints the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order. The `ans` list contains the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop. Since the exact values of `p` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values in the `ans` list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the values of `p` in reverse order.

Output: **the values of p in reverse order (where p is the value of p after each iteration of the loop)**
