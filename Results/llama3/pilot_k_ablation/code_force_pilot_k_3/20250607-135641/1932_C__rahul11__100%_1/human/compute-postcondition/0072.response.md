Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 1 character, `_` is 1. If `strr` is 'R', `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` and the updated value of `p`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. If `strr` is not 'R', `l` is 1 less than its original value, `p` is the value of its original value times `arr[l]` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and the updated value of `p` is appended to `ans`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values except for `ans`, which has an additional element appended to it, which is the current value of `p`. The value of `p` is updated based on the value of `strr`. If `strr` is 'R', `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m` and `r` is incremented by 1. If `strr` is not 'R', `l` is decremented by 1 and `p` is updated to `p * arr[l] % m`.
