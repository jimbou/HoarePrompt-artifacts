Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a non-empty string, ans is an empty list, _ is 1, p is equal to (p * arr[l-1]) % m, l is -1, r is n, strr is the last character of s and strr is not equal to 'R'**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, `_`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `l` is decremented by 1, making it -1. The value of `p` is updated to be the result of `(p * arr[l-1]) % m`, where `l-1` is used because `l` is now -1. The value of `strr` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
