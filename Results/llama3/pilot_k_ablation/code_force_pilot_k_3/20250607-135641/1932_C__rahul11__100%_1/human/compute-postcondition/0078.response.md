To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `k` and the string `s`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the values of other variables remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed, the string `s` must have at least 1 character and `k` is the first character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `k` is the first character in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 1`**
