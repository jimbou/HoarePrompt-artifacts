Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a non-empty string with at least 1 character, _ is 1, l is 1 less than its original value, p is the value of its original value times arr[l] modulo m, and ans is a list containing the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if strr is 'R' otherwise p * arr[l] % m, and the updated value of p is appended to ans**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the product of its original value and `arr[l]`, taken modulo `m`. The list `ans` now contains the updated value of `p` appended to its original contents. All other variables remain unchanged.
