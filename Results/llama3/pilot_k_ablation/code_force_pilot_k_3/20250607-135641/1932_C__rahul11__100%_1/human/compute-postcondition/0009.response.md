Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is the second character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n` - 1. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` - 2. In both cases, `_` is 0 and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `l` is now 2, otherwise, it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
