To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for k in s:`, where `s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters.

Since `s` is a string, the loop will iterate over each character in the string. To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the next character in the string.

At the end of the previous iteration, the second character in `s` has been processed. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next character in the string.

Here's the adjusted state:

* `n` remains the same (integer equal to the first input)
* `m` remains the same (integer equal to the second input)
* `arr` remains the same (list of integers from the third input)
* `s` remains the same (non-empty string equal to the fourth input), but we need to consider the next character in the string
* `ans` remains the same (list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m)
* `_` remains the same (1)
* `p` remains the same (the last element in ans)
* `l` and `r` depend on the next character in `s`. If the next character is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is n - 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is n - 2.

Since we don't know the exact next character in `s`, we can't determine the exact values of `l` and `r`. However, we can express the state as:

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input that must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is a list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m, `_` is 1, `p` is the last element in ans, `l` and `r` depend on the next character in `s` (if 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is n - 1, otherwise `l` is 0 and `r` is n - 2)**
