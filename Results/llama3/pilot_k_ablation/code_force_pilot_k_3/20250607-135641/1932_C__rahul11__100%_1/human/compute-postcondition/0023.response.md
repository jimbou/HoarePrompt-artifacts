Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `stdin` is empty. If `strr` is 'R', then `l` is 0, `r` is `n`, and `p` is `arr[n]` modulo `m`. Otherwise, `l` is `n-2`, `r` is `n-1`, and `p` is `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`. In both cases, `_` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `strr` is a single character.***
