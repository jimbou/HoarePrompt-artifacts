Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a non-empty string with at least 1 character, _ is 1, ans is a list containing the value of p * arr[r+1] % m if strr is 'R' otherwise p * arr[l] % m, p is appended to ans, r is incremented by 1, and p is updated to p * arr[r] % m.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `r` is incremented by 1, and the value of `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. The list `ans` still contains the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and `p` is appended to `ans`.
