Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is an empty string, ans is an empty list, _ is 1, p is 1, l is 0, and r is n.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p`, `_` is 1. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `p` is updated to `p * arr[r+1] % m`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n+1`. If the last character of `s` is not 'R', then `p` is updated to `(p * arr[l-1]) % m`, `l` is -1, and `r` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and `p` is appended to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 1 character, `_` is 1. If `strr` is 'R', `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` and the updated value of `p`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `p` is updated to `p * arr[r] % m`. If `strr` is not 'R', `l` is 1 less than its original value, `p` is the value of its original value times `arr[l]` modulo `m`, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and the updated value of `p` is appended to `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
