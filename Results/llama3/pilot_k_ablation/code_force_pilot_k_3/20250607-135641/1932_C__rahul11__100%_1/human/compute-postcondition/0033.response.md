Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a non-empty string, ans is a list containing two elements which are arr[n] modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise it is arr[n-2] modulo m, and (arr[n] modulo m) * arr[r+1] modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise it is either (arr[n] modulo m) * arr[l+2] modulo m or (arr[n-2] modulo m) * arr[l+2] modulo m, l is either 0 or n-2 if strr is 'R', otherwise it is either -1 or n-3, r is either n+2 or n+1 if strr is 'R', otherwise it is either n+1 or n, p is (arr[n] modulo m) * arr[r+1] modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise it is either (arr[n] modulo m) * arr[l+2] modulo m or (arr[n-2] modulo m) * arr[l+2] modulo m, _ is 0, and strr is the second last character in the reversed string s.***
