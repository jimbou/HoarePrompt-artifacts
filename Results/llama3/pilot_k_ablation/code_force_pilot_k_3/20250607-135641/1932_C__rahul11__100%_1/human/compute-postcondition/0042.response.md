Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input, `ans` is a list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m, `l` is 1, `r` is n - 1, `_` is 1, `p` is the last element in ans, and the first character in `s`, `k`, is 'L'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `l` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `l` is now 1, while the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, `r`, `_`, `p`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state.
