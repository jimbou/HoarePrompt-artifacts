Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and `p` is appended to `ans`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `_` remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `p`. The other conditions related to `strr`, `p`, `arr`, `r`, and `l` are still valid, but `ans` has been updated to include the value of `p`.
