Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a string equal to the fourth input that must not be empty, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in s, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in s, p is the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index r modulo m if the last character of s is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr, modulo m if the last character of s is not 'R', ans is a list containing the product of the original value of p and the value of arr at index r modulo m if the last character of s is 'R', or the product of the original value of p and the element at index l in arr, modulo m if the last character of s is not 'R', strr is the second last character in s. If strr is 'R', then r is increased by 1. If strr is not 'R', then l is decreased by 1.***
