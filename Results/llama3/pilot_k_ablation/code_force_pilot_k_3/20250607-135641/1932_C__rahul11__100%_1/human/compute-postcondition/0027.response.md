Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a non-empty string, ans is a list containing one element which is arr[n] modulo m if strr is 'R', otherwise it is arr[n-2] modulo m, l is either -1 or n-3, r is either n or n-1, p is either (arr[n] modulo m) * arr[l+1] modulo m or (arr[n-2] modulo m) * arr[l+1] modulo m, _ is 0, and strr is the previous character in the reversed string s.**

The first line decrements the value of `l` by 1, changing its value from either 0 or `n-2` to either -1 or `n-3`. The second line updates the value of `p` by multiplying its current value with `arr[l]` and taking the modulus `m`. Since `l` has been decremented, `arr[l]` is now `arr[l+1]` from the initial state. Therefore, `p` becomes either `(arr[n] modulo m) * arr[l+1] modulo m` or `(arr[n-2] modulo m) * arr[l+1] modulo m`. No other variables are affected by the code.
