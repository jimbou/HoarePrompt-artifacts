To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for strr in s[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the characters of the string `s` in reverse order.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `n` is an integer equal to the first input
* `m` is an integer equal to the second input
* `arr` is a list of integers from the third input
* `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters
* `_` is 1
* `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and `p` is appended to `ans`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head. The only object in the loop head is the string `s`, which is being iterated over in reverse order.

Since we are iterating over the characters of `s` in reverse order, the next character to be processed is the one before the current character. Therefore, the state of `s` needs to be adjusted to reflect that one character has been processed.

The adjusted state is:

* `n` is an integer equal to the first input (no change)
* `m` is an integer equal to the second input (no change)
* `arr` is a list of integers from the third input (no change)
* `s` is a non-empty string with at least 1 character (since one character has been processed)
* `_` is 1 (no change)
* `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and `p` is appended to `ans` (no change)

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string with at least 1 character, `_` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p * arr[r+1] % m` if `strr` is 'R' otherwise `p * arr[l] % m`, and `p` is appended to `ans`**
