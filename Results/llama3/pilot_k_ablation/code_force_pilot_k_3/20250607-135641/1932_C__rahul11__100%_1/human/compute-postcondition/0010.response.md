Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is the second character of `s`. If the first character of `s` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` - 2. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n` - 3. In both cases, `_` is 0 and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r` has been decremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions for `l` and `r` based on the first character of `s` are still valid, but the value of `r` has been updated accordingly.
