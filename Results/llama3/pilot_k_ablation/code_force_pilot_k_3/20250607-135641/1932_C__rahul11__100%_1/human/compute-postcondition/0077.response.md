Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a string equal to the fourth input, l is 0, r is n - 1, and the values of other variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, and `s` are updated based on the inputs provided. The value of `l` is set to 0, and the value of `r` is set to `n - 1`. The values of `ans`, `_`, `p`, and the printed values of `ans` in reverse order remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
