According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `k` is the first character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `s` must have at least 2 characters and the `k` is the second character in the string `s`.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is the second character in the string `s`. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`.**
