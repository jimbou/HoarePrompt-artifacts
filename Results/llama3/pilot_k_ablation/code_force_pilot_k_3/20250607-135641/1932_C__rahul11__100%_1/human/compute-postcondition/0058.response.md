Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a non-empty string, ans is an empty list, _ is 1, p is p * arr[r+1] % m, l is 0, r is n+1, and the last character of s, strr, is 'R'.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated by multiplying it with the element at index `r+1` in the list `arr`, and then taking the modulus of the result with `m`. The value of `r` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
