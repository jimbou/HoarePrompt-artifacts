Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `arr[n]` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`, `l` is either 0 or `n-2`, `r` is either `n` or `n-1`, `p` is either `arr[n]` modulo `m` or `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`, `_` is 0, and `strr` is a single character.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` now contains one element, which is the remainder of either `arr[n]` divided by `m` (if `strr` is 'R') or `arr[n-2]` divided by `m` (otherwise). The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `p`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `strr` is still a single character.
