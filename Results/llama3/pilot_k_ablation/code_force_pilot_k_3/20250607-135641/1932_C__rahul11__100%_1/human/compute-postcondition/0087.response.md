Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is the second character in the string `s`. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is `n - 1`. If `k` is not 'L', then `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.***
