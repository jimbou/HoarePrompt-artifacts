Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a list containing the value of `p`, `_` is 1. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `p` is updated to `p * arr[r+1] % m`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n+1`. If the last character of `s` is not 'R', then `p` is updated to `(p * arr[l-1]) % m`, `l` is -1, and `r` is `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been appended to the list `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, and `_` retaining their initial values. The values of `p`, `l`, and `r` depend on the last character of the string `s`. If the last character is 'R', then `p` is updated to `p * arr[r+1] % m`, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n+1`. If the last character is not 'R', then `p` is updated to `(p * arr[l-1]) % m`, `l` is -1, and `r` is `n`.
