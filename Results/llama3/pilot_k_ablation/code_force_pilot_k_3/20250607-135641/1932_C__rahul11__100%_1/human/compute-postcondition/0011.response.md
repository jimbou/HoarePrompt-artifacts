Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is the second character of `s`. If the second character of `s` is 'L', then if the first character of `s` is 'L', `l` is 2 and `r` is `n` - 1. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` - 2. If the second character of `s` is not 'L', then if the first character of `s` is 'L', `l` is 1 and `r` is `n` - 2. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n` - 3. In all cases, `_` is 0 and `stdin` is empty.***
