Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `k` is the first character in the string `s`. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 2`.***
