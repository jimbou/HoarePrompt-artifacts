Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty string, l is 0, r is n - 1, _ is 0, p is 1, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 1 to the variable p. The second line initializes an empty list and assigns it to the variable ans. 

Since the initial state of s is an empty string, the number of 'L' characters in s is 0, so l remains 0. Similarly, the number of 'R' characters in s is also 0, so r remains n - 1. The values of n, m, arr, and _ are not affected by the code. The stdin remains empty as there are no input operations in the code.
