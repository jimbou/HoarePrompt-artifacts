The `print(*ans[::-1])` statement will print the elements of the `ans` list in reverse order.

The `ans` list contains the cumulative product of the elements in the `arr` list, modulo `m`. The cumulative product is calculated by multiplying each element in `arr` with the previous product, and taking the result modulo `m`.

Since the `ans` list contains `len(s)` elements, which is 0 (because `s` is an empty string), the `ans` list is also empty.

Therefore, when the `print(*ans[::-1])` statement is executed, it will print an empty list, because there are no elements in the `ans` list to print.

Output: **[] (an empty list)**
