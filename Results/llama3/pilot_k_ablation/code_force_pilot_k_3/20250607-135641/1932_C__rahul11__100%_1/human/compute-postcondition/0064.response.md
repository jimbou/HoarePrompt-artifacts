Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, ans is a list containing the value of p * arr[r+1] % m, _ is 1, r is r+1**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been incremented by 1. The value of `p` has been updated to be the result of multiplying the original value of `p` by the integer at index `r` in the list `arr`, then taking the modulus of the result with `m`. The list `ans` now contains this updated value of `p`. All other variables remain unchanged.
