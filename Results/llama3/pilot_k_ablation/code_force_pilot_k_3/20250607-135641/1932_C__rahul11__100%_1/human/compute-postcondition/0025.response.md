To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for strr in s[::-1]:`, which means we are iterating over the characters of the string `s` in reverse order.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `strr` is a single character. For the loop to execute again, we need to move to the next character in the reversed string `s`.

Since we are iterating in reverse order, the next character will be the one before the current character `strr` in the original string `s`.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the value of `strr`, which will be the previous character in the reversed string `s`.

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `arr`, `ans`, `l`, `r`, `p`, and `_`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `arr[n]` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`, `l` is either 0 or `n-2`, `r` is either `n` or `n-1`, `p` is either `arr[n]` modulo `m` or `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`, `_` is 0, and `strr` is the previous character in the reversed string `s`.**
