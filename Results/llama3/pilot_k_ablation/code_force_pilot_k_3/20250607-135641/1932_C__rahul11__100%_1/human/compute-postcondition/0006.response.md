The code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. In the initial state, `r` is equal to `n - 1`. Therefore, after executing the code, `r` will be equal to `n - 2`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, `_` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `k` is the first character in the string `s` and `k` is not equal to 'L'.**
