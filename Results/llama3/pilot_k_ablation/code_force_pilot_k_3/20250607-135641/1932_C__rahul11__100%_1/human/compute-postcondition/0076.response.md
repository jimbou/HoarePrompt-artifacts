To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `_`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the state of `_` needs to be adjusted to 2.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, `p`, `l`, and `r`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is an empty string, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `_` is 2, `p` is the final value of `p` after the loop finishes, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n`, and the values in the list `ans` are printed in reverse order**
