Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input, `ans` is a list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m, `l` is 0, `r` is n - 2, `_` is 1, `p` is the last element in ans, `k` is the first character in `s` and `k` is not 'L', and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `n - 2` because the code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
