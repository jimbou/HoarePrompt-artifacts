Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is an empty string, ans is an empty list, _ is 1, p is 1, l is 0, and r is n.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value 1 to the variable p, overwriting its previous value which was the last element in the list ans. The second line assigns an empty list to the variable ans, effectively clearing its previous contents which were the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m. 

The values of n, m, arr, s, _, l, and r remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The value of p is updated to 1, and the value of ans is updated to an empty list. The values of l and r are still 0 and n, respectively, since the string s remains empty.
