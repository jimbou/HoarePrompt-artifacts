Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2*10^5, 1 <= m <= 10^4). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^4). The third line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters 'L' and 'R'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = input()
    l = 0
    r = n - 1
    for k in s:
        if k == 'L':
            l += 1
        else:
            r -= 1
    p = 1
    ans = []
    for strr in s[::-1]:
        if strr == 'R':
            r += 1
            p = p * arr[r] % m
        else:
            l -= 1
            p = p * arr[l] % m
        ans.append(p)
    print(*ans[::-1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty string, ans is a list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m, l is 0, r is n - 1, _ is 0, p is the last element in ans, and stdin is empty, and the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m in reverse order is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is an empty string, `ans` is a list containing the values of `p` after each iteration of the loop, `_` is 1, `p` is the final value of `p` after the loop finishes, `l` is 0, and `r` is `n`, and the values in the list `ans` are printed in reverse order

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string equal to the fourth input, `l` is equal to 0, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the first character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the first character of `s` is not 'R`, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', and the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1 modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is not 'R', and the value of `p`, `strr` is the first character in `s`, and the elements of `ans` in reverse order are being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
