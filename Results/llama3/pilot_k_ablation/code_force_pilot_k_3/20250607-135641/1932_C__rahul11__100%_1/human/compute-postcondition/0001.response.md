Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a string, l is 0, r is n - 1, _ is 0, stdin is empty**

The code reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `m`. It then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`. The next line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `s`. The last two lines initialize `l` to 0 and `r` to `n - 1`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. After the code executes, stdin is empty because all inputs have been read.
