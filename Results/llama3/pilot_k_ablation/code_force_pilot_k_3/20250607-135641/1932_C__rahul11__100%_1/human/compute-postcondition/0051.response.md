Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input that must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is a list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m, `_` is 1, `p` is the last element in ans, `l` is either 2 or 1 and `r` is either n - 1 or n - 2 depending on the next character in `s` (if 'L', then `l` is 2 and `r` is n - 1, otherwise `l` is 1 and `r` is n - 2)**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, `_`, and `p` remain unchanged. The value of `l` is incremented by 1, so it is either 2 or 1 depending on the next character in `s`. The value of `r` remains either `n - 1` or `n - 2` depending on the next character in `s`.
