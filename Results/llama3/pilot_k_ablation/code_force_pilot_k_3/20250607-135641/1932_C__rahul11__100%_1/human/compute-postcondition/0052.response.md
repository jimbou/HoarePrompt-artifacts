Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input that must have at least 2 characters, `ans` is a list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m, `_` is 1, `p` is the last element in ans, `l` and `r` depend on the next character in `s` (if 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is n - 2, otherwise `l` is 0 and `r` is n - 3)**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `l` and `r` still depends on the next character in `s`, but the value of `r` has been updated accordingly.
