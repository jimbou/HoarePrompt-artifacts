Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `k` is the second character in the string `s`. If `k` is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is `n - 2`. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is `n - 3`.**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been decremented by 1. If `k` is 'L', then `r` is now `n - 2`, otherwise `r` is now `n - 3`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
