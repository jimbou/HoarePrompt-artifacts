Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `k` is the first character in the string `s`, `l` is 0, `r` is `n - 2`, and `k` is not equal to 'L'**

In this output state, the value of `r` has been updated to `n - 2` because the code `r -= 1` decrements the value of `r` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
