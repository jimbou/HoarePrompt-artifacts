Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string equal to the fourth input that must have at least 3 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1 if the third last character in `s` is not 'R', otherwise `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1 if the third last character in `s` is 'R', otherwise `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1 modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is 'R', otherwise `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', and the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1 modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is not 'R', `strr` is the third last character in `s`.**
