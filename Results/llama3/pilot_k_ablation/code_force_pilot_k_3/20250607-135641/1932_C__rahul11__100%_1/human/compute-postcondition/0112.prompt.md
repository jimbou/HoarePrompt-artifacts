Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, m is an integer equal to the second input, arr is a list of integers from the third input, s is a string equal to the fourth input, l is equal to the number of 'L' characters in s, r is equal to n - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in s, p is 1, ans is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string equal to the fourth input that must not be empty, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', `strr` is the last character in `s`. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. If the last character of `s` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string equal to the fourth input that must not be empty, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', and the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', `strr` is the second last character in `s`. If `strr` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1. If `strr` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string equal to the fourth input that must have at least 3 characters, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s` minus 1 if the third last character in `s` is not 'R', otherwise `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s` plus 1 if the third last character in `s` is 'R', otherwise `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1 modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is 'R', otherwise `p` is the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `l` modulo `m`, `ans` is a list containing the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the last character of `s` is not 'R', and the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` plus 1 modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is 'R', or the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m` if the third last character in `s` is not 'R', and the value of `p`, `strr` is the third last character in `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
