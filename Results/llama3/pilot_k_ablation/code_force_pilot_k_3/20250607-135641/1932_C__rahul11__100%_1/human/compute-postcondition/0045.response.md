Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a non-empty string equal to the fourth input, `ans` is a list containing len(s) elements which are the cumulative product of arr elements modulo m, `_` is 1, `p` is the last element in ans, and stdin is empty. If the first character in `s`, `k`, is 'L', then `l` is 1 and `r` is n - 1. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `r` is n - 2.***
