Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty string, l is 0, r is n - 1, _ is 0, p is 1, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for strr in s[::-1]:
    if strr == 'R':
        r += 1
        p = p * arr[r] % m
    else:
        l -= 1
        p = p * arr[l] % m
    ans.append(p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a list containing one element which is `arr[n]` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`, `l` is either 0 or `n-2`, `r` is either `n` or `n-1`, `p` is either `arr[n]` modulo `m` or `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`, `_` is 0, and `strr` is a single character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a list containing two elements which are `arr[n]` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is `arr[n-2]` modulo `m`, and (`arr[n]` modulo `m`) * `arr[r]` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either (`arr[n]` modulo `m`) * `arr[l+1]` modulo `m` or (`arr[n-2]` modulo `m`) * `arr[l+1]` modulo `m`, `l` is either 0 or `n-2` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either -1 or `n-3`, `r` is either `n+1` or `n` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either `n` or `n-1`, `p` is either (`arr[n]` modulo `m`) * `arr[r]` modulo `m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either (`arr[n]` modulo `m`) * `arr[l+1]` modulo `m` or (`arr[n-2]` modulo `m`) * `arr[l+1]` modulo `m`, `_` is 0, and `strr` is the previous character in the reversed string `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a non-empty string, `ans` is a list containing three elements which are `arr[n] modulo m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is `arr[n-2] modulo m`, and (`arr[n] modulo m`) * `arr[r+1] modulo m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either (`arr[n] modulo m`) * `arr[l+2] modulo m` or (`arr[n-2] modulo m`) * `arr[l+2] modulo m`, and (`arr[n] modulo m`) * `arr[r+1] modulo m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either (`arr[n] modulo m`) * `arr[l+2] modulo m` or (`arr[n-2] modulo m`) * `arr[l+2] modulo m`, `l` is either 0 or `n-2` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either -1 or `n-3`, `r` is either `n+2` or `n+1` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either `n+1` or `n`, `p` is (`arr[n] modulo m`) * `arr[r+1] modulo m` if `strr` is 'R', otherwise it is either (`arr[n] modulo m`) * `arr[l+2] modulo m` or (`arr[n-2] modulo m`) * `arr[l+2] modulo m`, `_` is 0, and `strr` is the second last character in the reversed string `s`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
