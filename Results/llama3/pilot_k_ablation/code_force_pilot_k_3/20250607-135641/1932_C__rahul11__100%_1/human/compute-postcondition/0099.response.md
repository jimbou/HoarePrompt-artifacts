Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `m` is an integer equal to the second input, `arr` is a list of integers from the third input, `s` is a string equal to the fourth input that must not be empty, `l` is equal to the number of 'L' characters in `s`, `r` is equal to `n` - 1 minus the number of 'R' characters in `s`, `p` is 1, `ans` is an empty list, `strr` is the last character in `s`. If the last character of `s` is 'R', then `r` is increased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the value of `arr` at index `r` modulo `m`. If the last character of `s` is not 'R', then `l` is decreased by 1 and `p` is updated to the product of the original value of `p` and the element at index `l` in `arr`, modulo `m`.***
