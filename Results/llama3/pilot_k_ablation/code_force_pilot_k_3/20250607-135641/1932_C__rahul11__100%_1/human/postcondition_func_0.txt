This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers (n and m), a list of n integers, and a string of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. For each test case, it calculates the product of the integers at specific indices in the list, determined by the 'L' and 'R' characters in the string, modulo m. The function then prints the calculated products in reverse order for each test case.
