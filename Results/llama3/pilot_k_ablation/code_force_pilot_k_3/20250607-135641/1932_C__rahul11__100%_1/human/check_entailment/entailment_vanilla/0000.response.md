Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n`, the modulus `m`, the array `arr`, and the string of commands `s`.
3. It initializes two pointers, `l` and `r`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
4. It then iterates over the string of commands `s` from left to right, moving the pointers accordingly. If the command is 'L', it increments `l`, and if the command is 'R', it decrements `r`.
5. After that, it initializes a variable `p` to 1, which will store the product of the remaining elements in the array.
6. It then iterates over the string of commands `s` in reverse order. For each command, it updates the product `p` by multiplying it with the element at the current position (either `arr[r]` or `arr[l]`) and taking the modulus `m`.
7. It appends the updated product `p` to the list `ans`.
8. Finally, it prints the list `ans` in reverse order, which represents the remainders of the product of the remaining elements in the array after each command.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
