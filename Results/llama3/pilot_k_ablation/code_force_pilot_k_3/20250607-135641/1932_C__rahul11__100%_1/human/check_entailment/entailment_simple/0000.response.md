Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the commands in the string `s` from left to right, calculates the remainder of the product of the elements in the array `a` when divided by `m`, and prints the results in the correct order.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly initializes the variables `n`, `m`, `arr`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `p`, and `ans`.
2. The program correctly calculates the initial values of `l` and `r` based on the number of 'L' and 'R' characters in the string `s`.
3. The program correctly iterates over the characters in the string `s` in reverse order using the `s[::-1]` syntax.
4. Inside the loop, the program correctly updates the values of `r` and `l` based on the current character in `s`.
5. The program correctly calculates the product `p` of the elements in the array `a` when divided by `m` using the modulo operator (`%`).
6. The program correctly appends the calculated product `p` to the list `ans`.
7. Finally, the program correctly prints the elements of `ans` in reverse order using the `*` operator.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem's requirements and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
