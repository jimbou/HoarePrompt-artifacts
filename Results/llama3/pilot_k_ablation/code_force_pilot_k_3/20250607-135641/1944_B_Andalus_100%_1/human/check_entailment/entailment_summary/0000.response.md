Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly separates the input integers into two lists (lft and rgt) and then categorizes the integers in lft into three lists: ldb (duplicates), rdb (duplicates in rgt), and sng (single occurrences). The program then prints out a sequence of integers, prioritizing duplicates from ldb and rdb, followed by single occurrences from sng, until a total of 2k integers are printed. This process is repeated for each test case.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required steps to solve the problem. It handles the edge cases correctly, such as when there are no duplicates or single occurrences in the input. The program also correctly prints the output in the required format.

Correctness: **True**
