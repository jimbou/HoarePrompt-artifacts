Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input array `a` contains duplicate elements that are not consecutive. In this case, the program's logic of checking for duplicates by comparing adjacent elements will fail.

For example, consider the input:

```
n = 4
k = 2
a = [1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

In this case, the program will not correctly identify the duplicates and will not produce the correct output.

The program assumes that the duplicates are always consecutive, which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly handle non-consecutive duplicates.
