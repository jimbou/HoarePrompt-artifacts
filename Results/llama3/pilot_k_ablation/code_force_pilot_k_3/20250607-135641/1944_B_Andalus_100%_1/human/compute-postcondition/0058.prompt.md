Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1]. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 3 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is 3. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. i is n, n is greater than or equal to 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains the element at index i in rgt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. sz is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least one element, elem is the first element in ldb, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1]. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 3 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is 3. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. i is n, n is greater than or equal to 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains the element at index i in rgt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 2 and the current value of 2k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0, and elem elem (where elem is the first element in ldb) is printed. Otherwise, sz is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in ldb, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1]. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 3 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is 3. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. i is n, n is greater than or equal to 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains the element at index i in rgt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 2 and the current value of 2k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0, and elem elem (where elem is the first element in ldb) is printed. Otherwise, sz is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and elem elem (where elem is the second element in ldb) is printed. sz is either 0 or 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in ldb, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1]. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 3 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is 3. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. i is n, n is greater than or equal to 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains the element at index i in rgt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is either 2 or 4 and the current value of 2k minus sz is greater than or equal to -2, and elem elem (where elem is the first or third element in ldb) is printed. Otherwise, sz is either 0 or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and elem elem (where elem is the second element in ldb) is printed. sz is either 0, 2 or 4.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
