Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input. The current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ldb` has been updated to contain the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the current value of `lft[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
