Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than `i`, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are the same, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the two smallest integers between 1 and n inclusive if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, `i` is either equal to `n` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input, and the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive at index `i` of `lft` is appended to `ldb`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive at index `i` of `lft` is appended to `ldb`.
