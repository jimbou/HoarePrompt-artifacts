Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, the current value of `sz` is a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k and is greater than or equal to 2 * k, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
