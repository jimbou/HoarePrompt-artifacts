Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least one element, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
