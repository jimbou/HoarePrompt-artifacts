The code prints the first element of the list `sng`, which contains all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, followed by a space.
Output: **[the first element of the list sng] (which is an integer between 1 and n inclusive that appears only once in lft) **
