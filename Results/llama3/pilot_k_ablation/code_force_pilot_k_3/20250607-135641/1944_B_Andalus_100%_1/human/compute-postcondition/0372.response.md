Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, and the third element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables retain their initial values and properties, except for `sz`, which is incremented by 1. Additionally, the third element of the list `sng`, which is stored in the variable `elem`, is printed.
