Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, stdin contains no input. If the first two elements of lft are different, then lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing the first element of lft, i is n, sz is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2) + len(sng), and elem is the first element in lft. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
