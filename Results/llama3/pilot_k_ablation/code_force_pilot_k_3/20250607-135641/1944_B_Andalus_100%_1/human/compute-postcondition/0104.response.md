To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sng` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `i` is `n` before the loop starts, we can't rely on it to ensure the loop execution. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to have at least 1 element, and `elem` will be the first element in the list.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing at least len(rdb) elements, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is n, and `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb)**
