According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to be 1, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1**
