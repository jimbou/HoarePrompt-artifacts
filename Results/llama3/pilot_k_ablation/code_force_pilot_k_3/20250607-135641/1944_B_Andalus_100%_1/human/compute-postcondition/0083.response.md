To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise `rdb` is an empty list, we need to adjust the state of `rdb` to have at least 1 element.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n, `sz` is 0, and nothing is printed.**
