The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable elem. If elem is the next element in the list sng the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, elem is the first element in sng. So for the loop to be executed one more time elem must be the second element in sng.
