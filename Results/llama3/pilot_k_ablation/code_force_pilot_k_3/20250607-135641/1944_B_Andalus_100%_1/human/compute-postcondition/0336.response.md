Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively and must have at least one element, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. The current value of `k` is such that (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0, and the first element of `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` has increased by 2, and the value of `k` is still such that (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
