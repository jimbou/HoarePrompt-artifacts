The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the last element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing at least len(rdb) elements, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is n, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), and an empty line is printed**
