The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `elem`. If `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`, `rdb` must have at least 2 elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `rdb` must have at least 3 elements and the `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`.**
