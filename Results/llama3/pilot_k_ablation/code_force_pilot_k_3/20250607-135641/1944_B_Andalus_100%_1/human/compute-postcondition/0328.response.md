Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, `elem` is the last element in `sng`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then all elements in `ldb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `sng` is empty, and the variable `sz` is a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k. The loop has iterated over all elements in `sng` and printed them, and the program has either broken out of the most internal loop or if statement or printed all elements in `ldb` twice with a space in between, depending on the value of `sz`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
