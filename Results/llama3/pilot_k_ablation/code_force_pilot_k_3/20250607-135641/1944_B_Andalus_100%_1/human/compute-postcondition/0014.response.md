The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2**
