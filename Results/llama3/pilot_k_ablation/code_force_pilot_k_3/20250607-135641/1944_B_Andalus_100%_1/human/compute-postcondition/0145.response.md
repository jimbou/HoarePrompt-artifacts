Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than `i + 1`, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are the same, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if `i + 1` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i + 1` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 2`, and also contains the element at index `i` of `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the two smallest integers between 1 and n inclusive if `i + 1` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i + 1` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 2`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), and stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ldb` now contains an additional element, which is the element at index `i` of `lft`. The value of `i` has also been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
