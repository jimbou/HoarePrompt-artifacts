To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `sng`. If `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sng` is an empty list, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 element. Also, `elem` is the last element in `sng`, so it needs to be adjusted to be the first element in `sng` for the loop to start.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb), and `elem` is the first element in `sng`.**
