Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the last element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, sz is either 0 or a multiple of 2 between 2 and 2k inclusive, and the current value of 2k minus sz is greater than or equal to -sz.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will iterate over each element in the list sng, printing each element followed by a space if the condition sz < 2 * k is met. The value of sz will increase by 1 for each iteration where the condition is met, until it reaches a value where the condition is no longer met. At this point, the loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
