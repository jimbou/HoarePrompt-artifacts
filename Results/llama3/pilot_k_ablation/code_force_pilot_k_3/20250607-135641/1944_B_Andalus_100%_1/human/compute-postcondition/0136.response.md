Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the two smallest integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`.**

The code appends the current element of `lft` at index `i` to the list `sng`. Since the first two elements of `lft` are different, `sng` already contains the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Now, it also contains the second smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the current element of `lft` at index `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
