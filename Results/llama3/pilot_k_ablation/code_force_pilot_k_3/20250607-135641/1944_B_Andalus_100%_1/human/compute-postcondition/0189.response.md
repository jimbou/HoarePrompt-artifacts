Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 1 element, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(k, len(ldb)) + 1, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs, and the first element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed**

The code increments the value of `sz` by 1. The value of `sz` was previously 2 * min(k, len(ldb)), so it is now 2 * min(k, len(ldb)) + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. If the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs, and the first element of `sng`, which is `elem`, is printed.
