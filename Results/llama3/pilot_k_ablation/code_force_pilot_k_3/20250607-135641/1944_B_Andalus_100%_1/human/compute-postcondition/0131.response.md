The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.**
