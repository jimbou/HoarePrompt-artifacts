Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of _ also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of n and k are assigned from the input and are within their respective ranges. The list lst contains 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, which are assigned from the input. The lists lft and rgt are sorted lists of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, which are assigned from the input and sorted in ascending order. The lists ldb, rdb, and sng are empty lists as they are initialized as such and not modified by the code. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one as one test case has been processed by the code.
