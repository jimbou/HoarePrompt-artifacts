The code prints the third element in the `sng` list, which contains all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements. Since `sng` is a list of unique elements from `lft`, the third element in `sng` is one of the unique integers between 1 and n inclusive that appears only once in `lft`.

Output: **the third unique integer between 1 and n inclusive that appears only once in `lft`**
