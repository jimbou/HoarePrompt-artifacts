To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list `sng` must have at least 2 elements and `elem` is the second element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(k, len(ldb)) + 1, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.**
