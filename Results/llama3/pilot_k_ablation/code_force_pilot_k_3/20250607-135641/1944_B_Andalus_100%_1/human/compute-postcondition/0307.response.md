Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, `elem` is the last element in `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then all elements in `ldb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all elements in the list `ldb` that appear consecutively in the list `lft` are printed twice with a space in between, as long as the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is met. If this condition is not met, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
