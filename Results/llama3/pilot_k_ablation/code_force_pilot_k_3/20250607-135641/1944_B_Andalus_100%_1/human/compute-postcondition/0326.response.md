Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is n, `sz` is either 3 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 2, `elem` is the third element in sng. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The third element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables maintain their initial values except for `sz`, which is incremented by 1. The value of `sz` is now either 3 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 2. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, and the third element of the list `sng` is being printed.
