Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either equal to the length of `sng` or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + (length of `sng` - 1), `elem` is the last element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. All elements of `sng` which are `elem` are printed followed by a space.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `sng` and printed each element followed by a space. The value of `sz` is either equal to the length of `sng` or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + (length of `sng` - 1), depending on whether the loop broke out of the most internal loop or if statement due to `sz` being greater than or equal to 2 * k. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
