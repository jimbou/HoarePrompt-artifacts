Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb) and is greater than or equal to 2 * k, `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program execution exits the innermost loop or if statement it was currently in.
