To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue executing. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `sng` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in `sng`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `elem` and `sng`.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least one more element beyond the current `elem`. Since `elem` is the second element, for the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements. 

The state of `elem` needs to be adjusted to be the next element in `sng`, which would be the third element in `sng` if we are to execute the loop again.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the third element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing at least len(rdb) elements, `sng` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is n, `sz` is increased by 1**
