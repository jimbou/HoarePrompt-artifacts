Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, sng is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 2 elements, rdb is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, i is n, sz is either 1 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, elem is the second element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
