Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, `sng` is a list that contains the third element of `lft`**.

In this output state, the value of `sng` has been updated to include the third element of `lft`, which is `lft[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `lft` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `sng` after the code is executed. However, we can say that `sng` now contains the third element of `lft`.
