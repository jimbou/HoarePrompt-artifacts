Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively and must have at least one element, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and 2 * k - sz is less than 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered by breaking out of the loop or conditional statement.
