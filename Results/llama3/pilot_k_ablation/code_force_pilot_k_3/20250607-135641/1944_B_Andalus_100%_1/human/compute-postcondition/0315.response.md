The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list, i is n. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 1 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, `elem` is the second element in `sng`.**
