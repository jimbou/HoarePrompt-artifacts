To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in `sng`. For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` must be the second element in `sng`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, and `sz` is 2 * len(rdb) + 1, and `elem` is the second element in `sng`.**
