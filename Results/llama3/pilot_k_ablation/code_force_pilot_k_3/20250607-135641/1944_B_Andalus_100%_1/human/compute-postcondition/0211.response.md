Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, and a new line is printed. The current value of `(2 * k - sz)` is greater than or equal to 0, and this is printed: elem (which is the first element in `rdb`) twice, separated by a space, without a new line**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state, except that the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, making it 2. The value of `(2 * k - sz)` is now greater than or equal to 0.
