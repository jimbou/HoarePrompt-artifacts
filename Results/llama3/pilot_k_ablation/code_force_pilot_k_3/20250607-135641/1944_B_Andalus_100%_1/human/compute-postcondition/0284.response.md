Output State: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is `n`, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except `i` and `rdb`. The value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and `rdb` will be a list containing all the elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
