Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is an empty list, `i` is n, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are the same, otherwise `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the two smallest integers between 1 and n inclusive if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`. `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than `i`, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are the same, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the two smallest integers between 1 and n inclusive if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, `i` is either equal to `n` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input, and the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive at index `i` of `lft` is appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise it is appended to `sng` if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than `i + 1`, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are the same, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if `i + 1` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i + 1` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 2`, and also contains the element at index `i` of `lft` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive at index `i + 1` of `lft` is appended to `ldb` if `lft[i + 1]` is equal to `lft[i]`, otherwise it is appended to `sng` if `i + 1` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i + 1` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 2`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the two smallest integers between 1 and n inclusive if `i + 1` is equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i + 1` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 2`, and `sng` now contains an additional element which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive at index `i` of `lft` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `i` is `i + 1`, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), and stdin contains no input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
