The code prints the second element in the `ldb` list twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end. The `ldb` list contains all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in the sorted list `lft`. Since `ldb` must have at least 2 elements, the second element exists and is printed twice.

Output: **[the second element in ldb], [the second element in ldb]**
