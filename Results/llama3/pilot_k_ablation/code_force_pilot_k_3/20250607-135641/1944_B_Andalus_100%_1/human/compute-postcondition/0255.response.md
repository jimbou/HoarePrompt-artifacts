To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). 

Since `n` is already stated to be an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we do need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts at the correct value.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, stdin contains no input, i is 1**
