Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the first element of `lft` if the first element of `lft` is not equal to the second element of `lft`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list, `sng` now also contains the element at index `i` in `lft`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i-1` in `lft`. The current value of `i` is either equal to `n-1` or the element at index `i` in `lft` is not equal to the element at index `i+1` in `lft`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the list `sng` now contains an additional element, which is the element at index `i` in the sorted list `lft`. This is because the code appends the element at index `i` in `lft` to the list `sng`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
