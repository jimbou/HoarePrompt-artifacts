Output State: **T is 0, _ is T, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in lft, rdb is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in lft, i is n, stdin contains no input, sz is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2) + len(sng), and elem is the last element in sng.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial number of test cases `T`, which will be 0 since all test cases have been processed. The input buffer `stdin` will be empty since all input has been consumed. The variables `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, `sng`, `i`, `sz`, and `elem` will retain their last values from the final iteration of the loop.
