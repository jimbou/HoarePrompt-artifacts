Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is `n`, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   `T` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
*   `_` remains 1.
*   `n` remains an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.
*   `k` remains an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive.
*   `lst` remains a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive.
*   `lft` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive.
*   `rgt` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive.
*   `ldb` remains a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`.
*   `rdb` becomes a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`.
*   `sng` remains a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`.
*   `i` becomes `n`, indicating that the loop has executed all iterations.
*   `sz` is the minimum of 2 \* k and 2 \* len(rdb), which depends on the values of `k` and `rdb`.
*   stdin remains empty, containing no input.
