Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
