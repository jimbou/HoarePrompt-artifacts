Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, stdin contains no input, i is 1, lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], and the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and sng is a list that contains lft[i].**

In this output state, the value of sng has been updated to include the value of lft[i], which is a specific integer between 1 and n inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged, and their values are still valid as specified in the initial state.
