Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the last element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n, `sz` is 0, and nothing is printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is 2 and the first element of rdb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, nothing is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the second element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2 and the second element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the third element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is increased by 2 and the third element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
