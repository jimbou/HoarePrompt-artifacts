Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2. If the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]` appended to its previous value.***
