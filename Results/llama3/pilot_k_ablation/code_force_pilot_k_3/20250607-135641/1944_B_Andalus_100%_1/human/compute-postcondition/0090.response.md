Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is 2 and the first element of rdb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, nothing is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
