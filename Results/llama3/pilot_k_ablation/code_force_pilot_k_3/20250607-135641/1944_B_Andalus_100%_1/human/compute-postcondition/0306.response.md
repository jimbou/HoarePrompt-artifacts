Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least three elements, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the third element in `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
