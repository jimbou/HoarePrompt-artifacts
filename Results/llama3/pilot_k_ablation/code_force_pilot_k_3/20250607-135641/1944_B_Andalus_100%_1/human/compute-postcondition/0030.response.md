Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1]. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 3 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is 3. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. i is 2, n is greater than 2, rdb contains the element at index 2 in rgt.**

The code appends the element at index i in rgt to rdb. Since i is 2, the element at index 2 in rgt is appended to rdb. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
