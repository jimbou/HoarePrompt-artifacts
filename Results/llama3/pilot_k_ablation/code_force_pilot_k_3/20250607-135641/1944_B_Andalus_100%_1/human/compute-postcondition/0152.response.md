Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[i]`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is 1, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input. The current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables retain their initial values except for `rdb`, which now contains the value of `rgt[i]`. The value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the value of `rgt[i - 1]`. The size `sz` is updated to be the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), which is now 2.
