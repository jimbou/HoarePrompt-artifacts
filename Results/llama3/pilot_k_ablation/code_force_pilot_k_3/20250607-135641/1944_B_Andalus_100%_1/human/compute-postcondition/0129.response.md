Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive but the first element has been removed, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is n, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except for `lft` which has its first element removed and `sng` which now contains the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.
