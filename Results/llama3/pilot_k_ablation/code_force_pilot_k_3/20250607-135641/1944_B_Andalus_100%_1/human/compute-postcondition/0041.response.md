Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least one element, elem is the first element in ldb, rdb is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1]. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 3 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is 3. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. i is n, n is greater than or equal to 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains the element at index i in rgt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. sz is 2. The current value of 2k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0. and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the first element in ldb)**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
