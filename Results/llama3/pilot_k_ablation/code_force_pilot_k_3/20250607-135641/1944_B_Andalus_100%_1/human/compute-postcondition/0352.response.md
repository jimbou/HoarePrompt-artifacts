Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb), and `elem` is the last element in `sng`. All elements in `rdb` are printed twice with a space in between, without a newline at the end. A blank line is printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `rdb`, printing each element twice with a space in between, without a newline at the end. The list `rdb` is now empty, and the variable `sz` has been increased by 2 for each element in `rdb`. The other variables remain unchanged.
