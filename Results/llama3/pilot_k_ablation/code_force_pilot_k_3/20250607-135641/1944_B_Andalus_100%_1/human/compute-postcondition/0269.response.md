Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 3, ldb is a list with an additional element which is the third element of lft, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated by appending the third element of lft to it. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of lft is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, but it is implied that lft is a list of integers. The third element of lft is appended to ldb. The values of T, _, n, lst, rgt, and i are not affected by the code.
