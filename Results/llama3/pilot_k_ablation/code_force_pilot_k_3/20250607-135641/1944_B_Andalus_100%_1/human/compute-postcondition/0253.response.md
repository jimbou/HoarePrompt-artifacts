Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive but its first element has been removed, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft, i is n, stdin contains no input, sz is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2) + len(sng), elem is the first element in lft.**

In natural language, the output state is: T is still a positive integer greater than 2, _ is still 2, n is still an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is still a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive but its first element has been removed, rgt is still a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is still an empty list, rdb is still an empty list, sng is now a list containing the first element of lft, i is still n, stdin still contains no input, sz is still 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2) + len(sng), and elem is now the first element in lft.
