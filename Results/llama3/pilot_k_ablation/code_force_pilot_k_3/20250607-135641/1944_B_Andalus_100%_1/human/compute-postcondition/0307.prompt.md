Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least one element, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0 or 2, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`. If 2 times `k` minus `sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 2 and the first element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0, 2 or 4, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the second element in `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least three elements, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the third element in `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
