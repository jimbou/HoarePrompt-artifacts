Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(k, len(ldb)) + min(len(sng), k), and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has printed all the elements in `sng` up to a maximum of `k` times, or until `sz` reaches 2 * `k`, whichever comes first. The value of `sz` has been updated to reflect the number of elements printed, and `elem` now holds the last element that was printed. All other variables remain unchanged.
