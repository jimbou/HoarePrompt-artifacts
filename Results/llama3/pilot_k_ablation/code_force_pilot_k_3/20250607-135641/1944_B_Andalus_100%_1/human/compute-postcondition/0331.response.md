Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the last element in `sng`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then all elements in `ldb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. A blank line is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sz` has been reset to 0. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
