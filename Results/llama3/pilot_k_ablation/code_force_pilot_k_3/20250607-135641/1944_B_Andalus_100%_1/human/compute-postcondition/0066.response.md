The only objects in the loop head are variables  elem and sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sng.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in sng. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the second element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `i` is n, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, sz is either 1 or a multiple of 2 between 2 and 2k inclusive.**
