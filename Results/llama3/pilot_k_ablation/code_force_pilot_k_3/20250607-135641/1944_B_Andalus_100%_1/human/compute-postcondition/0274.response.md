To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`). Since `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we do need to adjust the state of `i` to ensure it starts at 1, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is an empty list, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1**
