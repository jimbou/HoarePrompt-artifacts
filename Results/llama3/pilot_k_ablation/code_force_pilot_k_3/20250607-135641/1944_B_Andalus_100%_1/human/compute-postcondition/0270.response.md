Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 3, sng is a list that contains the third element of lft, stdin contains no input.**

The code appends the third element of `lft` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is 3, it means we are considering the third element of `lft`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `lft` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it is implied to be a list of integers. The output state reflects the updated value of `sng` and the unchanged values of the other variables.
