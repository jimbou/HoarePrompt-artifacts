Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is a list containing the first element of lft and the element at index i in lft if the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, and the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], i is 3. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains the current value of lft[i], and sng contains the first element of lft and the element at index i in lft if the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, and the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], i is 3. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is an empty list, and sng contains the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], i is 3 and sng contains the element at index 3 in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
