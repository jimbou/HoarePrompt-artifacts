Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 3, stdin contains no input. If i equals n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list that contains the third element of lft. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
