The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains no input. If lft[i] equals lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list with an additional element which is the third element of lft. Otherwise, if i equals n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list that contains the third element of lft. Otherwise, no changes are made, i is 3**
