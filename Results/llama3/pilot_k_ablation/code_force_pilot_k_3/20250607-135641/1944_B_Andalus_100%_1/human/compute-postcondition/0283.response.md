Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `i` is 3, stdin contains no input. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively and contains one more element which is `rgt[3]`.***
