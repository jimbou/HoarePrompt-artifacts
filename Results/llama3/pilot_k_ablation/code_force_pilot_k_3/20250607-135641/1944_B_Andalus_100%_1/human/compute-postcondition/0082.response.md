Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the last element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n, `sz` is 0, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been updated to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the ranges of `n`, `k`, and the lists `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are still valid. Additionally, the relationship between `sz` and `2k` is still satisfied, as `sz` is now 0, which is a multiple of 2 between 2 and 2k inclusive.
