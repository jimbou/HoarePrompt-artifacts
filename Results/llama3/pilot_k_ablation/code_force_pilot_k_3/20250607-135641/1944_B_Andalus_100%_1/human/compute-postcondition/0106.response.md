Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing at least len(rdb) elements, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is n, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the current value of `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb) and is greater than or equal to 2 * k.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables maintain their original values and properties.
