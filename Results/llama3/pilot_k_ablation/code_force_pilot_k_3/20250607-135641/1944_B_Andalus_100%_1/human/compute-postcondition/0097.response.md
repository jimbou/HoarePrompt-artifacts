To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue. The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `rdb`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2. Since we don't have information about `k` and `sz`, we cannot determine their values. However, we can adjust the state of `elem` and `rdb` based on the fact that the loop is executing again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. For the loop to execute again, `rdb` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in `rdb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the third element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n**
