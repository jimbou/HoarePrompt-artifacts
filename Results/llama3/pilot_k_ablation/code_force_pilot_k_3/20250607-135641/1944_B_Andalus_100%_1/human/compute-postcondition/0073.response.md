Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the third element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `i` is n, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, sz is either 2 or a multiple of 2 between 2 and 2k inclusive. The second element of the list sng is printed followed by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the second element of the list `sng` is printed followed by a space, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.
