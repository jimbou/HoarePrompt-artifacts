The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

`elem` is the second element in the list `rdb`, which contains at least 2 elements.

Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't determine its exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the second element in the list rdb)**
