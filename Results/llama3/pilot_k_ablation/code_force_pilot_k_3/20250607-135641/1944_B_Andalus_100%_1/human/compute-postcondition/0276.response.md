Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1. The current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables maintain their initial values and properties, except for `rdb`, which now contains the current value of `rgt[i]`, which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`.
