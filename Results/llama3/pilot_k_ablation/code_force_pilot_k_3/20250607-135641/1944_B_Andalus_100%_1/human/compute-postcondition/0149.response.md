Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is `n`, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `rdb`, and `sz` remain unchanged. The loop has modified the variables `ldb` and `sng` to contain the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once and only once in `lft`, respectively. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
