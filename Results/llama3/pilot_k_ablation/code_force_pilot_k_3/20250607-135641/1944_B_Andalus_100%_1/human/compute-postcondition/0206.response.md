Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 0, and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed, and a new line is printed**

The code sets the value of `sz` to 0, which was previously equal to 2 * min(k, len(ldb)) + min(len(sng), k). All other variables remain unchanged.
