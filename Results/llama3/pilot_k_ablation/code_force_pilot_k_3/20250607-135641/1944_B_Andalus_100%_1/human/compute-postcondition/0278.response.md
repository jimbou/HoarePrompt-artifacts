To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2. If the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`. Otherwise, `rdb` is an empty list.**
