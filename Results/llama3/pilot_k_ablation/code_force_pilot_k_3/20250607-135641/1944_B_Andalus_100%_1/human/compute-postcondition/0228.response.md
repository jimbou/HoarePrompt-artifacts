According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sng`. If `sng` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2), and `elem` is the last element in `rdb` that was printed, and a new line is printed. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2), `elem` is the first element in `sng`, and a new line is printed.**
