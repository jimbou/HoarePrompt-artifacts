Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 5 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2) + 3, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, a new line is printed, and the third element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
