The code prints the first element of the list `sng`, which contains all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`. Since `sng` must have at least 1 element, the print statement will output the value of the first element in `sng`.

Output: **the first element in the list sng (which is an integer between 1 and n inclusive that appears only once in lft)**
