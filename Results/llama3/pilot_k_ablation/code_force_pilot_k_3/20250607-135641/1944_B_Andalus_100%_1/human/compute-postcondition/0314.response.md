Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 1 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The first element in `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, and the first element in `sng` has been printed followed by a space. The other variables remain unchanged. The program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, but this is not guaranteed.
