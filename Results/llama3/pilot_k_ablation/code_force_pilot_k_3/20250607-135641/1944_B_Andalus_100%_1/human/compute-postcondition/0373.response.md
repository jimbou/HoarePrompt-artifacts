Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb) + len(sng), and `elem` is the last element in `sng`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `sng`, printing each element and incrementing the size `sz` by 1 for each element. The loop has terminated when `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, or when all elements in `sng` have been printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
