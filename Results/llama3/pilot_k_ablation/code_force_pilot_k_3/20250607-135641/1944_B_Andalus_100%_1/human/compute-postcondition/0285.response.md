Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the variables in the precondition remain unchanged except for `i` and `rdb`. The variable `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `rdb` is now a list containing all the elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively.
