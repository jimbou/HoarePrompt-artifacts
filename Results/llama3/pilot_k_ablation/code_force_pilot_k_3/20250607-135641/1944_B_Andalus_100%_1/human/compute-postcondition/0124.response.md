Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the last element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing at least len(rdb) elements, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is n, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb).

The loop will execute until `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k` or until all elements in `sng` have been processed. After the loop finishes executing, `sng` will be an empty list because all its elements will have been printed, and `sz` will be the minimum of 2 times `k` and 2 times the length of `rdb`. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop head and body.
