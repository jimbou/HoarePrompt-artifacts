Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is n, `sz` is either 2 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, `elem` is the third element in sng, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
