Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb), and `elem` is the last element in `sng`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then all elements in `rdb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. A blank line is printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, and `sz` is 2 * len(rdb) + 1, and `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb) + 2, and `elem` is the second element in `sng`. The second element in `sng` which is `elem` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, `elem` is the third element in `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, and the third element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
