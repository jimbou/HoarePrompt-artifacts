Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(k, len(ldb)), `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has printed all the elements in `ldb` that it could, given the constraint that `2 * k - sz >= 2`. The value of `sz` is now equal to twice the minimum of `k` and the length of `ldb`, indicating that the loop has printed as many pairs of elements as possible. The value of `elem` is the last element in `ldb` that was printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
