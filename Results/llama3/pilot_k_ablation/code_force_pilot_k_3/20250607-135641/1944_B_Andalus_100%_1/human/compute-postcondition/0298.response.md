Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 2 or 4, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`, and the second element in `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2. It is now either 2 or 4. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
