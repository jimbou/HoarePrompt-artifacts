The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing the value of `rgt[i]` if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, otherwise it is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is 2, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.**
