Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is increased by 2, and a new line is printed, and this is printed: the third element in `rdb` which is `elem` and `elem` again, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
