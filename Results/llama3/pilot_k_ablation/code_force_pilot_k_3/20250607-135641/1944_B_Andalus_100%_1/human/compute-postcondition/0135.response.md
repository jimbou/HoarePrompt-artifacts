Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and greater than 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of `lft` are different, otherwise `sng` is an empty list. The first two elements of `lft` are different. The current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`.**
