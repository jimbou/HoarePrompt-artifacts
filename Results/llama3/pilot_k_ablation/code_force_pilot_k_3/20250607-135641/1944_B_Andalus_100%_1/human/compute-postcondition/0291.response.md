Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least one element, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, stdin contains no input. The current value of `k` is such that 2 times `k` minus `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and the first element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, so it is now 2. The value of `k` is still such that 2 times `k` minus `sz` is greater than or equal to 0, because `sz` is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
