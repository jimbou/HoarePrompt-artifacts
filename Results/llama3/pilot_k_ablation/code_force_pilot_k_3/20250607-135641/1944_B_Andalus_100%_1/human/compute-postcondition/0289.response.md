The code prints the first element in the list `ldb` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end. The first element in `ldb` is the first element in the list `lft` that appears consecutively and must have at least one element.
Output: **the first element in the list ldb, the first element in the list ldb (where the first element in the list ldb is the first element in the list lft that appears consecutively and must have at least one element)**
