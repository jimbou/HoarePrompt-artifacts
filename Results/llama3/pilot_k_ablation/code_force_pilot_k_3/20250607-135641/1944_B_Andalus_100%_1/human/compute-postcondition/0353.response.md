Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb), and `elem` is the last element in `sng`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then all elements in `rdb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. A blank line is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in `rdb`, printing each element twice with a space in between, until either all elements have been printed or the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is no longer met. The value of `sz` has been incremented by 2 for each element printed, and the value of `elem` remains the last element in the empty list `sng`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
