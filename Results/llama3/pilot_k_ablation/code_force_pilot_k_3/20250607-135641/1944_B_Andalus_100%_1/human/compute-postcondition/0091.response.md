The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list rdb.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in rdb. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
