Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `i` is 2, `ldb` is a list with an additional element which is the third element of `lft` (since `i` is 2 and list indices start at 0), stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `ldb` has been updated by appending the third element of `lft` (since `i` is 2 and list indices start at 0). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
