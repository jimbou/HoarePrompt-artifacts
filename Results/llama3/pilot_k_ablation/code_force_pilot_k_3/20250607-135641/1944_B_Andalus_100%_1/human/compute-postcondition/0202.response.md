Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is an empty list, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(k, len(ldb)) + len(sng), and `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all elements in the list `sng` have been printed, and the loop has terminated. The value of `sz` has been updated to reflect the total number of elements printed, which is the minimum of 2 times the value of `k` and the length of `ldb`, plus the length of `sng`. The value of `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed. All other variables remain unchanged.
