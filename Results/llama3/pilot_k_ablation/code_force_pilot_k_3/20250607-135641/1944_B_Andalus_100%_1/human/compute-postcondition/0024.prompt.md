Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list. If the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, then sng is a list containing the first element of lft. Otherwise, sng remains an empty list. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1]. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is a list containing the first element of lft and the element at index i in lft if the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, and the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], i is 3. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains the current value of lft[i], and sng contains the first element of lft and the element at index i in lft if the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, and the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], i is 3. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is an empty list, and sng contains the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is an empty list. If the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, then sng also contains the element at index i in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is true, then sng also contains the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], i is 3 and sng contains the element at index 3 in lft. If the condition i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1] is false, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
