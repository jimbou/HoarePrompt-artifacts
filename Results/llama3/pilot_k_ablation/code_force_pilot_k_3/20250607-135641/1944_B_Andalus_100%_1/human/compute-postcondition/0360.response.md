Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, and `sz` is 2 * len(rdb) + 1, and `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `sz` being equal to 2 * len(rdb) + 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still dependent on the value of `sz` being greater than or equal to 2 * k, and if this condition is met, the first element of `sng`, which is `elem`, is printed.
