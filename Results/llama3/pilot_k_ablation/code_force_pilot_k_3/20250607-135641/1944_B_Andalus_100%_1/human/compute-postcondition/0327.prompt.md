Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, `elem` is the last element in `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then all elements in `ldb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 1 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, `elem` is the first element in `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The first element in `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, sng is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 2 elements, rdb is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, i is n, sz is either 2 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, elem is the second element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of sng which is elem is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is n, `sz` is either 3 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 2, `elem` is the third element in sng. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken. The third element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
