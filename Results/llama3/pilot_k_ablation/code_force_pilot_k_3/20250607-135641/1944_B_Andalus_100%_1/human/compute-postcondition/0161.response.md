Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 0, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `sz` has been updated to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
