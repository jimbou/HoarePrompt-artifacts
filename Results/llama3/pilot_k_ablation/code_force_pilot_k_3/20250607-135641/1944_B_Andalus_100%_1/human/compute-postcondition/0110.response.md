Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing at least len(rdb) elements, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is n, `sz` is increased by 1. If the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb) is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the first element of sng which is elem is printed followed by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb) being greater than or equal to 2 * k still applies, and if true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If not, the first element of `sng`, which is `elem`, is printed followed by a space.
