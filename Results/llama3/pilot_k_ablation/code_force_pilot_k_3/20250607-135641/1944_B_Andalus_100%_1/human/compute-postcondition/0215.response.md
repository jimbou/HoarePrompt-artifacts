To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `rdb`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `rdb` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `rdb` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in `rdb`. For the loop to execute again, `rdb` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` must be the second element in `rdb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and a new line is printed.**
