Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `sz` is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2) + min(len(sng), k - sz // 2), `elem` is the last element in `sng` that was printed, and a new line is printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the last element of `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space.

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, printing the elements of the `sng` list until `sz` reaches 2 * k or the end of the list is reached. The value of `sz` is updated to reflect the total number of elements printed, and the last element printed is stored in `elem`. The program then breaks out of the loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k.
