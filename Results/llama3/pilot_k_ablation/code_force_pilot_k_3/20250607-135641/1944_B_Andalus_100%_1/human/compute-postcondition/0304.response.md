Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least three elements, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 2, 4 or 6, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`, and the third element in `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been updated to either 2, 4 or 6 by adding 2 to its previous value, which was either 0, 2 or 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
