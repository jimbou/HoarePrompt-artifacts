Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively and must have at least 2 elements, `i` is `n`, `sz` is increased by 2, and the second element in the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, with a space in between, without a newline at the end**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that the variable `sz` has been increased by 2. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
