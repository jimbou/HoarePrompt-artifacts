To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The only object in the loop head is the variable `elem` and the list `ldb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ldb`. If the list has at least two elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least one element, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `ldb` must have at least two elements, and `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively and must have at least two elements, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0 or 2, `elem` is the second element in `ldb`.**
