To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` should be the third element in `sng`.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 2 * len(rdb) + 2, and `elem` is the third element in `sng`.**
