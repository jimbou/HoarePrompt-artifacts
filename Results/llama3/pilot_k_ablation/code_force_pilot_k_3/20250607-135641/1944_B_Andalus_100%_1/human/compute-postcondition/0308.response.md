According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sng`. If `sng` has at least 1 element the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, `elem` is the last element in `ldb`. So for the loop to be executed  the list `sng` must have at least 1 element and the `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 1 element, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 0 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, `elem` is the first element in `sng`**
