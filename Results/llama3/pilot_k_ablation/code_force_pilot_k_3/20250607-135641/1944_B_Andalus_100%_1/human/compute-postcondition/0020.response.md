Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i], rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft if the first element of lft is not equal to the second element of lft, otherwise sng is a list containing the first element of lft and the element at index i in lft if the current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the element at index i in lft is not equal to the element at index i+1 in lft, and the element at index 2 in lft if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], i is 3**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that ldb now contains the current value of lft[i] because lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1] is not specified in the initial state, so ldb now contains the current value of lft[i].
