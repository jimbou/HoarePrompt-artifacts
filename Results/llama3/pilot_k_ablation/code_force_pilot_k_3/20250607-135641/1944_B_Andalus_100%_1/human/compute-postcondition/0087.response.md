Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n, `sz` is 2, and the first element of rdb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between.**

The value of `sz` is incremented by 2, resulting in `sz` being 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2 is still valid, but now 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k - 2.
