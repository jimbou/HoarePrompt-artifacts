Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is 3, `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), `rdb` contains the value of `rgt[2]` and `rgt[i]` which is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `rdb` has been updated to include the value of `rgt[i]`, which is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]` because of the condition in the initial state.
