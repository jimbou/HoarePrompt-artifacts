Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains no input, i is 1. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing the value of lft[i] and rdb is an empty list. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, and if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list that contains lft[i].**
