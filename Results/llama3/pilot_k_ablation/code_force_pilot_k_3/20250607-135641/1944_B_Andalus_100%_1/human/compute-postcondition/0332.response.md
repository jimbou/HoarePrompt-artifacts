To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. The loop will execute if `rdb` has at least one element. Since `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in `rgt` that appear consecutively, we need to adjust the state of `rgt` to ensure it has at least one consecutive element.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively and must have at least one element, `i` is `n`, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`**
