Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `rgt`, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft`, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `elem` is the third element in `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the third element in `ldb` is printed twice with a space in between, and `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
