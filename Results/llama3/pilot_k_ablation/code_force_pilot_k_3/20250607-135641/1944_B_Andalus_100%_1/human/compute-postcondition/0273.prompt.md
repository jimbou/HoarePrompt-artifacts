Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, stdin contains no input. If the first two elements of lft are different, then lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing the first element of lft, i is n, sz is 2 * min(len(rdb), k - sz // 2) + len(sng), and elem is the first element in lft. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains no input, i is 1. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing the value of lft[i] and rdb is an empty list. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, and if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list that contains lft[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 2, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains no input. If lft[i] equals lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list with an additional element which is the third element of lft. Otherwise, if i equals n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list that contains the third element of lft. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer greater than 3, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, i is 3, stdin contains no input. If lft[i] equals lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list with an additional element which is the third element of lft. Otherwise, if i equals n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng is a list that contains the third element of lft. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
