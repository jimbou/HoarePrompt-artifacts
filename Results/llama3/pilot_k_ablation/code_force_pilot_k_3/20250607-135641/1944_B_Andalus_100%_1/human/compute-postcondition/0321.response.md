To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `elem` and the list `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If `sng` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in the list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 3 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is n, `sz` is either 2 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, `elem` is the third element in sng**
