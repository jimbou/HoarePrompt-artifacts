Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once that must have at least 2 elements, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is either 1 or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k + 1, `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
