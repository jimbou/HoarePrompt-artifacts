Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least one consecutive element, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement that the break statement is directly inside.
