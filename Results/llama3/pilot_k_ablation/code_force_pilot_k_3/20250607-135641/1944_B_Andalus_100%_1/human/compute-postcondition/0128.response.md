Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, i is n, sz is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb), stdin contains no input.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet has modified the initial state in the following ways:

*   `n` and `k` have been assigned new values from the input, which are integers between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, respectively.
*   `lst` has been assigned a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive from the input.
*   `lft` and `rgt` have been assigned sorted lists of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, which are the first and second halves of `lst`, respectively.
*   `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` have been reset to empty lists.
*   `i` has been assigned the value of `n`.
*   `sz` has been assigned the minimum of 2 \* `k` and 2 \* `len(rdb)`, which is 0 since `rdb` is an empty list.
*   Stdin is now empty since all inputs have been consumed.

The remaining variables, `T` and `_`, retain their initial values.
