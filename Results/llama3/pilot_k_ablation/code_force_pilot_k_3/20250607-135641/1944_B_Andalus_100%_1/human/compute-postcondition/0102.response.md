Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the third element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is increased by 2 and the third element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
