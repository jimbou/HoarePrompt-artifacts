Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the last element in rdb, `rdb` is a list containing at least len(rdb) elements, `sng` is a list containing at least len(sng) elements, `i` is n, and `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * len(rdb).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop iterates over the elements in `rdb`, and for each element, it checks if the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is true. If it is, it prints the element twice with a space in between and increments `sz` by 2. If the condition is not true, it breaks out of the loop. Therefore, the final value of `sz` is the minimum of `2 * k` and `2 * len(rdb)`, which represents the total number of elements printed by the loop.
