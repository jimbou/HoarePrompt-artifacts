Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 2, _ is 2, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, sng is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear only once, rdb is an empty list, stdin contains no input, i is 0.**

The loop iterates over the list `lft` from the second element to the end. If an element is the same as the previous one, it is appended to the list `ldb`. If an element is different from the previous one and it is the last element or different from the next one, it is appended to the list `sng`. After the loop finishes, `ldb` contains all the elements in `lft` that appear consecutively, `sng` contains all the elements in `lft` that appear only once, and `rdb` remains an empty list. The variable `i` is reset to 0 after the loop finishes.
