Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear more than once in `lft`, `rdb` is a sorted list of integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing all the integers between 1 and n inclusive that appear only once in `lft` and must have at least 3 elements, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains no input, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and a new line is printed. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then the second element in `rdb` which is [elem] and the second element in `rdb` which is [elem] followed by a space is printed and `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
