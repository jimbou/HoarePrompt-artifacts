Output: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the elements in lft that appear consecutively, `sng` is an empty list, `rdb` is a list containing all the elements in rgt that appear consecutively, `i` is `n`, `sz` is a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, `elem` is the last element in `sng`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then all elements in `ldb` are printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. A blank line is printed.**
