Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least len(ldb) elements, `elem` is the first element in sng, `rdb` is a list containing the current value of rgt[i] if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], otherwise rdb is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing at least 1 element, `i` is n, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains the element at index i in rgt. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. `sz` is a multiple of 2 between 2 and 2k inclusive, and the current value of 2k minus sz is greater than or equal to -sz, and elem elem (where elem is an element in ldb) is printed for each iteration of the loop. Additionally, the current value of sz is greater than or equal to 2k.**
