Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the third character in the list. If `thorn` is 2, `thorn` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` is increased by 1.***
