Output State: **`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the third character in the list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which does not change the values of any variables. However, it does exit the innermost loop or if statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
