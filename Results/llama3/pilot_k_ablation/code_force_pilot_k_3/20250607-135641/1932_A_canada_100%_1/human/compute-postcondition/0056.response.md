Postcondition: **`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 2. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 0 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2 or 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is either 0 or 1 and `thorn` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is not '@', then `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is either 0 or 1.**
