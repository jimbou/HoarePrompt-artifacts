Postcondition: ***`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list, `ret` is either 1 or 2 or not set. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged and `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0 and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.***
