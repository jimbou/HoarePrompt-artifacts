Output State: **`len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, the first character in the list `i` is '*', and `i` is not equal to '@' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The break statement does not affect the values of `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, `stdin`, and `i`. The first character in the list `i` is still '*', and `i` is still not equal to '@'. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case.
