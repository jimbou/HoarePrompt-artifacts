Output State: **`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, the first character `i` in the list `s` is '*', `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The length `len` is still between 1 and 1000, the list `s` still has at least one character and its first character is still '*', the return value `ret` is still 0, the variable `thorn` is still 2, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, which is t-1.
