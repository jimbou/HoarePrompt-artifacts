Output State: **`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list, `ret` is either 1 or 2 or not set, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `i`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
