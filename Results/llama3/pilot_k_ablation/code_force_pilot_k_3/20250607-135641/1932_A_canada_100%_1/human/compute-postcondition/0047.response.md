Postcondition: ***`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the first character in the list, `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*', `thorn` is 0.***
