The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and `stdin`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `stdin`. If `stdin` contains at least 1 test case the loop executes again for the next test case. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, the number of '@' characters in the input which is `ret` is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `stdin` must contain at least 1 test case and the `_` is not important here because it is a throwaway variable.
State: **`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in the input, `thorn` is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case**
