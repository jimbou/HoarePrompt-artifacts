Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

* `ret` is an integer, but its exact value is not specified in the precondition.
* The print statement simply prints the value of `ret`.

Therefore, the output of the print statement will be the value of `ret`, which is an integer.

Output: **the value of ret (an integer)**
