Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is t (1 <= t <= 1000), s is a list of characters representing the input string, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character. If the first character `i` in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the first character `i` in the list `s` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues with the next test case. If the first character `i` in the list `s` is neither '@' nor '*', then the program continues with the next test case. In all cases, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 2 if it was 1, or it remains not set, `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is '*', `ret` is either 1 or not set, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3, and if `thorn` is 2, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is either 1 or not set, `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 2 or 3, `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged and `stdin` contains t-2 test cases. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is either 1 or 2 or not set, `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
