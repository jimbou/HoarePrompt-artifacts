Output State: **`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@', then `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
