Output State: **`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list, `ret` is either 1 or 2 or not set, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and `stdin` contains t-2 test cases**

The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, so it now contains t-2 test cases.
