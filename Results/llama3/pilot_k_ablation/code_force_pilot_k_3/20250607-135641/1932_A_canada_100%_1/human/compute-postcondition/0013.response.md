Postcondition: ***`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list `s`, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If the first character `i` in the list `s` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, the program continues with the next test case. If the first character `i` in the list `s` is not '*', then the program continues with the next test case.***
