Postcondition: **`len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 1, 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '@' or '*', then `ret` is 0 or 1, and `thorn` is 0.**
