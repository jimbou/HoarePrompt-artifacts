Postcondition: ***`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the first character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not '@', then `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
