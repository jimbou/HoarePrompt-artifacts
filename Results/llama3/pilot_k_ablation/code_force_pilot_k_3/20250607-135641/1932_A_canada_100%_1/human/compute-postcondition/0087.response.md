Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 0 or 1, `thorn` is 1, 2 or 3, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `i` is the second character in the list. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
