Output State: **len is the integer value of the input, s is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 1 character, ret is 0, thorn is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case, i is the first character in the list, i is not equal to '@', and the current value of i is '*'.**

In this output state, the value of thorn has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the input, the list of characters, the return value, the standard input, the first character in the list, and the current value of i all retain their initial values.
