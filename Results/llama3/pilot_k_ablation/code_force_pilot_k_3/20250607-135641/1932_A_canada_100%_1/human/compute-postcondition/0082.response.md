Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0 or 1, `thorn` is 0, 1 or 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `i` is the first character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` is set to 1. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` remains 0. If `i` is not '@', then `ret` is 0.***
