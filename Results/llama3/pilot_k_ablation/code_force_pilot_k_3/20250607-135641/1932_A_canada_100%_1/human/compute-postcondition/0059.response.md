Output State: **`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the third character in the list**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 1, 2, 3, or 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the input, the list of characters, the value of `ret`, the test cases in stdin, and the third character in the list all remain the same.
