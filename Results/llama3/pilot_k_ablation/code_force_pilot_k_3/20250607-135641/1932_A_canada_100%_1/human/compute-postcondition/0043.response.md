Output State: **`len` is the integer value of the input, `s` is a list of characters from the input that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `i` is the first character in the list, the current value of `i` is '*', and `i` is not equal to '@', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, because the `break` statement does not change any variable values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
