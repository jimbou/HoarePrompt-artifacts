Output State: **len is t (1 <= t <= 1000), s is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, i is '@', ret is 1, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line resets the value of `thorn` to 0, and the second line increments the value of `ret` by 1. 

The initial state of `thorn` is 0, so the first line does not change its value. The initial state of `ret` is 0, so the second line changes its value to 1. 

The values of `len`, `s`, `i`, and `stdin` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain the same as in the initial state. 

Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
