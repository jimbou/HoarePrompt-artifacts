Postcondition: ***`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, the first character `i` in the list `s` is '*', `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the next test case.***
