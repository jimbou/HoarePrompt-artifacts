Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `i` is the first character in the list and `i` is not equal to '@'. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `thorn` is set to 1. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` remains 0.***
