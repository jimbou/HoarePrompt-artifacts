Postcondition: ***`len` is t (1 <= t <= 1000), `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters. If `i` is '@', `ret` is 2 if it was 1, or it remains not set, `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is '*', `ret` is either 1 or not set, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3, and if `thorn` is 2, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains t-1 test cases. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is either 1 or not set, `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-1 test cases.***
