Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in the case where there are two or more consecutive thorns. According to the problem description, if you move to a cell with a coin, you pick it up. However, in the program, if there are two or more consecutive thorns, it breaks the loop and does not continue to check for coins after the thorns.

For example, if the input is:

5
.@@*@*

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 3, because you can move two cells to the right from the first cell, pick up the coin, and then move one cell to the right to pick up the second coin.

The program should continue to check for coins after the thorns, not break the loop.
