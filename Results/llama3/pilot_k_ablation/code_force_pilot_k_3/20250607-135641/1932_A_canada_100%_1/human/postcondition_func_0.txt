The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer length and a string of characters. It then processes each string, counting the number of '@' characters that are not preceded by two '*' characters. The count is printed for each test case. The function does not modify the input strings or lengths, and it does not retain any information between test cases. After processing all test cases, the function terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
