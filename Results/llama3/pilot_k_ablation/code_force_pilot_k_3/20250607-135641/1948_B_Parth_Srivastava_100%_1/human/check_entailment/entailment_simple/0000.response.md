Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the array sorted in non-decreasing order using the given operation. 

The program iterates through each element in the array. If the element is greater than 10, it checks if the first digit is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c`. If it is, and the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit, it appends both digits to `c`. Otherwise, it appends the original element to `c`. If the element is not greater than 10, it simply appends the element to `c`. 

After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If they are equal, it means the array can be sorted using the given operation, so it appends 1 to the list `b`. Otherwise, it appends 0 to `b`. 

Finally, it prints 'YES' if the corresponding element in `b` is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
