Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if the input is:

3
4
12 3 45 67

The program will output "YES", but it should output "NO" because the array [1, 2, 3, 45, 67] is not sorted in non-decreasing order.

The issue is that the program only checks if the digits of a number can be split in a way that maintains the sorted order, but it does not consider the case where the number itself is not sorted. In this case, the number 45 is not sorted, and splitting its digits does not help.

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the number itself is sorted before splitting its digits. If the number is not sorted, the program should output "NO".
