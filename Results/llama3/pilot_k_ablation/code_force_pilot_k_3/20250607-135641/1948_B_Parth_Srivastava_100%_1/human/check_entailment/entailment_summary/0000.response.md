Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. The program iterates through the input array, splits each integer greater than 10 into its first and last digits, and checks if the first digit is greater than or equal to the last element in the processed list. If it is, the program appends the first and last digits to the processed list; otherwise, it appends the original integer. After processing all test cases, the program checks if the processed list is sorted in ascending order and appends 1 to the result list if it is, or 0 otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array contains only one element or when the input array is already sorted. The program also correctly handles the case when the input array contains integers greater than 10 that need to be split into their first and last digits.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected. It processes each test case correctly, splits the integers greater than 10 into their first and last digits, and checks if the processed list is sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, the given program, and the execution summary, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
