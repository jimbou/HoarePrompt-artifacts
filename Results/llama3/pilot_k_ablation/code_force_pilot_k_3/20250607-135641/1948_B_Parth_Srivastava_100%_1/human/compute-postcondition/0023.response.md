Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is either 0 or the last digit of the first element of a, y is either 0 or the first digit of the first element of a, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list containing either the first element of a, or the first and last digits of the first element of a, i is 0. If the index i is 0 and the first element of a is larger than 10, then x is the last digit of the first element of a, y is the first digit of the first element of a, and n is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, and c contains the first element of a.***
