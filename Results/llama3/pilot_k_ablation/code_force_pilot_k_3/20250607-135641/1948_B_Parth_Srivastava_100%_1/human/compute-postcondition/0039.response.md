State: **k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, x is either 0 or the last digit of an element in a, y is either 0 or the first digit of an element in a, n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and the element in a at index i, i is greater than 1. If an element in a is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of that element, y is the first digit of that element. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in c, then if y is less than or equal to x, the last two elements of c are y and x respectively. Otherwise, the first digit of the element in a at index i is greater than or equal to the last element in c, the first digit of the element in a at index i is strictly less than the last digit of the element in a at index i. If y is less than the last element in c, then c is a list containing the element in a at index i. If the index i is 0 and the first element of a is larger than 10, then x is the last digit of the first element of a, y is the first digit of the first element of a, and n is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, x is 0, y is 0, n is either 2 or 3, and c contains the first element of a. stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
