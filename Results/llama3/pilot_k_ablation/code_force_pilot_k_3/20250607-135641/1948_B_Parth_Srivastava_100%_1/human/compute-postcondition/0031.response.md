Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, i is greater than 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If y is greater than or equal to c[n - 1], then if y is less than or equal to x, n is either 3 or 4, and c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and the first and last digits of an element in a. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3, and c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and the element at index i of a. If y is less than c[n - 1], then n is either 2 or 3, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and an additional element from a at index i.***
