Output State: **k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, n is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and the element in a at index i, and the element in a at index i, i is greater than 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this final state, the value of `k` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The list `a` also remains the same, with at least 3 elements. The values of `x` and `y` are still the last and first digits of the element in `a` at index `i`, respectively. The value of `n` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2, 3, 4, or 5. The list `c` has been appended with the element in `a` at index `i`, in addition to its previous contents. The value of `i` is still greater than 1. Finally, the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1, leaving t-4 test cases.
