Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is either 0 or the last digit of an element in a, y is either 0 or the first digit of an element in a, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, i is either 0 or greater than 0. If an element in a is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of that element, y is the first digit of that element, and n is either 1 or 2. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in c, then if y is less than or equal to x, the last two elements of c are y and x respectively, and n is 2. Otherwise, the first digit of the element in a at index i is greater than or equal to the last element in c, the first digit of the element in a at index i is strictly less than the last digit of the element in a at index i, and n is 1. If y is less than the last element in c, then c is a list containing the element in a at index i, and n is 1. If the index i is 0 and the first element of a is larger than 10, then x is the last digit of the first element of a, y is the first digit of the first element of a, and n is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, and c contains the first element of a.***
