Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, n is 0, c is a list with at least one element, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is the index of an element in a that is greater than 10, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The first digit of the element in a at index i is greater than or equal to the last element in c. The first digit of the element in a at index i is strictly less than the last digit of the element in a at index i.***
