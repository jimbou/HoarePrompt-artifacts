Output State: **k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, n is either 2, 3, 4 or 5, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and the element in a at index i, i is greater than 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this final state, the value of `n` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 2, 3, 4, or 5. The list `c` has been appended with the element from list `a` at index `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.
