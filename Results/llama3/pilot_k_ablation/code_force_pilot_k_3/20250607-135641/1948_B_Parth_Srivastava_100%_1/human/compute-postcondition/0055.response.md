Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least len(a) elements, `x` is either 0 or the last digit of an element in `a`, `y` is either 0 or the first digit of an element in `a`, `n` is either len(a), len(a)+1, len(a)+2, ..., or 2*len(a), `c` is a list containing either an element of `a`, or the first and last digits of an element in `a`, and the element in `a` at index `i`, `i` is equal to len(a)-1, `d` is a sorted list of elements in `c`. If an element in `a` is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, then the current value of `x` is the last digit of that element, the current value of `y` is the first digit of that element. If `y` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, the last two elements of `c` are `y` and `x` respectively. Otherwise, the first digit of the element in `a` at index `i` is greater than or equal to the last element in `c`, the first digit of the element in `a` at index `i` is strictly less than the last digit of the element in `a` at index `i`. If `y` is less than the last element in `c`, then `c` is a list containing the element in `a` at index `i`. If the index `i` is 0 and the first element of `a` is larger than 10, then the current value of `x` is the last digit of the first element of `a`, the current value of `y` is the first digit of the first element of `a`, and `n` is either len(a), len(a)+1, len(a)+2, ..., or 2*len(a). Otherwise, if the index `i` is 0 and the first element of `a` is not larger than 10, then the current value of `x` is 0, the current value of `y` is 0, `n` is either len(a), len(a)+1, len(a)+2, ..., or 2*len(a)-1, and `c` contains the first element of `a`. stdin contains 0 test cases. The current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `d`***
