Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers, x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, c is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains t-1 test cases, k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is either 0 or the last digit of an element in a, y is either 0 or the first digit of an element in a, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, i is either 0 or greater than 0. If an element in a is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of that element, y is the first digit of that element, and n is either 1 or 2. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in c, then if y is less than or equal to x, the last two elements of c are y and x respectively, and n is 2. Otherwise, the first digit of the element in a at index i is greater than or equal to the last element in c, the first digit of the element in a at index i is strictly less than the last digit of the element in a at index i, and n is 1. If y is less than the last element in c, then c is a list containing the element in a at index i, and n is 1. If the index i is 0 and the first element of a is larger than 10, then x is the last digit of the first element of a, y is the first digit of the first element of a, and n is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, x is 0, y is 0, n is 1, and c contains the first element of a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, x is either 0 or the last digit of an element in a, y is either 0 or the first digit of an element in a, n is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and the element in a at index i, i is greater than 0. If an element in a is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of that element, y is the first digit of that element. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in c, then if y is less than or equal to x, the last two elements of c are y and x respectively. Otherwise, the first digit of the element in a at index i is greater than or equal to the last element in c, the first digit of the element in a at index i is strictly less than the last digit of the element in a at index i. If y is less than the last element in c, then c is a list containing the element in a at index i. If the index i is 0 and the first element of a is larger than 10, then x is the last digit of the first element of a, y is the first digit of the first element of a, and n is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, x is 0, y is 0, n is either 2 or 3, and c contains the first element of a. stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, x is either 0 or the last digit of an element in a, y is either 0 or the first digit of an element in a, n is either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, and the element in a at index i, i is greater than 1. If an element in a is greater than 10 and its index is greater than 0, then x is the last digit of that element, y is the first digit of that element. If y is greater than or equal to the last element in c, then if y is less than or equal to x, the last two elements of c are y and x respectively. Otherwise, the first digit of the element in a at index i is greater than or equal to the last element in c, the first digit of the element in a at index i is strictly less than the last digit of the element in a at index i. If y is less than the last element in c, then c is a list containing the element in a at index i. If the index i is 0 and the first element of a is larger than 10, then x is the last digit of the first element of a, y is the first digit of the first element of a, and n is either 3, 4, 5 or 6. Otherwise, if the index i is 0 and the first element of a is not larger than 10, then x is 0, y is 0, n is either 2 or 3, and c contains the first element of a. stdin contains either t-3 or t-4 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
