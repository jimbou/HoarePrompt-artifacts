Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, n is either 1 or 2, c is a list with at least two elements, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is the index of an element in a that is greater than 10, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then the last two elements of c are y and x respectively, and n is 2. Otherwise, the first digit of the element in a at index i is greater than or equal to the last element in c, the first digit of the element in a at index i is strictly less than the last digit of the element in a at index i, and n is 1.***
