Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, a is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, x is the last digit of the element in a at index i, y is the first digit of the element in a at index i, n is either 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, c is a list containing either an element of a, or the first and last digits of an element in a, the element in a at index i, and possibly y and x, i is greater than 1, stdin contains either t-3 or t-4 test cases, depending on whether y is less than or equal to x, and y is either greater than or equal to c[n - 1] or less than c[n - 1].***
