Based on the initial state, the code will print the values of `b` and `a`, which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, with `a` being less than `b`. Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical values that will be printed.

However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **[b] [a] (where b is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, a is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, and a is less than b)**
