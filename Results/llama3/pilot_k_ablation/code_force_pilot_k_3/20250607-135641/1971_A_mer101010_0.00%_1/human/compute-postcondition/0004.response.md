The code prints the values of `a` and `b`, which are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, where `a` is greater than `b`. The exact values of `a` and `b` are not specified in the precondition, but it is known that `a` is greater than `b`.

Output: **a (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and greater than b), b (an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive)**
