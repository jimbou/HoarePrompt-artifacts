Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and are the values of the last line of input from stdin, stdin contains no lines. If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` equals `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are printed. Otherwise, "b a" is printed, where `b` and `a` are the last two integers read from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `i`, `a`, and `b` have taken on their final values. The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed `n` iterations. The values of `a` and `b` are the last two integers read from stdin, and their values are printed according to the conditions specified in the loop body. The stdin is now empty, containing no lines.
