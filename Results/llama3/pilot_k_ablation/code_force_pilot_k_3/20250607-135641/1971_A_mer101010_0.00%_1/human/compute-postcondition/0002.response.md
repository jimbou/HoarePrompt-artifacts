The code assigns the values of two space-separated integers from the input to the variables `a` and `b`. The stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). Since `t` is 0, the stdin is empty, so `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the first two integers from the input. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9)**
