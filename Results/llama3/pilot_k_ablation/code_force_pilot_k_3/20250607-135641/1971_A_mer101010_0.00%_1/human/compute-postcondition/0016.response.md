Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The value of `t` is incremented by 1, and the values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two space-separated integers read from the input.
