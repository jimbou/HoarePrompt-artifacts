Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and are the values of the last line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` equals `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are printed. Otherwise, "b a" is printed, where `b` and `a` are the last two integers read from stdin.***
