Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, t is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    if a > b:
        print(a, ' ', b)
    elif a == b:
        print(a, ' ', b)
    else:
        print(b, ' ', a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is equal to `b`, `a` (which is equal to `b`) and `b` (which is equal to `a`) are printed, otherwise `b` and `a` are printed. Stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, then the string "[a] [b]" is printed where [a] and [b] are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then either the string "[a] [b]" is printed where [a] and [b] are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, or the value of `b` followed by a space and then the value of `a` are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and are the values of the last line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` equals `b`, then the values of `a` and `b` are printed. Otherwise, "b a" is printed, where `b` and `a` are the last two integers read from stdin.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
