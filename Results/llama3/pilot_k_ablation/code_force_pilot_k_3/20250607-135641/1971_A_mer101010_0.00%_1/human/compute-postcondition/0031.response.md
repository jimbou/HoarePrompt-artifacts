Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of the variables `a` and `b` as follows:

* `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and are the values of the last line of input from stdin.
* Since `t` is 1, there is only one line of input from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).
* Therefore, `a` is the value of `x` and `b` is the value of `y` in the last line of input from stdin.

Now, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(b, ' ', a)`

This statement prints the value of `b`, followed by a space, and then the value of `a`.

Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, we can conclude that the output will be two single-digit integers separated by a space.

Output: **b (a single-digit integer between 0 and 9)  a (a single-digit integer between 0 and 9)**
