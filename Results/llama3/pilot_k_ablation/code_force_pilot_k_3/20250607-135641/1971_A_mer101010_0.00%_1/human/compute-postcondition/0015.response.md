The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is equal to `b`, `a` (which is equal to `b`) and `b` (which is equal to `a`) are printed, otherwise `b` and `a` are printed. Stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**
