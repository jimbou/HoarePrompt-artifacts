Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, and are the values of the last line of input from stdin, stdin contains `t-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the last line of input from stdin, which contains two space-separated integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. The stdin now contains `t-2` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).
