Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, t is 0, stdin contains t lines, each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since the initial state specifies that the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100), `n` becomes this value. The second line initializes `t` to 0. The rest of the code snippet is not provided, so we only consider the impact of these two lines.

The initial state also mentions that stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` and then `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. After the first line of the code is executed, stdin will contain `t` lines, each with two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, because the first input (the integer `t`) has been consumed by the `int(input())` function.
