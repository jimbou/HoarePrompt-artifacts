The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). If `a` is greater than `b`, then the string "[a] [b]" is printed where [a] and [b] are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then either the string "[a] [b]" is printed where [a] and [b] are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive, or the value of `b` followed by a space and then the value of `a` are printed.**
