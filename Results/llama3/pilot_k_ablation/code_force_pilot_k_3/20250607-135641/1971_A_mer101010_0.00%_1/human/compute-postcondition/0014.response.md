Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9 inclusive. If `a` is greater than `b`, then "[a] [b]" is printed. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, then if `a` is equal to `b`, `a` (which is equal to `b`) and `b` (which is equal to `a`) are printed, otherwise `b` and `a` are printed. Stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9).**
