Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first input. It then prints each pair, either in the original order if the first integer is greater than or equal to the second, or in reverse order if the first integer is less than the second. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to reorder and print the input pairs according to the specified condition.**
