Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `t` is 0, `i` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= `x`, `y` <= 9). Additionally, `a` is less than or equal to `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, then `a` (which is equal to `b`) and `b` (which is equal to `a`) are printed. If `a` is less than `b`, then `b` and `a` are printed, where `b` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and `a` is an integer between 0 and 9 inclusive and `a` is less than `b`.***
