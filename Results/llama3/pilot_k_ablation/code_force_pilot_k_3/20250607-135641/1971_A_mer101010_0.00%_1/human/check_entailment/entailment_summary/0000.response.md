Reasoning:

The program is designed to take two integers as input and output the minimum and maximum of the two integers. The execution summary correctly describes the program's behavior. The program uses a simple if-elif-else statement to determine the order of the output. If a is greater than b, it prints a followed by b. If a is equal to b, it prints a followed by b (which is the same as printing b followed by a, since they are equal). If a is less than b, it prints b followed by a. This logic is correct and matches the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
