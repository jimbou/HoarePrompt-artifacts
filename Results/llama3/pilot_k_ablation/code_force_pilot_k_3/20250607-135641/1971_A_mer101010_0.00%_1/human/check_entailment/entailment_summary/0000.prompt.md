Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You are given two integers x and y .

Output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by the maximum of x and
y .

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 100 ) — the number
of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers x and y
(0 \leq x, y \leq 9 ).

Output

For each test case, output two integers: the minimum of x and y , followed by
the maximum of x and y .

Example

Input

    10
    
    1 9
    
    8 4
    
    1 4
    
    3 4
    
    2 0
    
    2 4
    
    6 9
    
    3 3
    
    0 0
    
    9 9

Output

    1 9
    4 8
    1 4
    3 4
    0 2
    2 4
    6 9
    3 3
    0 0
    9 9

# Program:
def func():
    n = int(input())
    t = 0
    for i in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if a > b:
            print(a, ' ', b)
        elif a == b:
            print(a, ' ', b)
        else:
            print(b, ' ', a)





# Execution Summary:
This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by the first input. It then prints each pair, either in the original order if the first integer is greater than or equal to the second, or in reverse order if the first integer is less than the second. The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to reorder and print the input pairs according to the specified condition.
