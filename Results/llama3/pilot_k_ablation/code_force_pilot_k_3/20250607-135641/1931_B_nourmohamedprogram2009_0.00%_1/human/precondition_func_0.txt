stdin contains multiple inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), then t blocks of two lines each. The first line of each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each block contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
