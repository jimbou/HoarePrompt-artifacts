Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t blocks of two lines each, where the first line of each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line of each block contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    if all(arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] for i in range(n - 1)):
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 0. If arr is a sorted list where each element is less than or equal to the next element, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not in non-decreasing order, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 blocks of two lines each. If the list arr is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 blocks of two lines each, and either 'YES' is printed if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order or 'NO' is printed if the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
