Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 blocks of two lines each.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to a new integer value between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) as it is reassigned from the input. The list `arr` is updated to a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin contains `t-3` blocks of two lines each as two lines are read from stdin for the input of `n` and `arr`.
