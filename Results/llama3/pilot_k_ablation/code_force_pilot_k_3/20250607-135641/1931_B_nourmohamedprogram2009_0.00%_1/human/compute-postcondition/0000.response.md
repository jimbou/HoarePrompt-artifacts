The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first input is an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive).

The stdin now contains t blocks of two lines each, where the first line of each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line of each block contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t blocks of two lines each, where the first line of each block contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line of each block contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n.**
