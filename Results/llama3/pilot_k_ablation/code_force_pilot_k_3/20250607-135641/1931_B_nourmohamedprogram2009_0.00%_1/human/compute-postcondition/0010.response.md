The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 1.**
