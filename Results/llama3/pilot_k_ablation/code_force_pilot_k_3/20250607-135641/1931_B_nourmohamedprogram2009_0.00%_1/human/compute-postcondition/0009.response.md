Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 0. If arr is a sorted list where each element is less than or equal to the next element, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not in non-decreasing order, 'NO' is printed.***
