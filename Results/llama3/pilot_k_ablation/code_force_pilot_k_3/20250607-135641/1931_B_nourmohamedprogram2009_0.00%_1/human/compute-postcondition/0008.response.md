Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 0. There exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not in non-decreasing order, and 'NO' is printed**
