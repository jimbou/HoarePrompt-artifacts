Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 0**

The code reads the first block of two lines from stdin, assigns the integer value of the first line to `n`, and assigns the list of integers from the second line to `arr`. The `sort()` function sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The value of `t` is not modified by the code, and the value of `_` remains 0. The remaining `t-1` blocks of two lines each are still in stdin.
