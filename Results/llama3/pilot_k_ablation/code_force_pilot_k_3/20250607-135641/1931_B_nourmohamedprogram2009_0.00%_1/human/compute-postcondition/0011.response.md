Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 blocks of two lines each.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), which is the input value. The list `arr` is updated to a sorted list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 0 and 10^9 (inclusive), and the sum of these integers is divisible by `n`. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t-2` blocks of two lines each, as two lines have been consumed by the `input()` function.
