The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` blocks of two lines each, where the first line of each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line of each block contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. So for the loop to be executed `_` is 0 and `t` is at least 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` blocks of two lines each, where the first line of each block contains an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line of each block contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, `_` is 0**
