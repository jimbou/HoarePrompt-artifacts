The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` blocks of two lines each. If the list `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**
