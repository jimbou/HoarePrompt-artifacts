Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains 0 blocks of two lines each, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n, _ is t. If arr is a sorted list where each element is less than or equal to the next element, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if there exists at least one pair of adjacent elements in arr that are not in non-decreasing order, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variables have reached their final values. The variable t is now between 0 and 10^4 (inclusive), indicating that all the blocks of input have been processed. The stdin contains 0 blocks of two lines each, indicating that all the input has been consumed. The variable n is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and arr is still a sorted list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of a_i is divisible by n. The variable _ is now equal to t, indicating that the loop has executed t times. The output is either 'YES' if the list arr is sorted in non-decreasing order or 'NO' if the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order.
