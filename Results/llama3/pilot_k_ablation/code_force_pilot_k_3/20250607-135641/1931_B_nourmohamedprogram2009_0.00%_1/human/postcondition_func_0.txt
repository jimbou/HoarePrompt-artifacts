This function reads a series of input blocks from standard input, where each block contains an integer n followed by a list of n integers. It sorts each list of integers and checks if the list is in non-decreasing order. If the list is sorted, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes multiple blocks of input, as specified by the initial integer t, and does not return any value.
