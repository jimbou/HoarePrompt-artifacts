Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the fact that the program sorts the array and then checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one. However, this approach does not take into account the actual constraint of the problem, which is that the sum of the amounts of water in the containers is divisible by the number of containers.

A counterexample is the input:

3
1 2 3

The program will sort the array to [1, 2, 3] and then print 'YES', but the correct answer is 'NO' because it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water per container and then check if it is possible to redistribute the water to make each container have the same amount. This can be done by iterating through the array and checking if the cumulative sum is always greater than or equal to the average amount of water per container multiplied by the current index. If this condition is not met, it means that it is not possible to redistribute the water to make each container have the same amount.
