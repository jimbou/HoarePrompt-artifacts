Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The problem requires determining whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. However, the program only checks if the list of integers is in non-decreasing order after sorting, which is not a sufficient condition to solve the problem.

The correct approach would be to calculate the average amount of water in all containers and then check if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers equal to the average by pouring water from one container to another. This can be done by iterating through the list of integers and checking if the cumulative sum is always greater than or equal to the average multiplied by the current index.

Correctness: **False**
