Reasoning: The given program is incorrect. The problem requires checking if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, which involves pouring water from one container to another where the source container has a lower index than the destination container. However, the program simply checks if the list of water amounts is sorted in non-decreasing order, which is not a correct solution to the problem.

The correct solution would involve checking if the prefix sum of the list is divisible by the number of containers for each prefix. If it is, then it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Correctness: **False**
