Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of test cases `t`, the number of containers `n`, and the amounts of water in each container `arr`.
2. The program sorts the list of water amounts in non-decreasing order using the `sort()` method. This is correct because the problem statement allows pouring water from one container to another only if the source container has a smaller index than the destination container. By sorting the list, we ensure that we can pour water from a container with a smaller index to a container with a larger index.
3. The program checks if the sorted list is in non-decreasing order using the `all()` function with a generator expression. This is correct because if the list is not in non-decreasing order, it means that there is a container with a smaller index that has more water than a container with a larger index, which makes it impossible to pour water from the smaller-indexed container to the larger-indexed container.
4. If the list is in non-decreasing order, the program prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
