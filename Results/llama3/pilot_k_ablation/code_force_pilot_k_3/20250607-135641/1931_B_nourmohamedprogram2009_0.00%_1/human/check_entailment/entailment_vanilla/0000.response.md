Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by sorting the array of water containers and then checking if each container has less than or equal to the amount of water in the next container. However, this approach is incorrect.

The problem statement allows for pouring water from one container to another, as long as the source container has less water than the destination container. This means that the order of the containers matters, and simply sorting the array does not take this into account.

For example, consider the input [4, 5, 2, 1, 3]. The program would sort this array to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and then incorrectly conclude that it is not possible to make the amounts of water equal, because the first container has less water than the second.

However, it is actually possible to make the amounts of water equal by pouring water from the second container to the first, and then from the third container to the second, and so on.

A correct solution would involve checking if the cumulative sum of the water amounts is always less than or equal to the average amount of water, which is the total amount of water divided by the number of containers.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
