Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 4999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed.**

The value of t is decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 4999 inclusive. The values of n and A are not affected, so they remain the same. The stdin still contains t test cases, but since t has been decremented, the number of test cases has decreased by 1. The sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is still being printed.
