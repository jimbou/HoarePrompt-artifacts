Output State: **t is an integer between -1 and 4998 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between -1 and 4998 inclusive. The values of n and A remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin still contains t test cases, but the number of test cases has decreased by 1. The sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is still being printed.
