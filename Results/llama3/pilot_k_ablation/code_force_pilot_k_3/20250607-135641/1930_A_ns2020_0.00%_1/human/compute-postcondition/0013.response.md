The code prints the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A.
Since the exact list A is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A.
Output: **the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A**
