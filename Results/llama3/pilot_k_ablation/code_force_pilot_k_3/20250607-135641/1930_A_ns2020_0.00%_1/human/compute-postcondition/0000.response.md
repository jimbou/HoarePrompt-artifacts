The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) followed by `t` test cases. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**
