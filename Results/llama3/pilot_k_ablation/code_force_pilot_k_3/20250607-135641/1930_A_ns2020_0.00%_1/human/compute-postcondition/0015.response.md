The value of `t` is decremented by 1, and the value of `t` was between 1 and 4998 inclusive. Therefore, the value of `t` is now between 0 and 4997 inclusive. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin contains t-2 test cases, and since t has been decremented by 1, the stdin now contains t-1 test cases. The sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is still being printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 4997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `A` is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed.**
