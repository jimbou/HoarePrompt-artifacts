The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between -1 and 4998 inclusive. For the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 4998 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed**
