According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 4999 inclusive. For the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 4999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed.**
