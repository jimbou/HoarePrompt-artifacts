To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that allows the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, we can see that `t` is already in a state that allows the loop to execute at least once, because it is guaranteed to be greater than zero.

Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `t` or any other variables are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**
