Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains no test cases, and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` will still be an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, representing the number of elements in the list `A`. The list `A` will still contain 2n integers, each between 1 and 10^7 inclusive. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all test cases have been processed. Finally, the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list `A` will be printed, as this is the last operation performed by the loop.
