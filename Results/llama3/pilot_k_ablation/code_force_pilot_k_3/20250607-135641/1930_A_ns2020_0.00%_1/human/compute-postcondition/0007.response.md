Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 4999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, it remains an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of 2n integers from stdin to `A`. Since each integer in the list is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, `A` becomes a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive. The value of `t` is decreased by 1 since one test case has been processed.
