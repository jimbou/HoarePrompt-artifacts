Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(sum(A[::2]))
    t = t - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 4999 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the sum of every other element of the list A starting from the first element is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between -1 and 4998 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 4997 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, `A` is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
