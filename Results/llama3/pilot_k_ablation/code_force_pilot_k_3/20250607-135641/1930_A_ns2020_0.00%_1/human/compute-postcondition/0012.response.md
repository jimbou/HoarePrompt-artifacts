Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 4998 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the sum of all the elements at even indices of the list A is being printed**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, the new value of `n` is also an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of 2n integers to `A`, where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive. The sum of all the elements at even indices of the list `A` is being printed. No other variables are affected.
