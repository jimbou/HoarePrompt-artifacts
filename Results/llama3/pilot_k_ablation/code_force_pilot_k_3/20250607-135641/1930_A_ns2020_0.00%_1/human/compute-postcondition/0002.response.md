Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, A is a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `n` becomes an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The second line assigns a list of 2n integers to `A`. Since each integer `a_i` is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive, `A` becomes a list of 2n integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^7 inclusive. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and stdin now contains `t-1` test cases.
