Postcondition: **`x` is the number of test cases, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. The current value of `a[2 * i]` is less than `x`. The current value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`. The program has not skipped the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and continues executing the rest of the code.**
