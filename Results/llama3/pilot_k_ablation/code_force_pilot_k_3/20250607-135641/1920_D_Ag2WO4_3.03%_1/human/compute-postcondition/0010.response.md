Postcondition: **`x` is the remainder of the division of the original value of `x` by `a[2 * i + 1]`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. The current value of `a[2 * i]` is less than the original value of `x`. The current value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than the original value of `x`. The program has not skipped the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and continues executing the rest of the code. Additionally, the current value of `x` is 0.**
