Postcondition: ***`x` is the number of test cases, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. If the current value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, the program continues executing the rest of the code in the current iteration.***
