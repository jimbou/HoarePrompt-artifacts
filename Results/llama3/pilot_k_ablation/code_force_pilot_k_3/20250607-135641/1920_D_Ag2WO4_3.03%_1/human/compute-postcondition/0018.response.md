Output State: **`x` is not equal to 0, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 3` and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `continue` statement only skips to the next iteration of the most internal loop and does not affect the values of the variables. The relationship between `i` and `f` is still valid, where `i` is equal to `f - 3`.
