Output State: **The program returns the third test case, which is a list of integers containing the number of operations, the number of queries, followed by the operations and queries.**

Note: Since `x` is the number of test cases, `b[x]` will return the third test case (assuming 0-based indexing). The exact contents of this test case are not specified, but based on the initial state, it will be a list of integers containing the number of operations, the number of queries, followed by the operations and queries.
