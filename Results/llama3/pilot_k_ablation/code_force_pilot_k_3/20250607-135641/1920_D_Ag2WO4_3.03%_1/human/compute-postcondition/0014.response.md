To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `f`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is greater than -1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `f - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `f - 2`.

The state of `f` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `x` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it. However, we can infer that `x` is still not equal to 0, as it was not equal to 0 at the end of the last iteration.

The state of `a[2 * i]` and `a[2 * i + 1]` is not directly related to the loop head, so we cannot adjust it. However, we can infer that the values of `a[2 * i]` and `a[2 * i + 1]` are still less than the original value of `x`, as they were less than the original value of `x` at the end of the last iteration.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` is not equal to 0, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 2`.**

Note that we cannot provide more specific information about the values of `x`, `f`, `a[2 * i]`, and `a[2 * i + 1]`, as they are not directly related to the loop head and their values are not modified in the loop head.
