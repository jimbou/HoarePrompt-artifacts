Postcondition: ***`x` is the number of test cases, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. If the current value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop is skipped and the program moves to the next iteration. Otherwise, if `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`, then `x` is the remainder of the division of the original value of `x` by `a[2 * i + 1]`, `a[2 * i]` is less than the original value of `x`, `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than the original value of `x`, and the program continues executing the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop. In this case, `x` is not equal to 0.***
