Output State: **`x` is not equal to 0, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 2`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged, as the `continue` statement only skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without modifying any variables.
