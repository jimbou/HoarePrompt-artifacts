Functionality: **This function takes a list of test cases and an integer as input, and returns a specific test case based on the value of the integer and the conditions specified in the function. If the integer is equal to the number of test cases, the function returns the third test case. Otherwise, it iterates through the test cases in reverse order, applying certain conditions to the integer and returning a test case if the conditions are met. If no test case is returned, the function returns the test case corresponding to the final value of the integer.**
