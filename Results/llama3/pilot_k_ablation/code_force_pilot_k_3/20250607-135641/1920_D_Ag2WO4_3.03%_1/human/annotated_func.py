#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers where the first element is the number of test cases, and each test case is a list of integers where the first two elements are the number of operations and the number of queries, followed by the operations and queries. Each operation is a list of two integers where the first integer is the type of operation (1 or 2) and the second integer is the value associated with the operation. Each query is an integer representing the index of the element in the array.
    x = int(x)
    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the third test case, which is a list of integers containing the number of operations, the number of queries, followed by the operations and queries.
    #State: `x` is the number of test cases, which is an integer, and the rest of the test cases are lists of integers where the first two elements are the number of operations and the number of queries, followed by the operations and queries. Additionally, `f` is not equal to 0.
    for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[2 * i] >= x:
            continue
        
        if a[2 * i + 1] < x:
            x %= a[2 * i + 1]
            if x == 0:
                return b[a[2 * i + 1]]
            if a[2 * i] >= x:
                continue
        
        return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is not equal to 0, `f` is 0, `i` is -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of test cases and an integer as input, and returns a specific test case based on the value of the integer and the conditions specified in the function. If the integer is equal to the number of test cases, the function returns the third test case. Otherwise, it iterates through the test cases in reverse order, applying certain conditions to the integer and returning a test case if the conditions are met. If no test case is returned, the function returns the test case corresponding to the final value of the integer.
