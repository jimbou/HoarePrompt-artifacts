Reasoning:
The provided program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly handles the two types of operations (appending an integer and appending copies of the array) and efficiently answers queries about the k-th element of the array after all operations.

The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the values of the elements in the array. The variable `f` is used to count the number of times the array is copied.

The program correctly handles the case where the array is copied, by updating the size of the array and the values of the elements in the array. It also correctly handles the case where the array is not copied, by simply updating the size of the array.

The function `func_1` is used to answer queries about the k-th element of the array. It correctly handles the case where the array is not copied, by simply returning the value of the k-th element. It also correctly handles the case where the array is copied, by recursively finding the k-th element in the copied array.

The execution summary is not directly related to the provided program, but it seems to be a description of a different function that takes a list of test cases and an integer as input and returns a specific test case based on certain conditions.

Correctness: **True**
