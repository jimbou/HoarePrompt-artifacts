Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array a after a series of operations. The operations can either append an integer x to the end of the array or append x copies of the array to the end of the array.

The program uses a list a to keep track of the size of the array after each operation. It also uses a dictionary b to store the values of the integers appended to the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and the number of queries. It then reads the operations and stores the values in the dictionary b.

After reading all the operations, the program reads the queries and for each query, it calls the function func_1 to determine the k-th element of the array.

The function func_1 takes an integer x as input and returns the k-th element of the array. It first checks if the array has been copied (i.e., if f is not equal to 0). If the array has been copied, it iterates over the list a in reverse order to find the appropriate range for the query. If the array has not been copied, it simply returns the value stored in the dictionary b.

The program then prints the results of the queries.

However, there are a few issues with the program. The function func_1 is not defined correctly. It should be defined as a function that takes an integer x as input and returns the k-th element of the array. Also, the variable r is not defined in the print statement.

Correctness: **False**
