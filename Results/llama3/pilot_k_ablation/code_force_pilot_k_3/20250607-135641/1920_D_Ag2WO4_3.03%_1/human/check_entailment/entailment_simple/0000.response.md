Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the value of each element in the array. The program then uses a loop to process each query, and for each query, it uses another loop to find the corresponding element in the array.

The program handles the case where the query index is within the range of the array size after the last operation (i.e., `f == 0`) by directly returning the value from the dictionary `b`. For other cases, it uses a loop to find the corresponding element in the array by repeatedly applying the modulo operation to the query index until it falls within the range of the array size after the last operation.

The program also correctly handles the case where the query index is 0 by returning the last element of the array.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
