Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input query is equal to the size of the array after finishing all operations. In this case, the program will throw an error because it tries to access an index that is out of range.

For example, if the input is:

4
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will throw an error when trying to access the index 20, because the size of the array is 20, but the indices only go up to 19.

This is because the program uses the modulo operator to find the index of the query in the array, but it does not handle the case where the query is equal to the size of the array.
