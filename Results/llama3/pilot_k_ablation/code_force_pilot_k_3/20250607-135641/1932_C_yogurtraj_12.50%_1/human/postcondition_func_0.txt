This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts an integer t, representing the number of test cases, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two integers n and m, a list of n integers a, and a string t of length n containing 'L' and 'R' characters. The function calculates a value k based on the input and prints the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k repeated n-1 times in reverse order. The function performs this process for each test case and then terminates, leaving stdin empty.
