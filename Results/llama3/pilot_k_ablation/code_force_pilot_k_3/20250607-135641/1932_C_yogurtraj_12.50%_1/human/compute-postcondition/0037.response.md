Output State: **ii is 1, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k, k is the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of k and the (q2+1)-th element of a by m, q2 is q2+1, q1 is l - 2 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 1 if t[-1] != 'L', i is n-2, and the current value of t[i] is 'R', and stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of k and the (q2+1)-th element of a by m. The value of q2 has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
