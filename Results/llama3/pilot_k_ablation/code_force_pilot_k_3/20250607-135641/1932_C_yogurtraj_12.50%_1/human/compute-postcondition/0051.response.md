Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k` plus a space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is either the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of `k` and the `(q2+1)`-th element of `a` by `m` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of `k` and the `(q1+1)`-th element of `a` by `m` if `t[i] != 'R'`, `q2` is either `q2+1` if `t[i] == 'R'`, or either `l` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l + 1` if `t[-1] != 'L'` if `t[i] != 'R'`, `q1` is either `l - 2` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l - 1` if `t[-1] != 'L'` or either `l - 3` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l - 2` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `i` is `n-4`, and stdin contains `t-4` test cases.**

The code appends a space and the string representation of `k` to the end of the string `y`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
