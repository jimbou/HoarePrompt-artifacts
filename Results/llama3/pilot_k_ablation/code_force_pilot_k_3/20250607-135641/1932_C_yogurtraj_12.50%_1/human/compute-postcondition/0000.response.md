To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `ii` and the input from `stdin`. Since `ii` is the loop variable and its range is determined by the input from `stdin`, we need to ensure that `stdin` contains at least one integer `t` that is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, ii is 0, t must be greater than 0**
