To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ii in range(int(input())):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `ii`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `ii` and the value returned by `int(input())`. If `ii` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `ii` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `ii` must be increased by 1, so `ii` is 1. The value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` repeated `n-1` times, `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m` or the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or `q1`, `i` is -1, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, and the reverse of the string `y` is being printed**
