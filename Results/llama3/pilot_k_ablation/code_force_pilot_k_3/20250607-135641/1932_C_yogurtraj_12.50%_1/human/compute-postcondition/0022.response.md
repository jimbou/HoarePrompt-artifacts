Output State: **ii is 0, n is at least 2, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, k is the remainder of the product of the original value of k and the integer at index q1 of list a divided by m, q1 is q1 - 1, q2 is either q2 + 1 or q2, i is -1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this final state, the value of `k` has been updated to be the remainder of the product of its original value and the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`. The value of `q1` has been decremented by 1. The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `l`, `y`, `q2`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin remains `t-1`.
