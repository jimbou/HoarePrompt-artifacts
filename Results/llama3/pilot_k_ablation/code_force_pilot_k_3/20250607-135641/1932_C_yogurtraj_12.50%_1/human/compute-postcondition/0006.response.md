Postcondition: ***ii is 0, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the last character of t is 'L', k is the remainder of the integer at index l-1 of list a divided by m, and q1 is l-2, q2 is l. Otherwise, k is the remainder of a[l] divided by m, q1 is l - 1, and q2 is l + 1.***
