The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the values of variables `k`, `q1`, and `q2`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line assigns the value of `a[l] % m` to `k`. Since `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer, and `m` is an integer, `k` becomes the remainder of the division of the `l`-th element of `a` by `m`.

The second line assigns the value of `l - 1` to `q1`. This decrements the value of `l` by 1 and assigns it to `q1`.

The third line assigns the value of `l + 1` to `q2`. This increments the value of `l` by 1 and assigns it to `q2`.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet.

Output State: **ii is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k repeated n-1 times, k is the remainder of the division of the l-th element of a by m, q2 is l + 1, q1 is l - 1, i is -1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
