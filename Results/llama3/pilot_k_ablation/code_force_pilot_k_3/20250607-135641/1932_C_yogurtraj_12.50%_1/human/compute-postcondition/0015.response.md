The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is greater than -1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-2`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is decreased by 1 so `i` is `n-3` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l` of list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of `a[l+1]` divided by `m` if the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l-1` of list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`. `q1` is `l-2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l-3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `q2` is `l+1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2` if the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`. `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n-3`.**
