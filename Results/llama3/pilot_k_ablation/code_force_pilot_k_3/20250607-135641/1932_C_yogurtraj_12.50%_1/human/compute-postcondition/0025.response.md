Output State: `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` for `n-1` times, `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m` or the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or `q1`, `i` is -1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `y` is a string that contains the string representation of `k` followed by a space, repeated `n-1` times. The value of `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m`, or the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`. The values of `q2` and `q1` are either incremented or decremented by 1, depending on the condition in the loop. The loop counter `i` is -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The number of test cases in stdin remains unchanged.
