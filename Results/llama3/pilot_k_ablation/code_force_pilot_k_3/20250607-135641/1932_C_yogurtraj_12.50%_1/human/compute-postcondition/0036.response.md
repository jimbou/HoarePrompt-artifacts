Postcondition: **`ii` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k`, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or the remainder of the division of the `l`-th element of `a` by `m` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `q2` is `l` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l + 1` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `q1` is `l - 2` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l - 1` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `i` is `n-2`, and the current value of `t[i]` is 'R', and stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**
