Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, `i` is -1, `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m` or the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or `q1`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ii` remains 0, `n` is still at least 2, `m` is still an integer, `a` is still a list of integers, `t` is still a string, `l` is still an integer, and `y` has an additional string representation of `k` followed by a space appended to it. The value of `i` is now -1. The value of `k` is updated based on the previous value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` or `q1` of list `a`, divided by `m`. The values of `q2` and `q1` are also updated. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
