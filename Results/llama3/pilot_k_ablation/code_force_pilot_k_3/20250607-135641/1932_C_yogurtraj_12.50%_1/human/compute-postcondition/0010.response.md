Output State: **ii is 0, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, k is the remainder of the integer at index l of list a divided by m if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise k is the remainder of a[l+1] divided by m, q1 is l-2 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q1 is l - 1, q2 is l+1 if the last character of t is 'L', otherwise q2 is l + 2, y is the string representation of k, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is n-2, and the current character at index i of string t is 'R'.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be the remainder of the product of the previous value of k and the integer at index q2 of list a, divided by m. The value of q2 has also been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
