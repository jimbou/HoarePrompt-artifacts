Postcondition: ***ii is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k repeated n-1 times, k is either a[l - 1] % m if t[-1] == 'L' or the remainder of the division of the l-th element of a by m if t[-1] != 'L', q2 is l if t[-1] == 'L' or l + 1 if t[-1] != 'L', q1 is l - 2 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 1 if t[-1] != 'L', i is -1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.***
