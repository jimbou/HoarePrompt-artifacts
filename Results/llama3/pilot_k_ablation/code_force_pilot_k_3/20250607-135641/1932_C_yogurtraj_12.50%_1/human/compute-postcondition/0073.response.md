Postcondition: ***ii is 2, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k, k is an integer, i is n-2. If the character at index i of string t is 'R', then k is updated to (k * a[q2]) % m and q2 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, k is updated to (k * a[q1]) % m and q1 is decremented by 1.***
