Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l-1` of list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l-2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is determined based on the last character of `t` and the corresponding element in list `a`. The values of `q1` and `q2` are also determined based on the last character of `t` and the value of `l`. A new variable `y` is introduced, which is the string representation of `k`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1.
