Postcondition: ***ii is 2, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, k is an integer, q1 and q2 are integers, i is n-3. If the character at index i of string t is 'R', then k is updated to its original value times a[q2] modulo m and q2 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, k is updated to its original value times the integer at index q1 in list a modulo m and q1 is decremented by 1.***
