The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the values of variables `k`, `q1`, and `q2`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line assigns the value of `a[l - 1] % m` to `k`. Since `a` is a list of integers, `l` is an integer, and `m` is an integer, the expression `a[l - 1] % m` evaluates to an integer. This value is assigned to `k`, which was initially 0.

The second line assigns the value of `l - 2` to `q1`. Since `l` is an integer, the expression `l - 2` evaluates to an integer. This value is assigned to `q1`, which was initially 0.

The third line assigns the value of `l` to `q2`. Since `l` is an integer, this value is assigned to `q2`, which was initially 0.

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, `y`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.

Output State: **ii is 1, n is an integer, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k repeated n-1 times, k is a[l - 1] % m, q2 is l, q1 is l - 2, i is -1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
