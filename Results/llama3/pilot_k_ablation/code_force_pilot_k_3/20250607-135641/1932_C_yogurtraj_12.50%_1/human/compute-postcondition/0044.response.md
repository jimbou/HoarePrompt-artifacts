Output State: **ii is 1, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k, k is the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of k and the (q1+1)-th element of a by m, q2 is either q2+1 if the current character of t is 'R', or l if t[-1] == 'L' or l + 1 if t[-1] != 'L' if the current character of t is not 'R', q1 is either l - 2 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 1 if t[-1] != 'L' if the current character of t is 'R', or l - 3 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 2 if t[-1] != 'L' if the current character of t is not 'R', i is n-3, and stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The code modifies the value of k by multiplying it with the (q1+1)-th element of a and taking the remainder of the division by m. The value of q1 is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
