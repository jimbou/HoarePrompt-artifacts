The first line of code multiplies `k` by the integer at index `q1` in list `a`, then takes the modulus of the result with `m`, and assigns this new value back to `k`. The second line decrements `q1` by 1.

Output State: **ii is 2, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, k is an integer equal to its original value times the integer at index q1 in list a modulo m, q1 is an integer equal to its original value minus 1, q2 is an integer, i is n-3**
