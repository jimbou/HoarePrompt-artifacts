Postcondition: **ii is 1, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k. If the current character of t is 'R', then k is the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of k and the (q2+1)-th element of a by m, q2 is q2+1, and q1 is either l - 2 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 1 if t[-1] != 'L'. Otherwise, k is the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of k and the (q1+1)-th element of a by m, q2 is either l if t[-1] == 'L' or l + 1 if t[-1] != 'L', and q1 is either l - 3 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 2 if t[-1] != 'L'. In both cases, i is n-3, and stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
