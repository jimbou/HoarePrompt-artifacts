Output: **`ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` repeated `n-1` times, `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m` or the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or `q1`, `i` is -1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and the reverse of the string `y` is being printed**
