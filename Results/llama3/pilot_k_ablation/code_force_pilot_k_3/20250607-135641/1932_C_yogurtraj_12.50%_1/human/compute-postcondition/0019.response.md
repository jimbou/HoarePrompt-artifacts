Output State: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m` or the remainder of the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or `q1`, `i` is `n-3`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `y` is updated by appending a space and the string representation of `k` to its current value. The values of `k`, `q1`, and `q2` are updated based on the current character at index `i` of string `t`. If the character is 'R', `k` is updated to the remainder of the product of its original value and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m`, and `q2` is incremented. Otherwise, `k` is updated to the remainder of the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, and `q1` is decremented. The values of `ii`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `t`, and `l` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, and `i` is still `n-3`.
