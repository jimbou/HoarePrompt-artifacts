Postcondition: **ii is 2, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, k is an integer, q1 and q2 are integers, i is n-4. If the character at index i in string t is 'R', then k is updated to the original value of k times the integer at index q2 in list a modulo m, and q2 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, k is updated to the remainder of the product of the original k and the integer at index q1 in list a divided by m, and q1 is decremented by 1.**
