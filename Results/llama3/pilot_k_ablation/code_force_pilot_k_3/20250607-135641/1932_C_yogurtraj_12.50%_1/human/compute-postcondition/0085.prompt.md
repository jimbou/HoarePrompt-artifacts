Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ii` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k`, `k` is an integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y += ' ' + str(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is an integer, `i` is `n-2`, `q1` and `q2` are integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ii is 2, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, k is an integer, q1 and q2 are integers, i is n-3. If the character at index i of string t is 'R', then k is updated to its original value times a[q2] modulo m and q2 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, k is updated to its original value times the integer at index q1 in list a modulo m and q1 is decremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ii is 2, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k, k is an integer, q1 and q2 are integers, i is n-4. If the character at index i in string t is 'R', then k is updated to the original value of k times the integer at index q2 in list a modulo m, and q2 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, k is updated to the remainder of the product of the original k and the integer at index q1 in list a divided by m, and q1 is decremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
