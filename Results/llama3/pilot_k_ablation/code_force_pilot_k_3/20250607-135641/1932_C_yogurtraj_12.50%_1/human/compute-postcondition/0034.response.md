Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of k, `k` is either `a[l - 1] % m` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or the remainder of the division of the `l`-th element of `a` by `m` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `q2` is `l` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l + 1` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `q1` is `l - 2` if `t[-1] == 'L'` or `l - 1` if `t[-1] != 'L'`, `i` is -1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `y` has been updated to be the string representation of `k`. The value of `k` is still dependent on the value of `t[-1]` and the elements of `a` and `m`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
