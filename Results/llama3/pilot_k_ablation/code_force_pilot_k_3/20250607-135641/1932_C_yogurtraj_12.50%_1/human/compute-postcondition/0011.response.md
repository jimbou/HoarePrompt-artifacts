Postcondition: **`ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l-1` of list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l-2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n-2`, and the character at index `i` of string `t` is not 'R'.**
