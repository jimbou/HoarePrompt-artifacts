Postcondition: ***ii is 0, n is at least 2, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer, y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k. If t[i] is 'R', k is the remainder of the product of the original value of k and the integer at index q2 of list a divided by m, q2 is q2 + 1, q1 is either q1 - 1 or q1. Otherwise, k is the remainder of the product of the original value of k and the integer at index q1 of list a divided by m, q1 is q1 - 1, q2 is either q2 + 1 or q2. In both cases, i is -1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
