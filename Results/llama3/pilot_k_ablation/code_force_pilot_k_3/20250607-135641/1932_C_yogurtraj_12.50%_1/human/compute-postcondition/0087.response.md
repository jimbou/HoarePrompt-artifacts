The code prints the string `y` in reverse order. The string `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space, repeated 100 times. Therefore, the output will be the string representation of `k` followed by a space, repeated 100 times, in reverse order.

Output: **the string representation of k followed by a space, repeated 100 times, in reverse order**
