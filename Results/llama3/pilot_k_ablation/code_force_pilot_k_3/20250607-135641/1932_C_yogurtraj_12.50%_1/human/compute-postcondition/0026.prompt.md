Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ii` is 0, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l-1` of list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`, `q1` is `l-2` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1`, `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`, `y` is the string representation of `k`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
    if t[i] == 'R':
        k = k * a[q2] % m
        q2 += 1
    else:
        k = k * a[q1] % m
        q1 -= 1
    y += ' ' + str(k)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l` of list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of `a[l+1]` divided by `m` if the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `k` is the remainder of the integer at index `l-1` of list `a` divided by `m` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `k` is the remainder of `a[l]` divided by `m`. `q1` is `l-2` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l - 1` if the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q1` is `l-3` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q1` is `l - 2`. `q2` is `l+1` if the last character of `t` is 'L' and the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l + 2` if the current character at index `i` of string `t` is 'R', otherwise `q2` is `l` if the last character of `t` is 'L', otherwise `q2` is `l + 1`. `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is `n-2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `ii` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m` or the remainder of the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or `q1`, `i` is `n-3`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `ii` is 0, `n` is at least 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k` followed by a space and the string representation of `k`, `i` is -1, `k` is either the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q2` of list `a` divided by `m` or the remainder of the product of the original value of `k` and the integer at index `q1` of list `a` divided by `m`, `q2` is either `q2 + 1` or `q2`, `q1` is either `q1 - 1` or `q1`, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
