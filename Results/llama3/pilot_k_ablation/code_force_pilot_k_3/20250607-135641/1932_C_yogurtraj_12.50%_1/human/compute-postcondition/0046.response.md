Output State: **`ii` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `t` is a string, `l` is an integer, `y` is the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k plus a space and the string representation of k, `k` is either the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of k and the (q2+1)-th element of a by m or the remainder of the division of the product of the previous value of k and the (q1+1)-th element of a by m, `q2` is either q2+1 or either l if t[-1] == 'L' or l + 1 if t[-1] != 'L', `q1` is either l - 2 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 1 if t[-1] != 'L' or either l - 3 if t[-1] == 'L' or l - 2 if t[-1] != 'L', `i` is n-3, and stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `ii` remains 1, `n` is still at least 3, `m` is still an integer, `a` is still a list of integers, `t` is still a string, `l` is still an integer, `y` now includes an additional string representation of `k` plus a space, `k` is updated based on the previous value of `k` and the elements of `a` and `m`, `q2` and `q1` are updated based on the value of `t[-1]` and `l`, `i` is now `n-3`, and there are `t-4` test cases remaining in stdin.
