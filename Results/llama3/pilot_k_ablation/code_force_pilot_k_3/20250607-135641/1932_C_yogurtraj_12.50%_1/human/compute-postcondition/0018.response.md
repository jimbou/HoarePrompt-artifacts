Postcondition: **ii is 0, n is at least 3, m is an integer, a is a list of integers, t is a string, l is an integer. If the current character at index i of string t is 'R', then k is the remainder of the product of the original value of k and the integer at index q2 of list a divided by m, q2 is q2 + 1, and y is the string representation of the new value of k followed by a space and the string representation of the new value of k. Otherwise, k is the remainder of the integer at index q1 of list a divided by m, q1 is q1 - 1, and y is the string representation of k followed by a space and the string representation of k. In both cases, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and i is n-3.**
