Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, if the input is:

4 6
3 1 4 2
RLLR

The program will output:

0 2 4 1

However, the correct output should be:

0 2 4 4

This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when the command is 'R' and the array has an even number of elements. In this case, the program should remove the rightmost element from the array, but it does not do so correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the Correctness is **False**.
