Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly processes the input commands and calculates the remainder of the product of the array elements at each step. The program uses a clever approach to calculate the product in reverse order, starting from the last command and moving backwards. This allows it to avoid recalculating the product from scratch at each step, which would be inefficient for large inputs.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element or when the command string consists only of 'L' or 'R' characters. The output is also formatted correctly, with the remainders printed in reverse order.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and correct.

Correctness: **True**
