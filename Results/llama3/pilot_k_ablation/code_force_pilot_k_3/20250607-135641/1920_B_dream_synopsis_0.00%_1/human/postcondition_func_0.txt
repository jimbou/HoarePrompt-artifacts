This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers: n, k, and x. The second line contains n integers. The function sorts these integers in descending order, calculates a series of sums by subtracting twice the sum of the first x+1 integers and then iteratively adding or subtracting integers based on their position and the value of x, and finally prints the maximum sum calculated. The function repeats this process for each test case until standard input is empty.
