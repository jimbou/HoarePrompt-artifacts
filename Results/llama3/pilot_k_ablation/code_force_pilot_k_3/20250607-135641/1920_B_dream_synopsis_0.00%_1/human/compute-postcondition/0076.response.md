Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the value of sums. If i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is increased by a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, sums is increased by a[i - 1].***
