Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is increased by 2, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if (i + x - 1) is less than n, then ans is a list containing the value of sum1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans is a list containing the value of sums increased by a[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if i is 1, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). If (i + x - 1) is less than n, then sums is increased by a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1] and ans is a list containing the value of sums. Otherwise, sums is increased by a[i - 1] and ans is a list containing the value of sums.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
