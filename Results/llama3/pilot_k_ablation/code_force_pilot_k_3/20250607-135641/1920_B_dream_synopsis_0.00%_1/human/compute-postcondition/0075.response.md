Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the value of sums, sums is increased by a[i - 1].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `sums` and `ans`. The value of `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`, which is an integer in the sorted list `a`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the new value of `sums` to the list. All other variables remain unchanged.
