Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x+1` integers in `a`. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list with one element which is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, `i` is `i+1`, `ans` is a list with two elements. If `i` is 0, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`, and the second element is the value of `sums`. Otherwise, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`, and the second element is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1` if `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to i+2, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, i is i+2, ans is a list with two or three elements. If i is 0, the first element of ans is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1, and the second element is the value of sums. Otherwise, the first element of ans is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1, and the second element is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 if i + x - 1 is not less than n, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i. If i is not 0, the third element of ans is the value of sums after the modification if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the third element is the value of sums.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
