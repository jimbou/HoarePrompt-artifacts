Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `_`, and `i` are unchanged. If `i` is 0, `ans` is appended with the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is updated with a new value which is the sum of the previous value of `sums`, `a[i - 1]`, and `-2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`, and `ans` has an additional element which is the new value of `sums`.**
