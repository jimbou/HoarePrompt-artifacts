Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `_`, and `i` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `i - 1`.***
