Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three space-separated integers: n, k, and x (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, k <= n). The second line contains n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 1000).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, ans is a list of integers, _ is 0, and the maximum value in the list ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The final output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, and `_` remain unchanged. `k` is increased by the number of iterations. `ans` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `i - 1`, where `i` is the current iteration. The cumulative sums are calculated based on the conditions in the loop body, and the maximum cumulative sum in the `ans` list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by k + 1, the number of iterations is increased by k + 1. ans is a list containing the value of sums. If i is 0, sums is equal to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). If i is not 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is increased by a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, sums is increased by a[i - 1]., and the maximum value from the list ans is printed, which is the maximum calculated sum of the integers in the list a after the specified operations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
