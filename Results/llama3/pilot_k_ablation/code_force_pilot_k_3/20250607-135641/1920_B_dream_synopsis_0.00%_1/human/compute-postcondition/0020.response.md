Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to i+2, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, i is i+2, ans is a list with three elements. If i is 0, the first element of ans is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1, and the second element is the value of sums. Otherwise, the first element of ans is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1, and the second element is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 if i + x - 1 is not less than n, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i. The third element of ans is the value of sums after the modification.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been modified by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. This new value of `sums` is then appended to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
