To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. The loop will execute if `k` is at least 0, because the range function in Python generates numbers from 0 up to but not including the stop value, which is `k + 1` in this case.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is unknown (but not 0), `i` is 0**
