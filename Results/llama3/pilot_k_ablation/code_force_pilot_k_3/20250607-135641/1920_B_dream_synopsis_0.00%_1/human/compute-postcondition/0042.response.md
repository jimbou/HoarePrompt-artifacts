Output State: **n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin, _, and i are unchanged, sums is increased by a[i - 1], ans has an additional element which is the new value of sums.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `sums` and `ans`. The value of `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`, and `ans` has an additional element which is the new value of `sums`. The value of `i` is still less than `k + 1`, but it is not modified by the code snippet.
