Output State: **n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin, _, and i are unchanged, ans is updated with a new value which is the sum of the previous value of sums, a[i - 1], and -2 * a[i + x - 1].**

Explanation:
The first line updates the value of `sums` by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`. Since `i` is increased by 1 and is less than `k + 1`, the value of `i` is used to index the list `a`. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, and `_` are not modified by the code.
