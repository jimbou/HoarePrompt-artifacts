Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list with one element which is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`.***
