The only variable in the loop head is variable _ , so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of iterations, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is equal to the number of iterations. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1 and the number of iterations must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin` remain unchanged, `k` is increased by the number of iterations + 1, `ans` is a list containing the cumulative sums of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `i`, where `i` is the current iteration, `_` is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1**
