Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a sorted list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `_` is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1, `i` is increased by 1. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`.***
