Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, `i` is not equal to 0. The current value of `i + x - 1` is less than `n`.**
