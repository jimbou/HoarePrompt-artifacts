The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `k` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than or equal to `i`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, `i` is `i+1`, `ans` is a list with one element which is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`**
