Postcondition: ***n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin, _, and i are unchanged. If i + x - 1 is less than n, ans is updated with a new value which is the sum of the previous value of sums, a[i - 1], and -2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, sums is increased by a[i - 1], ans has an additional element which is the new value of sums.***
