The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i+1`, `k` is greater than or equal to `i+1`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `i+2` and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to `i+2`.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to `i+2`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, `i` is `i+2`, `ans` is a list with two elements. If `i` is 0, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`, and the second element is the value of `sums`. Otherwise, the first element of `ans` is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1`, and the second element is the value of `sums` + `a[i - 1]` - 2 * `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1` if `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, otherwise the second element is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i`.**
