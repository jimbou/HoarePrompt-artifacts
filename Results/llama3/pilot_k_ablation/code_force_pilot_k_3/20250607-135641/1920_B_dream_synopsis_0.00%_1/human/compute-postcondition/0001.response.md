Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers.**

The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively. The second line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns them to `a`. The third line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The fourth line reverses the sorted list `a`, making it in descending order. The fifth line calculates the sum of the integers in `a` and assigns it to `sum1`. The sixth line initializes an empty list `ans`. The variable `_` remains unchanged, and stdin now contains multiple test cases minus the two inputs that were read.
