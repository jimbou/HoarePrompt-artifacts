The code prints the maximum value in the `ans` list.
Since the exact values in the `ans` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `max(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value in the `ans` list.
Output: **max(ans) (where max(ans) is the maximum value in the ans list)**
