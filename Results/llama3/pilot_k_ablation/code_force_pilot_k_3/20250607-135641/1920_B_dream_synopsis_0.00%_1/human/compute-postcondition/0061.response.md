Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1, i is not equal to 0, the current value of (i + x - 1) is less than n, and sums is the value of sum1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` from `sum1`. The value of `ans` has been updated by appending the new value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
