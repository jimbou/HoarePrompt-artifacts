Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers, ans is an empty list, _ is unknown (but not 0)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `_`, and `i` are as described in the precondition. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index 0 to `i - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `_`, and `i` are unchanged. If `i` is 0, `ans` is appended with the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is updated with a new value which is the sum of the previous value of `sums`, `a[i - 1]`, and `-2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is increased by `a[i - 1]`, and `ans` has an additional element which is the new value of `sums`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin, _, and i are unchanged and increased by 1. If i is 0, ans contains the value of sums, and sums is the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). If i is not 0, then if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans has a new element appended which is the value of sums after the execution of the code, and sums is the value of sums after the execution of the code. Otherwise, ans has an additional element which is the sum of sums and a[i - 1], and sums is increased by a[i - 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
