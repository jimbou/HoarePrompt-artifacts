Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list with one element which is the value of sums, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, i is not equal to 0, sums is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

The code modifies the values of `sums` and `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the new value of `sums`. No other variables are affected.
