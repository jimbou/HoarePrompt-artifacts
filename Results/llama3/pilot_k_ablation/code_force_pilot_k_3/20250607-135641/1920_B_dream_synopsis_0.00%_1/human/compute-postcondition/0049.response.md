Postcondition: ***n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin, ans, _, and i are unchanged and increased by 1. If i + x - 1 is less than n, ans has a new element appended which is the value of sums after the execution of the code, and sums is the value of sums after the execution of the code. Otherwise, ans has an additional element which is the sum of sums and a[i - 1], and sums is increased by a[i - 1].***
