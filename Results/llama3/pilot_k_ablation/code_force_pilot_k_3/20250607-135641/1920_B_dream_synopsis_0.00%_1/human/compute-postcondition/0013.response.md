Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to i+1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, i is i+1, ans is a list with two elements, the first element is the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise the first element is the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1, and the second element is the value of sums.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` is calculated by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a` from `sum1`. This value is then appended to `ans`, which now contains two elements. The first element of `ans` is determined based on the condition `i + x - 1 < n`, and the second element is the value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
