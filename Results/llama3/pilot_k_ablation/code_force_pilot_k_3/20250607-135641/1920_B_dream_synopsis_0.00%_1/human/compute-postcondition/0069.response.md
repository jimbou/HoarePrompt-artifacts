Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1, sums is increased by a[i - 1], ans is a list containing the value of sums.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and stdin remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The variable `_` and the number of iterations are increased by 1, but their exact values are not specified. The variable `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`, and the list `ans` is appended with the new value of `sums`.
