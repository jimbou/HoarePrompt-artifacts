The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 so i is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again k must be increased by 1.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1. If i is 1, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if (i + x - 1) is less than n, then ans is a list containing the value of sum1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans is a list containing the value of sums increased by a[i - 1].**
