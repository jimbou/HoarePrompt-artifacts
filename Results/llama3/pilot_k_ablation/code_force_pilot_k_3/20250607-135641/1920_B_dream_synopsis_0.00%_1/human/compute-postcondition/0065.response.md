Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, _ is increased by 1, the number of iterations is increased by 1. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if (i + x - 1) is less than n, then ans is a list containing the value of sum1 plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, ans is a list containing the value of sums increased by a[i - 1].***
