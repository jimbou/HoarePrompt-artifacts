The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `k` is some value. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `i` must be less than `k + 1`. So `i` is increased by 1 and `k` remains the same.
State: **`n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `_`, and `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than `k + 1`**
