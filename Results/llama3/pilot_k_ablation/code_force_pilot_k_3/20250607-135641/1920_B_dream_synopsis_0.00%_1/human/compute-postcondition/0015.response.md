Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to i+1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers and a list of integers, i is i+1, ans is a list with two elements which are the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans is a list containing the sum of the integers in a up to index i-1 and the sum of the integers in a up to index i.**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is modified by appending the value of `sums` to it. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, the value of `ans` is a list with two elements which are the value of `sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i-1` and the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i`.
