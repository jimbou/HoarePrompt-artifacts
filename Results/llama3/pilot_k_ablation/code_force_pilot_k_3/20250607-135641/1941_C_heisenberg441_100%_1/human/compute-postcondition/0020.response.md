Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than `i`. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+3` is 'pie', then `i` is either 1, 3, or 5 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is either 1, 3, or 5. ***
