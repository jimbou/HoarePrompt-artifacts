Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, ans is 0, i is 0, n is the length of s
Code of the loop:
while i < n:
    if s[i:i + 5] == 'mapie':
        ans += 1
        i += 5
    elif s[i:i + 3] == 'map':
        ans += 1
        i += 3
    elif s[i:i + 3] == 'pie':
        ans += 1
        i += 3
    else:
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is 'mapie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is not 'mapie', then there are three possibilities: if the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is 'map', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3; if the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3; otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than `i`, `i` is either 1, 3, or 5. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+5` is 'mapie', then `i` is either 6, 8, or 10 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+5` is not 'mapie', then if the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+3` is 'map', then `i` is either 4, 6, or 8 and `ans` is one more than its original value. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+3` is 'pie', then `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` remains the same.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 10. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+5` is 'mapie', then `i` is either 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, or 16 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+5` is not 'mapie', then `i` is either 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, or 10. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+3` is 'map', then `i` is either 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+3` is 'pie', then `i` is either 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is either 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, or 11.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
