Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie'. The current value of the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is not 'map'.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `i` has been incremented by 3, making it 3. The value of `s`, `n` remains unchanged. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is still not equal to 'mapie'. The current value of the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is no longer 'map' because `i` has been incremented by 3.
