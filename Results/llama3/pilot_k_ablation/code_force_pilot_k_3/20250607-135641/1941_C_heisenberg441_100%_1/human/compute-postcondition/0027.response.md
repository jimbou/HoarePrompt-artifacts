Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 10, `i` is either 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, or 11**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it can now take on the values 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, or 11. The values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged, with `s` still being a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and `n` still being the length of `s` and greater than 10.
