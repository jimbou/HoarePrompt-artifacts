Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, n is greater than 10, i is either 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, or 13, ans is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` is incremented by 3, so it can take on the values 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, or 13, depending on its initial value. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1.
