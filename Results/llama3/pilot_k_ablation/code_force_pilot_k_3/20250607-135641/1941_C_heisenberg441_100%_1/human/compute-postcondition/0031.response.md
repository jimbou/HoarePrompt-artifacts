Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `ans` is the number of occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in `s`, and `i` is equal to `n`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the variable `ans` now holds the total count of occurrences of the substrings 'mapie', 'map', or 'pie' in the string `s`, and the index `i` has reached the end of the string, indicating that the loop has processed the entire string.
