The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` can be 1, 3, or 5, so the value of `i` is 2, 4, or 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. `s` is still a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, and `n` is still the length of `s` and must be greater than `i`. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than `i`, `i` is either 2, 4, or 6.**
