Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 10. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+5` is 'mapie', then `i` is either 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 15, or 16 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+5` is not 'mapie', then `i` is either 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 8, or 10. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+3` is 'map', then `i` is either 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and `ans` is incremented by 1. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i+3` is 'pie', then `i` is either 4, 6, 8, 7, 9, 11, or 13 and `ans` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is either 2, 4, 6, 5, 7, 9, or 11.***
