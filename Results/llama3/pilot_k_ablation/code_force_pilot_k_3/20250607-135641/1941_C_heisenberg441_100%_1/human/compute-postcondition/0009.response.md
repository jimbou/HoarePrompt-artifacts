Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 1, `i` is 3, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie'. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'map'. The current value of the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is not specified.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by 1, making it 1. It also increments the value of `i` by 3, making it 3. The value of `s` and `n` remains unchanged. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is still not equal to 'mapie', and the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is still not equal to 'map'. However, the current value of the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is no longer specified, as the index `i` has changed.
