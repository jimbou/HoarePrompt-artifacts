The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 1, 3, or 5, and `n` is greater than 0. `n` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than `i`, `i` is either 1, 3, or 5**
