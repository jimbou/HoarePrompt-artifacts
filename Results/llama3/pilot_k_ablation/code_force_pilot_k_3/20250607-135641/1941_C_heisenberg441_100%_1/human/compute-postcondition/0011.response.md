Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie'. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'map'. The substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'pie'.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the substrings of `s` starting at index `i` are still valid, but now they apply to the new value of `i`.
