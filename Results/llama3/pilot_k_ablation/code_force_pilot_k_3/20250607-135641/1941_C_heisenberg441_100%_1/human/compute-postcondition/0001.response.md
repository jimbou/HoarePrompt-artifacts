To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `i < n`. The loop will execute if `i` is less than `n`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters
- `ans` is 0
- `i` is 0
- `n` is the length of `s`

Since `i` is 0 and we need `i` to be less than `n` for the loop to execute, we must ensure that `n` is greater than 0. This means the length of `s` must be greater than 0, implying that `s` must not be an empty string.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `s` is not empty, which directly affects the value of `n`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0**
