Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The program iterates through the string and checks for the occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie'. If any of these substrings are found, it increments the count and moves the index forward by the length of the substring. If none of these substrings are found, it simply moves the index forward by 1. This approach ensures that the program counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
