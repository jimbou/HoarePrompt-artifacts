Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It checks for the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" and increments the count accordingly. The program also handles the case where the string is already beautiful by returning 0.

The program uses a while loop to iterate through the string, and the index `i` is incremented based on the length of the matched substring. This ensures that the program does not miss any substrings and correctly counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The program also handles the edge case where the input string is of length 1, in which case it returns 0.

After analyzing the program, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
