Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program takes the number of test cases `t` and for each test case, it takes two integers `n` and `k` as input.

The program first checks if `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If `n` is equal to `k`, the program prints a list of `k` number of `k`, which is a valid solution because all cyclic shifts of this list are sorted. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid solution.

If `k` is less than 2, the program prints a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`. This is a valid solution because only the cyclic shift that starts with the smallest element (0) is sorted, and there are `k` such shifts.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
