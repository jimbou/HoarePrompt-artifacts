Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n = 3 and k = 1. The program prints the numbers from 0 to n-1, but this does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program prints "0 1 2", but all three cyclic shifts of this array are sorted: [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 0], and [2, 0, 1]. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
