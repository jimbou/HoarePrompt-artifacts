Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts. The program processes each test case based on the value of k.

If k is greater than or equal to 2, the program checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints a list of k repeated k times. This is because when n equals k, the only way to have k sorted cyclic shifts is to have all elements equal, which results in k sorted cyclic shifts. If n is not equal to k, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array.

If k is less than 2, the program prints a list of integers from 0 to n-1. This is because when k is 1, the only way to have exactly one sorted cyclic shift is to have a strictly increasing sequence, which is achieved by printing the numbers from 0 to n-1.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases based on the value of k. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
