Functionality: **This function reads input from standard input, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two integers, n and k. It then processes each test case based on the value of k. If k is greater than or equal to 2, it checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints a list of k repeated k times. Otherwise, it prints -1. If k is less than 2, it prints a list of integers from 0 to n-1. The function does not return any value but prints the results for each test case.**
