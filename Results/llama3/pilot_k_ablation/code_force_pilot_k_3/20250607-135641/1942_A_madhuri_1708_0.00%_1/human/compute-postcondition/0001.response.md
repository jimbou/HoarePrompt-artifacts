Output State: **`open(0)` is a file object with at least two lines, `s` is the second line of the file, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer**.

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers obtained by splitting the second line of the file (`s`) into two parts using the `split()` method, and then converting these parts to integers using the `map(int, ...)` function. The values of `open(0)` and `s` remain unchanged.
