The `print(*[j for j in range(n)])` statement will print a list of integers from 0 to `n-1`, where `n` is an integer.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a list of integers starting from 0 and ending at `n-1`.

Output: **0, 1, 2, ..., n-1 (where n is the value of the integer n)**
