Postcondition: ***`open(0)` is a file object with at least two lines, `s` is the second line of the file, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, `k` repeated `k` times is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is printed.***
