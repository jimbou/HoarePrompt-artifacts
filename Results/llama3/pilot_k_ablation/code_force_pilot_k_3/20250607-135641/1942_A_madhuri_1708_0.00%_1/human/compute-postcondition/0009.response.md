Postcondition: **`open(0)` is a file object with at least two lines, `s` is the second line of the file, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to 2. If `n` is equal to `k`, then `k` repeated `k` times is printed, where `k` is greater than or equal to 2. Otherwise, -1 is printed.**
