Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then for each test case, two integers (n and k) separated by a space. 1 <= k <= n <= 10^3.
Code of the loop:
for s in [*open(0)][1:]:
    n, k = map(int, s.split())
    if k >= 2:
        if n == k:
            print(*[k for j in range(k)])
        else:
            print('-1')
    else:
        print(*[j for j in range(n)])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`open(0)` is a file object with at least two lines, `s` is the second line of the file, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` equals `k`, `k` repeated `k` times is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`open(0)` is a file object with at least three lines, `s` is the third line of the file, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the third line of the file, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the third line of the file. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, `k` is printed `k` times. Otherwise, -1 is printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`open(0)` is a file object with at least four lines, `s` is the fourth line of the file, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the fourth line of the file, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the fourth line of the file. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` number of `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
