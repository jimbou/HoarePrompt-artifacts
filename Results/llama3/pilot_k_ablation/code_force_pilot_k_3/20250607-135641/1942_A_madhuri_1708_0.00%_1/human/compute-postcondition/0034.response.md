Output State: **`open(0)` is a file object with at least `t+1` lines, where `t` is the number of test cases, `s` is the last line of the file, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the last line of the file, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the last line of the file. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` number of `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the file object `open(0)` has at least `t+1` lines, where `t` is the number of test cases. The variables `n` and `k` are integers equal to the first and second integers in the last line of the file, respectively. The loop prints either a list of `k` number of `k` if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is equal to `k`, or -1 if `k` is greater than or equal to 2 and `n` is not equal to `k`, or a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` if `k` is less than 2.
