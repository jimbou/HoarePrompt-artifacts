Postcondition: ***`open(0)` is a file object with at least four lines, `s` is the fourth line of the file, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the fourth line of the file, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the fourth line of the file. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, then if `n` is equal to `k`, a list of `k` number of `k` is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed. If `k` is less than 2, a list of integers from 0 to `n-1` is being printed.***
