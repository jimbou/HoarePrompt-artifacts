Output State: **`open(0)` is a file object with at least four lines, `s` is the fourth line of the file, `n` is an integer equal to the first integer in the fourth line of the file, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer in the fourth line of the file.**

The code `n, k = map(int, s.split())` does not change the values of `n` and `k` because they are already equal to the first and second integers in the fourth line of the file, respectively. The `map(int, s.split())` expression splits the string `s` into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter, converts each string to an integer using the `int` function, and returns a map object. However, since `n` and `k` are already equal to the first and second integers in the fourth line of the file, the assignment does not change their values. The values of the other variables are not affected.
