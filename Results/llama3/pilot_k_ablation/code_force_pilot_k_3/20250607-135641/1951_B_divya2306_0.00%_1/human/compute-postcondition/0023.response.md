Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
