Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is `n`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. The current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`***
