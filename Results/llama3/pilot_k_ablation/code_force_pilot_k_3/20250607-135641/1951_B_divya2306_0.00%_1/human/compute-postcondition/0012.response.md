Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
