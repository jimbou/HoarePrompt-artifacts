Postcondition: ***n and k are integers, a is a list of n integers, wins is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is greater than 0, i is 0. If the current value of a[i] is greater than the current value of a[k - 1], the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
