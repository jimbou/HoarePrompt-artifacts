Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `wins - 1` is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    wins_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute without breaking out of the loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k` and is equal to `wins + 3`, `wins_with_swap` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap + 1`, `k` is greater than `wins_with_swap + 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is increased by 1, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k` and is equal to `wins + 5`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap + 1`, `k` is greater than `wins_with_swap + 2`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
