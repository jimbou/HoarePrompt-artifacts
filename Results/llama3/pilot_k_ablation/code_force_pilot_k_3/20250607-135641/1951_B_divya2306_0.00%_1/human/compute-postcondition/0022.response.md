Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins_with_swap`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still equal to `wins_with_swap`. The condition that `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]` is still true. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
