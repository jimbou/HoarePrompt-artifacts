Output: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than or equal to `k` and is equal to `wins + k - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `k - 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. , and this is printed: the maximum value between `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1` plus the value of the expression `wins > 0` (which is 1 if `wins` is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise)**
