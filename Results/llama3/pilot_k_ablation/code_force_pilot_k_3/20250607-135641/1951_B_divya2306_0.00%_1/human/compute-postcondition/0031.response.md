Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k` and is equal to `wins + 4`, `wins_with_swap` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap + 2`, `k` is greater than `wins_with_swap + 2`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
