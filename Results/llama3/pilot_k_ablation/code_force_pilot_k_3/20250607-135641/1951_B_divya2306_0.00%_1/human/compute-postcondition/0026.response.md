Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k`, `wins_with_swap` is `wins + 2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap + 1`, `k` is greater than `wins_with_swap + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins_with_swap`, `stdin`, `i`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
