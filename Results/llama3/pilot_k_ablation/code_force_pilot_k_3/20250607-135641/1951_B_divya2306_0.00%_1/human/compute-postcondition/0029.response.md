State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k` and is equal to `wins + 4`, `wins_with_swap` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `wins_with_swap + 2`, `k` is greater than `wins_with_swap + 2`.**
