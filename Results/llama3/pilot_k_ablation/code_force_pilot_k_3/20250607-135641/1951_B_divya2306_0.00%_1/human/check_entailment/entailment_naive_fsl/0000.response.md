Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, consider the input:

3
6 1
12 10 14 11 8 3

The program will output 1, but the correct output should be 1. However, if we swap the cow at position 1 with the cow at position 3, the new order will be:

14 10 12 11 8 3

In this case, the cow at position 1 will win 2 matches, but the program will not consider this scenario.

The issue with the program is that it only checks for the number of wins without swapping and with swapping to the left, but it does not consider swapping to the right. It also does not correctly calculate the number of wins after swapping.

To fix this, the program should consider all possible swaps and calculate the maximum number of wins.
