Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it's possible to build a tower with a certain number of cubes after a given number of moves. The program correctly handles multiple test cases from standard input and checks if the number of moves `n` is less than the number of cubes `m`. If `n` is less than `m`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to build a tower with more cubes than moves.

The program then checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even using the bitwise AND operator `&` and the modulo operator `%`. If both numbers have the same parity (i.e., both are odd or both are even), it prints 'YES' because it's possible to build a tower with the given number of cubes after the given number of moves.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
