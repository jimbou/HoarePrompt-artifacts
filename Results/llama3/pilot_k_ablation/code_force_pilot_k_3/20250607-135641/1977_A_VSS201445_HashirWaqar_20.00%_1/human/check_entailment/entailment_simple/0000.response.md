Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the two integers `n` and `m` and checks if `n` is less than `m`. If this condition is true, it prints 'NO' because Nikita cannot obtain a tower with `m` cubes in `n` moves if `n` is less than `m`.
3. If `n` is not less than `m`, the program checks if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even. This is done using the bitwise AND operator `&` and the modulo operator `%`. If both `n` and `m` are odd, `n & 1` and `m & 1` will both be 1, and if both are even, `n % 2` and `m % 2` will both be 0. If this condition is true, it prints 'YES' because Nikita can obtain a tower with `m` cubes in `n` moves.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
