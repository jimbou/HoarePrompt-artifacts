Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly determines whether it is possible to have a tower with exactly m cubes after n moves by Nikita. It checks if n is less than m, in which case it is not possible to have m cubes, and prints 'NO'. If n is greater than or equal to m, it checks if both n and m are odd or both even. If they are, it prints 'YES', indicating that it is possible to have a tower with m cubes. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
