Reasoning:

The problem requires determining whether it's possible to end up with a tower of exactly m cubes after n moves, where in each move, Nikita either adds or removes one cube from the top of the tower.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by iterating over each test case and checking two conditions:

1. If n is less than m, it prints 'NO', which is incorrect. The correct condition should be if n is less than or equal to m and (n - m) is odd, then it's impossible to end up with m cubes.

2. If n and m are both odd or both even, it prints 'YES'. This is correct because if n and m have the same parity (both odd or both even), it's possible to end up with m cubes after n moves.

However, the program is missing the case where n is greater than m and (n - m) is even. In this case, it's also possible to end up with m cubes after n moves.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
