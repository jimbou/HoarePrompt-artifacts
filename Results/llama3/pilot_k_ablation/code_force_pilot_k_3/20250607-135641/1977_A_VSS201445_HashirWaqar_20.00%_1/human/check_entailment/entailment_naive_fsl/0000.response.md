Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly determines whether it is possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. The key insight is that the number of cubes in the tower after n moves must be either even or odd, depending on whether n is even or odd. If n is even, the number of cubes in the tower must be even, and if n is odd, the number of cubes in the tower must be odd.

The program checks this condition using the bitwise AND operator (&). If n and m are both odd or both even, the program prints "YES", indicating that it is possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program also correctly handles the case where n is less than m, in which case it is not possible to have a tower with m cubes after n moves, and prints "NO".

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
