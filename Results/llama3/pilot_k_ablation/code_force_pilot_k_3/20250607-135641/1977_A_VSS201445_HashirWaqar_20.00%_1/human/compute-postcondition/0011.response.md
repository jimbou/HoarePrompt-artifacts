The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and `stdin`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `stdin`. If `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `stdin` contains an integer `t-1` (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). So for the loop to be executed one more time the `stdin` must contain an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).
State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100)**
