Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100)**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `m` have been updated to the first pair of integers from the input, and the stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). The values of `n` and `m` are between 1 and 100, as specified in the initial state.
