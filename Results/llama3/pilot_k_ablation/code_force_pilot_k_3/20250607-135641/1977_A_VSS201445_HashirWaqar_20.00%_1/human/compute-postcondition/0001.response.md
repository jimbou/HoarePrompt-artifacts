The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` accepts two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). The first line of the input is read and split into two integers, which are assigned to `n` and `m`. The remaining input lines are still in the stdin.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer `t-1` (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100).**
