Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin contains an integer `t-1` (0 <= t-1 <= 99) followed by `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `m` (1 <= n, m <= 100). If `n` is less than `m`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is larger than or equal to `m`, then if both `n` and `m` are either both odd or both even, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
