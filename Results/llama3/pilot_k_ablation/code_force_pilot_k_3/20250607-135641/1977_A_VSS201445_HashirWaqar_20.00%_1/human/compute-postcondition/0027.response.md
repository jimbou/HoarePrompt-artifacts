Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers between 1 and 100, stdin is empty. If `n` is less than `m`, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, if both `n` and `m` are odd or both are even, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input stream (stdin) is empty, and the program has printed 'NO' for each pair of integers (n, m) where n is less than m, and 'YES' for each pair where n is not less than m and both n and m are either both odd or both even.
