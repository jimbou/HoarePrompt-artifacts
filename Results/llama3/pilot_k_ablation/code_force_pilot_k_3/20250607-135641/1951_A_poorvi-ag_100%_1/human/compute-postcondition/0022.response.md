Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones` and now it has one more 'yes' appended to it, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, except for the `results` list, which now has an additional 'yes' appended to it. The stdin remains empty.
