Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer equal to 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains no input, '11' is not in `arr`.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'yes'. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true in the initial state are still true.
