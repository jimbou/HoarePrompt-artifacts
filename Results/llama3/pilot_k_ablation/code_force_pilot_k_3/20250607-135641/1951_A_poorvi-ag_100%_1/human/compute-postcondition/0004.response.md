Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains no input**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `results` has been updated to include the string 'yes'. All other variables remain unchanged, with `start` and `end` being integers, `t` being a positive integer, `n` being an integer, `arr` being a string, `count_ones` being 0, and `_` being 0. There is still no input in stdin.
