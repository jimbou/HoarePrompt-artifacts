To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` needs to remain greater than 1.

Since `_` is incremented by 1, its new value will be 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The states of other variables (`start`, `end`, `n`, `arr`, `count_ones`, and `results`) are not affected by the loop head and remain the same.

State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` has one more 'yes' appended to it. If `count_ones` is not 0, then if `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains 'no' at the end. If `count_ones` is even, `results` contains 'no' at the end if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains 'yes' at the end. stdin is empty.**
