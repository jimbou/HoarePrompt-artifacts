The code appends 'yes' to the results list. The values of the other variables are not affected. The results list now contains either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of count_ones, and also contains an additional 'yes' at the end.

Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones` and also contains an additional 'yes' at the end, stdin is empty.**
