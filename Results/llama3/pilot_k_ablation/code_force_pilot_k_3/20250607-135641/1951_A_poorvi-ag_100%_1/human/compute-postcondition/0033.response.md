Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones` and an additional 'yes' at the end. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` has one more 'yes' appended to it. If `count_ones` is not 0, then if `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains 'no' at the end. If `count_ones` is even, `results` contains 'no' at the end if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains 'yes' at the end and an additional 'yes' at the end. stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but the `results` list has an additional 'yes' appended to it, regardless of the value of `count_ones`. The conditions for 'yes' or 'no' at the end of `results` based on `count_ones` still apply, but an extra 'yes' is added to the end of the list.
