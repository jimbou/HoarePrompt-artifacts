Postcondition: ***`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones`. If `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains 'no' at the end. If `count_ones` is even, `results` contains 'no' at the end if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains 'yes' at the end. stdin is empty.***
