Postcondition: ***`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer, and `_` is 0. If `count_ones` is odd, then `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, then if `count_ones` is 2, `results` is a list containing 'no' if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'yes'. If `count_ones` is greater than 2, then `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'.***
