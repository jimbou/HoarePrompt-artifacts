Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones` and an additional 'yes' appended to it, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `count_ones` is still an integer, but its specific value is not changed by the code. The list `results` now contains an additional 'yes' appended to it, regardless of the previous value of `count_ones`. The stdin remains empty.
