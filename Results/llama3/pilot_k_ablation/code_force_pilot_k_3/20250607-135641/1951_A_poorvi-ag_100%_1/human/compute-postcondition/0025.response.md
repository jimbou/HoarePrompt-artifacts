Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones`, and now it has an additional 'yes' at the end, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but the `results` list has been appended with an additional 'yes' element.
