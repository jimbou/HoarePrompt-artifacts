Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an odd integer not equal to 0, and `_` is 0.**

The code appends the string 'no' to the `results` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains the string 'no'. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
