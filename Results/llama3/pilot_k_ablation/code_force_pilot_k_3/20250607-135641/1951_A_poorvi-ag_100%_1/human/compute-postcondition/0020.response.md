The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, and `_` is 1. If `count_ones` is 0, then `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'. If `count_ones` is odd, then `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, then if `count_ones` is 2, `results` is a list containing 'no' if '11' is in `arr`, otherwise `results` is a list containing 'yes'. If `count_ones` is greater than 2, then `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'.**
