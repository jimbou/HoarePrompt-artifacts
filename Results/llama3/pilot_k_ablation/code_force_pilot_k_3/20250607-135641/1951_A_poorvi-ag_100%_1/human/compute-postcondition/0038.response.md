Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` has two more 'yes' appended to it. If `count_ones` is not 0, then if `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains 'no' at the end. If `count_ones` is even, `results` contains 'no' at the end if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains 'yes' at the end.**

In this output state, the value of `results` has been updated by appending 'yes' to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `results` is still dependent on the value of `count_ones`, but now it has an additional 'yes' appended to it.
