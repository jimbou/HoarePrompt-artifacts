The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than initially does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than initially, _ is 0**
