Output State: **start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, _ is 2, count_ones is an integer, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of count_ones and 'no' is appended at the end of the list.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values except for the list `results`. The list `results` now contains an additional 'no' at the end, regardless of the value of `count_ones`. The other variables, including `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_`, remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
