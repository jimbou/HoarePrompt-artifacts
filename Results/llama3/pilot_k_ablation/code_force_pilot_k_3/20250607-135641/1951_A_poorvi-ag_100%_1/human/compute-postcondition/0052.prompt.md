Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones` for each iteration of the loop. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` has `t` 'yes' appended to it. If `count_ones` is not 0, then if `count_ones` is odd, `results` contains `t` 'no's. If `count_ones` is even, `results` contains 'no' if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, otherwise `results` contains 'yes'. stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 1 element, `r` is the first element in the list, stdin is empty, and the first element in the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 2 elements, `r` is the second element in the list, stdin is empty, and the second element in the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed, and 'yes' or 'no' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' that must have at least 3 elements, `r` is the third element in the list, stdin is empty, and the third element in the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed, and 'yes' or 'no' is printed, and the third element in the list `results` which is either 'yes' or 'no' is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
