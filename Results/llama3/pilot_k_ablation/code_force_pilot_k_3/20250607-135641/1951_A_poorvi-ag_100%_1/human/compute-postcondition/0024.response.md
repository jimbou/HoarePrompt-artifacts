Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones` and also contains 'no' at the end, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `count_ones` is still an integer. The list `results` now contains 'no' at the end, in addition to its previous values which depend on the value of `count_ones`. The stdin remains empty.
