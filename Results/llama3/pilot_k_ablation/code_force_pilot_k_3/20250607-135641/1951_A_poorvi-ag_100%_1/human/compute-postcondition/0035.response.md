Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of `count_ones`. If `count_ones` is 0, results has one more 'yes' appended to it. If `count_ones` is not 0, then if `count_ones` is odd, results contains 'no' at the end. If `count_ones` is even, results contains 'no' at the end if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, otherwise results contains 'yes' at the end. However, results now contains 'no' at the end regardless of the previous conditions.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `count_ones` is still an integer, but its value does not affect the last element of `results` anymore. The list `results` now definitely contains 'no' at the end, regardless of the value of `count_ones` or the presence of '11' in `arr`.
