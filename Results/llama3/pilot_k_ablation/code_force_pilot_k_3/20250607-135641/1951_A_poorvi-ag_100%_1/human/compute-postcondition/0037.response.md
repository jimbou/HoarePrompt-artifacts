Postcondition: ***start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, _ is 2, count_ones is an integer, results is a list containing either 'yes' or 'no' depending on the value of count_ones. If '11' is in arr, results contains 'no' at the end. If '11' is not in arr, if count_ones is 0, results has one more 'yes' appended to it. If count_ones is not 0, then if count_ones is odd, results contains 'no' at the end. If count_ones is even, results contains 'no' at the end if count_ones is 2, otherwise results contains 'yes' at the end.***
