This function reads a series of binary strings from standard input, determines whether each string can be transformed into a string of alternating 1s and 0s by swapping two characters, and prints 'yes' if possible and 'no' otherwise. The function processes multiple test cases, where the number of test cases is provided as input, and each test case consists of a binary string. The function's output is a series of 'yes' or 'no' responses, one for each test case, indicating whether the corresponding binary string can be transformed into a string of alternating 1s and 0s.
