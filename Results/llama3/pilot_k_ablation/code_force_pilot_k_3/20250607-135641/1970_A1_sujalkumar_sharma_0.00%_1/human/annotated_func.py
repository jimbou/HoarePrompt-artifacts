    #The program returns a string consisting of characters from a non-empty string s, where s consists only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, in a specific order.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a non-empty string of balanced parentheses as input and returns a rearranged string consisting of the same characters in a specific order, determined by sorting the characters based on their balance and position in the original string.
