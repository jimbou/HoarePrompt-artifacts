Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (balance, i, char), `balance` is 0, `i` is `n-1`, and `char` is the last character of `s`.**

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the list `positions` now contains a tuple for each character in the string `s`, reflecting the balance and character at each position, the index `i` has reached the last character of the string, and the balance has returned to 0, indicating that the parentheses sequence is balanced.
