Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of s, balance is -1, positions is an empty list, index is 0, char is the first character in the string s and char is not equal to "("**

In this output state, the value of `balance` has been updated to -1, as the code `balance -= 1` decrements the value of `balance` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
