Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, positions is a list containing a tuple of the form (balance, i, char), index is 0, and balance is either 2 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", or 0 if the first character is not "(", `i` is 1, and `char` is the second character of `s`.**

The value of balance is increased by 1. Since the first character in the string `s` is either "(" or ")", the value of balance is either 1 or -1. After increasing by 1, the value of balance is either 2 or 0. The values of the other variables are not affected.
