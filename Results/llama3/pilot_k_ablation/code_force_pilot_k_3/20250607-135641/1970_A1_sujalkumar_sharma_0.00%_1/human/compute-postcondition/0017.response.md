Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing tuples reflecting the balance and characters processed so far, `index` is 0, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is increased by 1 from its previous value. If `char` is ')', `balance` is decreased by 1 from its previous value after processing the first two characters.***
