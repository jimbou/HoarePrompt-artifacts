Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s`, positions is a list containing a tuple (balance, i, char), index is 0, and balance is either 1 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", or -1 if the first character is not "(".

The code appends a tuple to the positions list. The tuple contains the current balance, index, and character. Since the index is 0, the character is the first character in the string `s`. The balance is either 1 if the first character is "(", or -1 if the first character is not "(". The other variables remain unchanged.
