Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s`, positions is a list containing a tuple of the form (balance, i, char), index is 0, and balance is either 1 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", or -1 if the first character is not "(".

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the list `positions` now contains a tuple with the current balance, index, and character, the index is still at 0, and the balance is still either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`.
