Output State: **s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, balance is 0, positions is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is set to the length of `s`, which is a positive integer since `s` is a non-empty string. The value of `balance` is initialized to 0, and the value of `positions` is an empty list, as it is not populated by the code.
