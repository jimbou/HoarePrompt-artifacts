Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, positions is a list containing two tuples of the form (balance, i, char), index is 0, and balance is either 2 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", and the second character is also "(", or 0 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", and the second character is not "(", or -2 if the first character in the string `s` is not "(", and the second character is "(", and `i` is 1, and `char` is the second character of `s`, and the second tuple in positions is (balance, 1, char).**

In this output state, the list `positions` now contains two tuples. The first tuple is the same as before, with `balance` being either 2, 0, or -2, `i` being 1, and `char` being the second character of `s`. The second tuple is a new addition, with the same values for `balance`, `i`, and `char`. The other variables, `s`, `n`, and `index`, remain unchanged.
