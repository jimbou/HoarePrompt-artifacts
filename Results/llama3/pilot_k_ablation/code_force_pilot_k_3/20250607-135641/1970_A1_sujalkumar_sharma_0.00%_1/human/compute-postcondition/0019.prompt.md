Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: s is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence, n is the length of s, balance is 0, positions is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i, char in enumerate(s):
    if char == '(':
        balance += 1
    else:
        balance -= 1
    positions.append((balance, i, char))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 1 character, `n` is the length of `s`, positions is a list containing a tuple of the form (balance, i, char), index is 0, and balance is either 1 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", or -1 if the first character is not "(".

In natural language, the output state is that the string `s` remains unchanged, the length of `s` is still stored in `n`, the list `positions` now contains a tuple with the current balance, index, and character, the index is still at 0, and the balance is still either 1 or -1 depending on the first character of `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 2 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, positions is a list containing two tuples of the form (balance, i, char), index is 0, and balance is either 2 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", and the second character is also "(", or 0 if the first character in the string `s` is "(", and the second character is not "(", or -2 if the first character in the string `s` is not "(", and the second character is "(", and `i` is 1, and `char` is the second character of `s`, and the second tuple in positions is (balance, 1, char).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of characters "(" and ")" and is a balanced parentheses sequence that must have at least 3 characters, `n` is the length of `s`, `positions` is a list containing tuples reflecting the balance and characters processed so far and now also includes the tuple `(balance, i, char)`, `index` is 0, `i` is 2, and `char` is the third character of `s`. If `char` is '(', `balance` is increased by 1 from its previous value. If `char` is ')', `balance` is decreased by 1 from its previous value after processing the first two characters.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
