Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to implement the balanced shuffle operation on a given balanced parentheses sequence. This involves computing the balance of each prefix of the sequence, sorting the characters based on this balance and their positions, and then forming a new sequence from the sorted characters.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the balanced shuffle of `s`.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program first initializes an empty list `positions` to store tuples containing the balance of each prefix, the position of the character in the input sequence, and the character itself.

4. The program then iterates over each character in the input string `s`. For each character, it updates the balance by incrementing it if the character is an opening parenthesis and decrementing it if the character is a closing parenthesis. It then appends a tuple containing the current balance, position, and character to the `positions` list.

5. After iterating over all characters, the program sorts the `positions` list based on the balance (in ascending order) and the position (in descending order) using the `sort` method with a custom sorting key.

6. Finally, the program constructs the balanced shuffle by joining the characters from the sorted `positions` list and returns the result.

7. The main part of the program reads a string from the input, strips any leading or trailing whitespace, and prints the result of calling `func_1` with the input string.

Based on the provided problem description and the implementation details, the given Python program correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation and produces the expected output for a given balanced parentheses sequence.

Correctness: **True**
