Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the balanced shuffle operation as described in the problem statement. The program first calculates the balance of each prefix of the input sequence and stores it along with the position and character in a list of tuples. Then, it sorts this list based on the balance and position, and finally, it constructs the result string by joining the characters in the sorted order.

The program correctly handles the case where the input sequence is a non-empty balanced parentheses sequence with a length not exceeding 500,000. The use of the `enumerate` function to iterate over the input string and the `sort` method with a custom sorting key ensures that the program runs efficiently.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program produces the correct output for the given example input.

Correctness: **True**
