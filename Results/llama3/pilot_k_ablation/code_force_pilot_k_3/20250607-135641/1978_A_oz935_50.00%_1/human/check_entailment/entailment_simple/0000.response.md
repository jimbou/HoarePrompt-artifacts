Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the number of books `n` and the list of book pages `ls`.
3. It removes the last book page from the list `ls` and stores it in the variable `last`. This is the highest number of pages in one of the piles.
4. It sorts the remaining book pages in descending order and removes the highest number of pages from the sorted list, storing it in the variable `other`. This is the highest number of pages in the other pile.
5. It prints the sum of `last` and `other`, which is the maximum total number of pages Alice can read by dividing the books into two piles.

The program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for the given example inputs.

Correctness: **True**
