Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the largest number is not at the end of the list. For example, if the input is:

3
1 3 2

The program will output 5 (3 + 2), but the correct output should be 4 (3 + 1). The program assumes that the largest number is always at the end of the list, which is not necessarily true.

The program should sort the list in descending order and then add the first two numbers to get the correct result. The correct code should be:

def func():
    t = int(input().strip())
    for i in range(t):
        n = int(input().strip())
        ls = list(map(int, input().split()))
        ls.sort(reverse=True)
        print(ls[0] + ls[1])
