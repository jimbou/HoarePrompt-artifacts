This function reads input from stdin, processes it, and prints output. It accepts no parameters and returns no value. It reads an integer t, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer n and n integers. It then prints the sum of the last integer and the second-largest integer in the list. The function modifies the state of stdin by consuming all input and leaves it empty. The function's purpose is to solve a specific problem by processing input and producing output based on that input.
