To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 500, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, `i` is 0, stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9)**
