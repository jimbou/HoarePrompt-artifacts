Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n-2 integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n-2 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer between 2 and 100, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**

The code first reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 2 and 100. Then, it reads `n` integers from stdin, stores them in a list `ls`, and removes the last integer from the list, converting it to an integer and assigning it to `last`. The list `ls` is then sorted, and the last element (which is the second-largest integer) is removed, converted to an integer, and assigned to `other`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `i` is still 0. Stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each with `n-2` integers.
