Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500, i is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n-2 integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n-2 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer between 2 and 100, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is being printed, which is an integer between 2 and 2*10^9.**

Here is a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 500. The value of `i` also remains unchanged, still 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by 1, now containing `t-5` test cases. Each test case still consists of an integer `n` between 2 and 100, followed by `n-2` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, …, `a_n-2` between 1 and 10^9. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 100, which was read from the input. The value of `last` is now an integer between 1 and 10^9, which was the last element of the list `ls`. The value of `other` is now an integer between 1 and 10^9, which was the maximum element of the list `ls` excluding the last element. The sum of `last` and `other` is being printed, which is an integer between 2 and 2*10^9.
