Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500, i is t-1, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 2 and 100, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is being printed, which is an integer between 2 and 2*10^9.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases have been processed. The variables `n`, `last`, and `other` will hold the values from the last test case, and the sum of `last` and `other` will be printed, which will be an integer between 2 and 2*10^9.
