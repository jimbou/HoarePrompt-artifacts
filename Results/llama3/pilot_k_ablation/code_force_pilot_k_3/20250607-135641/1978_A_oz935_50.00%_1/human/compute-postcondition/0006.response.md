Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500, i is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, each consisting of an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) followed by n-2 integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n-2 (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9), n is an integer between 2 and 100, last is an integer between 1 and 10^9, other is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the sum of last and other is being printed**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which is now an integer between 2 and 100. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, splits them into individual integers, and assigns them to `ls`. The third line removes the last integer from `ls` and assigns it to `last`, which is now an integer between 1 and 10^9. The fourth line sorts the remaining integers in `ls` in ascending order, removes the last integer, and assigns it to `other`, which is now an integer between 1 and 10^9. The sum of `last` and `other` is being printed. The value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains `t-3` test cases.
