The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `a` is equal to its original value plus 1 if the character at index i in `s` is greater than the character at index i in `t`, otherwise it remains the same, `b` is equal to its original value plus 1 if the character at index i in `s` is less than the character at index i in `t`, otherwise it remains the same, `i` is 2**
