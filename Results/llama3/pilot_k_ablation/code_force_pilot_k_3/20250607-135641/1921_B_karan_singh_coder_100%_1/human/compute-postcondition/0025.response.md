Output State: **n is greater than 0, s is a string, t is a string, a is equal to its original value plus 1 if the character at index i in s is greater than the character at index i in t, otherwise it remains the same, b is equal to its original value plus 1 if the character at index i in s is less than the character at index i in t, otherwise it remains the same, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: n, s, t, and the maximum of a and b is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated based on the comparison of the characters at index `i` in strings `s` and `t`. The value of `a` is incremented by 1 if the character in `s` is greater than the character in `t`, and the value of `b` is incremented by 1 if the character in `s` is less than the character in `t`. The other variables remain unchanged.
