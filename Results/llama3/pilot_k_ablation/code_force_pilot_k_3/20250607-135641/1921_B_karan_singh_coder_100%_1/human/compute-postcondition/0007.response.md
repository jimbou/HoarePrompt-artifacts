Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, s is a string, t is a string, a is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t, plus whether the character in s at position i is greater than the character in t at position i, b is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t, plus whether the character in s at position i is less than the character in t at position i, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: n, s, t**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the comparison of characters at position `i` in strings `s` and `t`. If the character in `s` at position `i` is greater than the character in `t` at position `i`, `a` is incremented by 1. If the character in `s` at position `i` is less than the character in `t` at position `i`, `b` is incremented by 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: `n`, `s`, `t`.
