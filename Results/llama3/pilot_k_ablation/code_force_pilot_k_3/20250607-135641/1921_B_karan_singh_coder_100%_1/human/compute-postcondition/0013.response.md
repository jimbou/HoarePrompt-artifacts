To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: `n`, `s`, `t`**
