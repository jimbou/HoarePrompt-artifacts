The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer, s is a string, t is a string, a is 0, b is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: n, s, t does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: `n`, `s`, `t`, `i` is 0**
