Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, s is a string, t is a string, a is 0 plus the number of positions where s is lexicographically greater than t plus whether s is lexicographically greater than t at position i, b is 0 plus the number of positions where s is lexicographically less than t plus whether s is lexicographically less than t at position i, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: n, s, t**

The code increments the value of `a` by 1 if the character at position `i` in string `s` is lexicographically greater than the character at the same position in string `t`, and increments the value of `b` by 1 if the character at position `i` in string `s` is lexicographically less than the character at the same position in string `t`. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The values of `n`, `s`, and `t` are not modified by the code. Stdin remains unchanged as no input operations are performed.
