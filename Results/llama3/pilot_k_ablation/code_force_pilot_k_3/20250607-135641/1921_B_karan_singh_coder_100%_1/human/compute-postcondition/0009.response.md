The code prints the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Where `a` is the number of positions where the character in string `s` is greater than the character in string `t`, and `b` is the number of positions where the character in string `s` is less than the character in string `t`.

Output: **max(a, b) (where a is the number of positions where the character in string s is greater than the character in string t, and b is the number of positions where the character in string s is less than the character in string t)**
