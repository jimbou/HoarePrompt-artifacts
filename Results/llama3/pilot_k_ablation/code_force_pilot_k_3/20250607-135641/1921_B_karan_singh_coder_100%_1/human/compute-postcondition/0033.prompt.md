Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5). The second line contains a string s of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there is a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The third line contains a string f of n characters, where the i-th character is '1' if there should be a cat in the i-th box and '0' otherwise. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    t = input()
    a = b = 0
    for i in range(n):
        a += s[i] > t[i]
        b += s[i] < t[i]
    print(max(a, b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is a string, t is a string, a is the number of positions where the character in s is greater than the character in t, b is the number of positions where the character in s is less than the character in t, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: n, s, t, and the maximum of a and b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s is a string, t is a string, a is the number of positions where s is lexicographically greater than t, b is the number of positions where s is lexicographically less than t, i is n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: n, s, t, and the maximum of a and b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is greater than or equal to 0, s is a string, t is a string, a is equal to its original value plus the number of times the character at index i in s is greater than the character at index i in t, b is equal to its original value plus the number of times the character at index i in s is less than the character at index i in t, i is equal to n, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: n, s, t, and the maximum of a and b is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
