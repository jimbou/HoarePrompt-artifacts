Output State: **n is an integer, s is a string, t is a string, a is 0, b is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: n, s, t**

The code reads three lines of input from stdin: an integer `n`, a string `s`, and a string `t`. The values of `n`, `s`, and `t` are assigned to their respective variables. The variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 0. The code does not modify the value of `_`, which remains 0. The code does not affect the number of test cases in stdin, but it consumes three inputs, leaving multiple test cases minus 3 inputs in stdin.
