The code prints the maximum of `a` and `b`, where `a` is the number of times the character at index `i` in string `s` is greater than the character at index `i` in string `t`, and `b` is the number of times the character at index `i` in string `s` is less than the character at index `i` in string `t`. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, which is greater than or equal to 0.

Output: **the maximum of the number of times the character at index i in s is greater than the character at index i in t and the number of times the character at index i in s is less than the character at index i in t**
