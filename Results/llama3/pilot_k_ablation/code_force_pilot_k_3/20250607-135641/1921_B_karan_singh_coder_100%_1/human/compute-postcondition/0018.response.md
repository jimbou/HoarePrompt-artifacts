Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, s is a string, t is a string, a is 0 plus the number of positions where s is lexicographically greater than t plus whether s is lexicographically greater than t at position i plus whether s is lexicographically greater than t at position 2, b is 0 plus the number of positions where s is lexicographically less than t plus whether s is lexicographically less than t at position i plus whether s is lexicographically less than t at position 2, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: n, s, t**

The code increments the value of `a` by 1 if the character at position `i` (which is 2) in string `s` is lexicographically greater than the character at the same position in string `t`. Similarly, it increments the value of `b` by 1 if the character at position `i` (which is 2) in string `s` is lexicographically less than the character at the same position in string `t`. The values of `n`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: `n`, `s`, `t`.
