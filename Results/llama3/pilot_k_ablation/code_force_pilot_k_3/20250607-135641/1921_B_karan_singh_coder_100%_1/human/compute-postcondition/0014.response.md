Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, s is a string, t is a string, a is 0 plus the number of positions where s is lexicographically greater than t, b is 0 plus the number of positions where s is lexicographically less than t, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: n, s, t**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `s`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are incremented based on the comparison of characters at the current position `i` in strings `s` and `t`. The number of positions where `s` is lexicographically greater than `t` is added to `a`, and the number of positions where `s` is lexicographically less than `t` is added to `b`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: `n`, `s`, `t`.
