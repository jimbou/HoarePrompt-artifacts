The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input is at least 1, _ is 0**
