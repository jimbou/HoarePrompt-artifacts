The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `a` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in `s` is greater than the character in `t`, `b` is 0 plus the number of positions where the character in `s` is less than the character in `t`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: `n`, `s`, `t`**
