This function takes a list of distinct integers p as input, where each integer is between 1 and 100, and returns a list of 101 integers representing the remaining players after a process. The function initializes a list of 101 integers, remaining_players, and iterates over the range from 1 to 100. For each number n in this range, it calculates the number of players remaining by subtracting the count of players in p that are greater than or equal to n, and stores this value in remaining_players[n]. The function returns the list remaining_players, where each integer represents the number of remaining players for the corresponding number n.
