Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the game logic described in the problem statement. The `func_1` function precomputes the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players, and the `func_2` function uses this precomputed information to answer the queries.

The key insight is that the number of remaining players only depends on the minimum value in the sequence `p`, because the game continues until no players are kicked out in a round. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is used to efficiently count the number of players that are kicked out in each round.

The program handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the initial number of players is 1 or equal to the minimum value in the sequence `p`. The precomputation approach ensures that the program can handle a large number of queries efficiently.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it accurately implements the game logic described in the problem statement.
