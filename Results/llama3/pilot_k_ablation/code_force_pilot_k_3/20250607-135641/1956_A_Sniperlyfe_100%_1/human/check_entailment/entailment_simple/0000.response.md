Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly implements the game logic. In each round, it finds the players to be kicked out by using the `bisect.bisect_right` function to count the number of players to be kicked out. It then updates the number of remaining players accordingly.

2. The program correctly handles the case where there are fewer players than the indices in the sequence `a`. In such cases, it simply skips those indices.

3. The program correctly generates the output for each test case. It uses the `remaining_players` list to get the number of remaining players for each query `n` and appends the result to the `results` list.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the sequence `a` contains indices greater than 100. In such cases, the `remaining_players` list will contain zeros for those indices, which is correct because there are no players to be kicked out.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the input is empty. In such cases, the `results` list will be empty, which is correct because there are no test cases to process.

6. The program correctly handles the case where the input contains invalid data. In such cases, the program will raise an exception, which is correct because the input is invalid.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
