Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first defines a function `func_1(p)` that takes a list of integers `p` as input. This function calculates the number of remaining players for each possible initial number of players from 1 to 100. It uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the number of players that would be kicked out in each round.

2. The function `func_1(p)` initializes a list `remaining_players` of size 101 (to accommodate players from 0 to 100) with all elements set to 0. It then iterates over each possible initial number of players `n` from 1 to 100.

3. For each `n`, it enters a while loop that continues until no more players are kicked out. In each iteration of the loop, it calculates the number of players that would be kicked out in the current round by finding the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to the current number of players `cur_n`. This is done using the `bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)` function, which returns the insertion point for `cur_n` in `p` to maintain sorted order.

4. The number of players kicked out is subtracted from `cur_n`, and the loop continues until `cur_n` is less than the minimum value in `p`. At this point, no more players can be kicked out, and the remaining players are stored in `remaining_players[n]`.

5. The function `func_2()` reads the input, calls `func_1(p)` to calculate the remaining players for each possible initial number of players, and then uses this information to answer the queries.

6. For each query `n`, it simply looks up the corresponding value in `remaining_players` and appends it to the result list.

7. Finally, the program prints the results for each test case.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
