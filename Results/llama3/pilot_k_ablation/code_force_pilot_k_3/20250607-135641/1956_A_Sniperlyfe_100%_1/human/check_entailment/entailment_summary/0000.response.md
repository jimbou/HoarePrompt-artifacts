Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of players declared as winners in a game based on a sequence of integers a and a list of queries n. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2.

func_1 takes a list of distinct integers p as input and returns a list of 101 integers representing the remaining players after a process. This function correctly calculates the number of remaining players for each number n from 1 to 100 by subtracting the count of players in p that are greater than or equal to n.

func_2 takes a sequence of integers as input, processes it, and returns a list of strings. The input sequence is sorted in ascending order, and the function performs some operations on it, resulting in a new list of integers called 'remaining_players'. The function then uses this list to generate a list of strings, where each string is a subset of 'remaining_players' based on the input queries 'qs'.

The program correctly meets the problem description by using func_1 to calculate the remaining players for each number n and then using func_2 to generate the output strings based on the input queries.

Correctness: **True**
