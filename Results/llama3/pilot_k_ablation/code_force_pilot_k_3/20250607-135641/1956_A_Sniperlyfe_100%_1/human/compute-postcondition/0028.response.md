Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 1 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is greater than or equal to 1 and less than its original value by the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to the original value of cur_n**

In this output state, the value of `cur_n` has been updated by subtracting the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to its original value. This is because the `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the insertion point for `cur_n` in `p` to maintain sorted order, which effectively counts the number of elements in `p` less than or equal to `cur_n`. The `count` variable now holds this value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
