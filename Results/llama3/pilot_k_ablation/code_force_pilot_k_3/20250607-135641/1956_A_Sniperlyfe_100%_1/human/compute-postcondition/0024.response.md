Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 3 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is less than or equal to 0, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros**

The code snippet modifies the value of `cur_n` by subtracting the count of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` (which is 3). The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the insertion point for `cur_n` in `p` to maintain sorted order. Since `p` contains distinct integers and `min(p)` is less than or equal to 3, the count of elements less than or equal to 3 can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. Subtracting this count from `cur_n` (which is 3) results in a value less than or equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
