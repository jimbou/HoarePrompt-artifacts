To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `cur_n` and `p` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is 2 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 2, and `min(p)` is 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `p` so that `min(p)` is still 1, and the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 2 is not more than 1 (so that `cur_n` is at least 1).

State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, and p has at most one element less than or equal to 2, max_n is greater than 1, n is 2, cur_n is 1, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros.**
