Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, max_n is greater than 0, n is 1, cur_n is 0, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_players` has been updated to reflect the assignment of `cur_n` to `remaining_players[n]`. The value of `cur_n` is 0, so `remaining_players[1]` is now 0. The rest of the elements in `remaining_players` remain unchanged, as they were initially zeros. The other variables, `p`, `max_n`, `n`, and `cur_n`, retain their original values and properties.
