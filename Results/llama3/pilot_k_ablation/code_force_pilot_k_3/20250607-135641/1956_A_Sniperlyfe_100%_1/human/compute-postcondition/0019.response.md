Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is greater than 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, and p has no elements less than or equal to 1, max_n is greater than 1, n is 2, cur_n is 1, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the list `p` has been modified such that all elements less than or equal to 1 have been removed, and the variable `cur_n` has been decremented by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to 1. The other variables, `max_n`, `n`, and `remaining_players`, remain unchanged.
