According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cur_n` and `p`. If `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is less than or equal to 0 and `min(p)` is less than or equal to 3. `cur_n` being less than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 1. `min(p)` being less than or equal to 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `min(p)` is less than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 1 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is greater than or equal to 1, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros**
