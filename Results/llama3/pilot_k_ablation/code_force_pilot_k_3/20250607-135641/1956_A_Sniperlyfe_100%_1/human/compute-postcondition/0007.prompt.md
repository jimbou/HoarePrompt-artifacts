Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains one less input than before.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    k, q = map(int, input().split())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    qs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    remaining_players = func_1(p)
    res = [remaining_players[n] for n in qs]
    results.append(' '.join(map(str, res)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is a list containing one string, qs is a list of integers, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, stdin is empty, _ is 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is a list containing two strings, qs is a list of integers, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, stdin is empty, _ is 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is a list containing three strings, qs is a list of integers, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, stdin is empty, _ is 2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
