Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, `max_n` is greater than 1, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 2, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros.**

In this output state, the value of `cur_n` has been updated to 2, which is the current value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
