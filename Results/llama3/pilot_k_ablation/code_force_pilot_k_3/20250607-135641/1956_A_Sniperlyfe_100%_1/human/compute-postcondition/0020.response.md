Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is greater than 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, and p has no elements less than or equal to 1, max_n is greater than 1, n is 2, cur_n is 1, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_players[n]` has been updated to `cur_n`, which is 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `p` still contains distinct integers with a minimum value greater than 1 and a maximum value between 1 and 100, and it does not contain any elements less than or equal to 1. The value of `max_n` is still greater than 1, and `n` is still 2. The value of `cur_n` is still 1. The list `remaining_players` has been updated such that `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1, and the rest of the elements are zeros.
