Output State: **p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is a list containing two strings, qs is a list of integers, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, stdin is empty, _ is 1**

The code block executes as follows:

1. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `k` and `q`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not affect any variables.

2. The second line assigns a list of integers from `stdin` to `p`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not affect any variables.

3. The third line assigns a list of integers from `stdin` to `qs`. Since `stdin` is empty, this line does not affect any variables.

4. The fourth line assigns the result of the function `func_1(p)` to `remaining_players`. Since `p` is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, `remaining_players` is also a list of integers.

5. The fifth line assigns a list of integers to `res` by iterating over `qs` and selecting elements from `remaining_players` at the corresponding indices. Since `qs` is a list of integers, `res` is also a list of integers.

6. The sixth line appends a string to `results` by joining the elements of `res` with spaces. Since `results` is a list containing one string, it now contains two strings.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

* `p` is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order.
* `t` is an integer that must be greater than 0.
* `results` is a list containing two strings.
* `qs` is a list of integers.
* `k` is an integer.
* `q` is an integer.
* `remaining_players` is a list of integers.
* `res` is a list of integers.
* `stdin` is empty.
* `_` is 1.
