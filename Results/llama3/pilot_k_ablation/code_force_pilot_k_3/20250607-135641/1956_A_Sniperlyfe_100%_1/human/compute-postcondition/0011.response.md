The only variable in the loop head is variable `n` and `max_n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `max_n`. If `n` is less than `max_n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, `max_n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be increased by 1 and `max_n` must be greater than 1.
State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, max_n is greater than 1, n is 2, cur_n is 0, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros.**
