To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `cur_n` and `p`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, and `min(p)` is 1.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `cur_n` to be greater than or equal to `min(p)`, which is 1. Since `cur_n` is 1 minus the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n`, we need to adjust the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to `cur_n` to be 0.

This means that `p` should not have any elements less than or equal to `cur_n`, which is 1. Since `p` has at most one element less than or equal to 2, we can adjust `p` to have no elements less than or equal to 1.

The other variables, `max_n`, `n`, and `remaining_players`, do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is greater than 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, and p has no elements less than or equal to 1, `max_n` is greater than 1, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 1, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1] is 0` and the rest are zeros**
