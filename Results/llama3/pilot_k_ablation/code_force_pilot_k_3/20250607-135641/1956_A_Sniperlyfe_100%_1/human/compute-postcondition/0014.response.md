Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, max_n is greater than 1, n is 2, cur_n is 2 minus the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 2, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0 and the rest are zeros.**

The code first uses the bisect.bisect_right function to find the number of elements in the list p that are less than or equal to cur_n (which is 2). This count is then subtracted from cur_n, effectively decreasing cur_n by the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
