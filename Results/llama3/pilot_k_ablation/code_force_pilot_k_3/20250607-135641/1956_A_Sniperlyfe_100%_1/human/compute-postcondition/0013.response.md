To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `p` is a list of distinct integers such that `min(p)` is 1 and `1 <= max(p) <= 100`.
- `max_n` is greater than 1.
- `n` is 2.
- `cur_n` is 2.
- `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros.

The loop condition depends on `cur_n` and `min(p)`. Since `cur_n` is 2 and we know `min(p)` is 1, the condition `cur_n >= min(p)` is already satisfied with the given state. There is no need to adjust any states because the condition for the loop to execute at least once is already met.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, `max_n` is greater than 1, `n` is 2, `cur_n` is 2, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0 and the rest are zeros.**
