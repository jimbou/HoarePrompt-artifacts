Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is greater than or equal to 100 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is 100, n is 101, cur_n is 0, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[n] is 0 for all n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `p` contains only one element, which is 100, and the list `remaining_players` contains all zeros. The variable `n` has reached 101, and `cur_n` is 0.
