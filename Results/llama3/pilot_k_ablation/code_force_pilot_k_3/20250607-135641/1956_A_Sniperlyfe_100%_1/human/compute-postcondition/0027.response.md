To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `cur_n` and `p` since these are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`. At the end of the last iteration, `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than its original value by the number of elements in `p` that are less than or equal to its original value, and `min(p)` is less than or equal to 1.

To guarantee that the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `cur_n` is greater than or equal to `min(p)`. Since `min(p)` is less than or equal to 1, we need to adjust `cur_n` to be greater than or equal to 1.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `min(p)` remains less than or equal to 1, so we don't need to adjust `p` further.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 1 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, `max_n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is greater than or equal to 1, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros**
