The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains one less input than before does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0. 
State: **p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is an empty list, stdin contains one less input than before, _ is 0**
