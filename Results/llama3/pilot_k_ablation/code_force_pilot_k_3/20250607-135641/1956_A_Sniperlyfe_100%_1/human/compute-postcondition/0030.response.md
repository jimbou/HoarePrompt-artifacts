Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 1 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is 0, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1, remaining_players[3] is 0 and the rest are zeros**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_players[n]` has been updated to `cur_n`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `remaining_players` now has the value 0 at index 3, in addition to the previous values at indices 1 and 2.
