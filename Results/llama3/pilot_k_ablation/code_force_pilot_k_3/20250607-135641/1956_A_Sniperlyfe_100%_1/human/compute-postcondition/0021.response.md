To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `n` and `max_n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `n` is less than `max_n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 2, and `max_n` is greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `n` needs to be incremented by 1, so `n` becomes 3. Since `max_n` is greater than 1, it must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `p`, `cur_n`, and `remaining_players`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is greater than 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, and p has no elements less than or equal to 1, `max_n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 1, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros**
