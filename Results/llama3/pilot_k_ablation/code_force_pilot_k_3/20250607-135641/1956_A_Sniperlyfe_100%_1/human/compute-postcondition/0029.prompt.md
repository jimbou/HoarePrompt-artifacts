Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `p` is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is greater than 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, and p has no elements less than or equal to 1, `max_n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros
Code of the loop:
while cur_n >= min(p):
    count = bisect.bisect_right(p, cur_n)
    cur_n -= count


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 3 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is less than or equal to 0, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 1 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is greater than or equal to 1 and less than its original value by the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 1 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is greater than or equal to 1 and less than its original value by the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to its original value, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros, count is the number of elements in p that are less than or equal to the original value of cur_n


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
