Output State: **p is a list of integers representing the sequence a, and it is sorted in ascending order, t is an integer that must be greater than 0, results is a list containing three strings, qs is a list of integers, k is an integer, q is an integer, remaining_players is a list of integers, res is a list of integers, stdin is empty, _ is 2**

The code block modifies the initial state by assigning new values to the variables k, q, p, qs, remaining_players, and res. The first line assigns the integer values of the input to k and q. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to p, which is sorted in ascending order. The third line assigns a list of integers from the input to qs. The fourth line assigns the result of the function func_1(p) to remaining_players. The fifth line assigns a list of integers to res, which is created by selecting elements from remaining_players at the indices specified in qs. The sixth line appends a string representation of res to the results list.

Note that the value of t remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code block. The value of _ also remains unchanged, as it is not used or modified by the code block. The stdin is empty after the execution of the code block, as all the inputs have been consumed.
