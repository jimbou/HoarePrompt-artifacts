Output State: **p is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is less than or equal to 1 and max(p) is less than or equal to 100, max_n is greater than or equal to 3, n is 3, cur_n is 0, remaining_players is a list of 101 integers where remaining_players[1] is 0, remaining_players[2] is 1 and the rest are zeros**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `cur_n` is 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The other variables remain unchanged, with `p` being a list of distinct integers with a minimum value less than or equal to 1 and a maximum value less than or equal to 100, `max_n` being greater than or equal to 3, `n` being 3, and `remaining_players` being a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1, and the rest are zeros.
