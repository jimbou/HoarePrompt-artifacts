To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `cur_n >= min(p)`.

Given the initial states:

- `p` is a list of distinct integers such that `min(p)` is greater than 1 and `1 <= max(p) <= 100`, and `p` has no elements less than or equal to 1.
- `max_n` is greater than or equal to 3.
- `n` is 3.
- `cur_n` is 3.
- `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros.

The loop condition depends on `cur_n` and `min(p)`. Since `cur_n` is 3, we need `min(p)` to be less than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once. However, the given condition for `p` states that `min(p)` is greater than 1, but it does not guarantee that `min(p)` will be less than or equal to 3.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute the first time, we need to adjust the state of `p` so that `min(p)` is less than or equal to 3. This adjustment does not violate any given constraints since `p` can still be a list of distinct integers with `min(p)` greater than 1 and `max(p)` less than or equal to 100.

State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that `min(p)` is less than or equal to 3 and `max(p)` is less than or equal to 100, `max_n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros**
