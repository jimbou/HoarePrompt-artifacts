Output State: **`p` is a list of distinct integers such that min(p) is greater than 1 and 1 <= max(p) <= 100, and p has no elements less than or equal to 1, `max_n` is greater than or equal to 3, `n` is 3, `cur_n` is 3, `remaining_players` is a list of 101 integers where `remaining_players[1]` is 0, `remaining_players[2]` is 1 and the rest are zeros**

In this output state, the value of `cur_n` has been updated to 3, which is the current value of `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
