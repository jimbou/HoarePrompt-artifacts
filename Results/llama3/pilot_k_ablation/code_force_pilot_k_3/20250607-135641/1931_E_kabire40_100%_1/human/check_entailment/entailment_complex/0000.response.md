Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the game strategy described in the problem statement. The key insight is that Anna's optimal strategy is to reverse the numbers with the most trailing zeros, and Sasha's optimal strategy is to concatenate the numbers in a way that maximizes the length of the resulting number.

The program correctly sorts the list of numbers based on the length of the strings after removing trailing zeros, which allows Anna to make the optimal moves. It then concatenates the sorted strings, removing trailing zeros from even-indexed strings, which simulates Sasha's moves.

Finally, the program correctly compares the length of the concatenated string to the maximum power and prints 'Sasha' if the length is greater than or equal to the maximum power plus one, and 'Anna' otherwise. This is because if the length of the concatenated string is greater than or equal to the maximum power plus one, Sasha wins, and otherwise Anna wins.

Correctness: **True**
