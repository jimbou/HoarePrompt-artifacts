Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the game logic. The problem description states that Sasha must extract two elements from the list, concatenate them in any order, and insert the result back into the list. However, the program does not simulate this process correctly. It simply concatenates the reversed numbers in the order they appear in the list, without considering the optimal moves for Sasha.

A counterexample is the input:

3 5
9 56 1

The program will output "Anna", but the correct output should be "Sasha". The optimal moves for Sasha would be to concatenate 9 and 56, resulting in 956, and then concatenate 1 with the remaining number, resulting in 1956, which is greater than 10^5.
