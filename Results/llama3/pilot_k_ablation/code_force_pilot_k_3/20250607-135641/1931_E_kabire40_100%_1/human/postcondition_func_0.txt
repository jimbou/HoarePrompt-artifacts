This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers: the length of a list and a maximum power. The second line contains a list of integers as strings. The function sorts the list based on the length of the strings after removing trailing zeros, then concatenates the sorted strings, removing trailing zeros from even-indexed strings. It compares the length of the concatenated string to the maximum power and prints 'Sasha' if the length is greater than or equal to the maximum power plus one, and 'Anna' otherwise. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.
