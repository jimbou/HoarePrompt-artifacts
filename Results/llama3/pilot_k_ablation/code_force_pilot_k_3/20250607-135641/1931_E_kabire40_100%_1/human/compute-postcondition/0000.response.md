The only variables in the loop head are variable y and the input to the int function. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input to the int function. If the input to the int function is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input to the int function must be at least 1 and y is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases, y is 0, the input to the int function must be at least 1**
