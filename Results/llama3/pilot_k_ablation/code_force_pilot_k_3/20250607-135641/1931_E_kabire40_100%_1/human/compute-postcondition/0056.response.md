To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `list_len`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than `list_len`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 2 and `list_len` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1, so `x` is 3. Since `list_len` is an integer, it remains the same.

State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 2, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 3**
