Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, list_len is an integer that must be greater than x + 1, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, rev_res is the concatenation of the string at index x+2 in operational_list and the string at index x in operational_list if x+2 is even, otherwise it is the concatenation of the string at index x+2 in operational_list, the string at index x+1 in operational_list with trailing zeros removed if x+1 is even, and the string at index x in operational_list if x+2 is odd, and the string at index x+1 in operational_list with trailing zeros removed if x+1 is even, x is either an even or odd number + 2**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by concatenating the string at index x in operational_list with its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The list_len is still greater than x + 1, and max_power remains the same. The operational_list is still a sorted list of strings.
