Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip(
        '0')) - len(x))
    for x in range(int(list_len)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
        else:
            rev_res += operational_list[x]
    if len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains 0 test cases, y is 0, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in operational_list with trailing zeros removed if the index of the string is even, x is equal to list_len. If the length of rev_res is greater than or equal to max_power + 1, then 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 1, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to list_len. rev_res is a string that is a concatenation of all strings in operational_list, with even-indexed strings having trailing zeros removed. If the length of rev_res is greater than or equal to max_power + 1, then 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed from the strings at even indices. If the length of rev_res is greater than or equal to max_power + 1, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
