Output State: **`rev_res` is increased by the value of the string at index 3 in `operational_list`, `y` is 2, `list_len` is an integer greater than 2, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 3, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by adding the string at index 3 in the sorted list `operational_list`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `y` still being 2, `list_len` being an integer greater than 2, `max_power` being an integer, `operational_list` being a sorted list of strings, and `x` being 3. Additionally, the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
