Postcondition: ***stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 2, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 3. If x is even, rev_res is increased by the value of operational_list[3] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is increased by the value of the string at index 3 in operational_list.***
