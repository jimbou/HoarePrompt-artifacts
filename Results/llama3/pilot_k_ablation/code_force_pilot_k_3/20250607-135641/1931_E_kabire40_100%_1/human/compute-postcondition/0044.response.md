Postcondition: ***stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 1, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to list_len. The length of rev_res is less than max_power + 1. rev_res is a string that is a concatenation of all strings in operational_list, with even-indexed strings having trailing zeros removed. 'Anna' is being printed.***
