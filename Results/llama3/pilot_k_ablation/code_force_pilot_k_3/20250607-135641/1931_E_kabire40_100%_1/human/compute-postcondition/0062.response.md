The code `rev_res += operational_list[x]` adds the value of `operational_list[x]` to `rev_res`. Since `x` is 4, `operational_list[x]` is the 5th element of `operational_list` (since indexing starts at 0). The value of `operational_list[x]` is a string, and it is added to `rev_res`.

Output State: **`rev_res` is increased by the 5th element of `operational_list`, `y` is 2, `list_len` is an integer greater than 3, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 4, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**
