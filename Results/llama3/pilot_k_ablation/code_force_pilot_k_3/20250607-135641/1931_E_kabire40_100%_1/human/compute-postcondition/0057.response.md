Output State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 2, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 3, rev_res is increased by the value of operational_list[3] with trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` is increased by the value of `operational_list[3]` with trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The values of `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `x` are still the same. The `operational_list` is still a sorted list of strings.
