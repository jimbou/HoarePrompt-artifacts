Output State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 1, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 2, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the first string in operational_list with trailing zeros removed and the string at index 2 in operational_list.**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by concatenating the string at index 2 in operational_list to its previous value, which was the first string in operational_list with trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
