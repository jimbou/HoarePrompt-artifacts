Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 1, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, rev_res is a string that is a suffix of operational_list[x+1] with trailing zeros removed if x+1 is even, otherwise it is the concatenation of the string at index x+1 in operational_list and the string at index x in operational_list, x is either an even or odd number + 1**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by concatenating the string at index x in operational_list to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
