Postcondition: ***stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, list_len is an integer that must be greater than x + 1, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, rev_res is a string that is a suffix of operational_list[x+2] with trailing zeros removed if x+2 is even, otherwise it is the concatenation of the string at index x+2 in operational_list and the string at index x+1 in operational_list if x+2 is odd, and the string at index x+1 in operational_list with trailing zeros removed if x+1 is even, and then concatenated with the string at index x in operational_list if x is even, otherwise it is the concatenation of the string at index x+2 in operational_list and the string at index x in operational_list if x+2 is even, otherwise it is the concatenation of the string at index x+2 in operational_list, the string at index x+1 in operational_list with trailing zeros removed if x+1 is even, and the string at index x in operational_list if x+2 is odd, and the string at index x+1 in operational_list with trailing zeros removed if x+1 is even, and x is either an even or odd number + 2***
