Output State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed from the strings at even indices.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `x` will be equal to `list_len`, and the value of `rev_res` will be a string that is the concatenation of all the strings in `operational_list`, with all trailing zeros removed from the strings at even indices. The values of `stdin`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged.
