Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, y is 0, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, rev_res is a string that is a suffix of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed, the current value of x is an even number**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending a suffix of `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The value of x is still an even number.
