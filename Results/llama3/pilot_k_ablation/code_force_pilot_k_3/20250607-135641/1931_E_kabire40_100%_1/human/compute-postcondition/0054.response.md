Output State: **`y` is 2, `list_len` is an integer greater than 0, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is not divisible by 2, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial properties, but the value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string at index `x` in the sorted list `operational_list` to its previous value. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
