Output State: **`y` is 1, `list_len` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, `max_power` is an integer, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `rev_res` is a string that is a concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list`, `x` is not divisible by 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial properties, except for `rev_res`, which has been updated to include the string at index `x` from the sorted list `operational_list`. The value of `x` is still not divisible by 2, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs.
