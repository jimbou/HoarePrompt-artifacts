Postcondition: ***stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings. If x is even, rev_res is a string that is the first element of operational_list with all trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index x in operational_list.***
