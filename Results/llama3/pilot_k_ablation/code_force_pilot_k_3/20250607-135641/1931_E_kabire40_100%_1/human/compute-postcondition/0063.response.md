Postcondition: ***stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 3, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 4. If x is even, rev_res is increased by the string value of operational_list[4] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is increased by the 5th element of operational_list.***
