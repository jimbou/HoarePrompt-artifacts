Output State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 3, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 4, rev_res is increased by the string value of operational_list[4] with trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` is updated by adding the string value of `operational_list[4]` with trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs. The value of `x` is still 4, and `y` is still 2. The length of the list `operational_list` is still greater than 3, and `max_power` is still an integer.
