Output State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 1, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to list_len. If the length of rev_res is greater than or equal to max_power + 1, then 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed. rev_res is a string that is a concatenation of all strings in operational_list, with even-indexed strings having trailing zeros removed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same conditions as the initial state, except for the value of x, which will be equal to list_len, and the value of rev_res, which will be a concatenation of all strings in operational_list, with even-indexed strings having trailing zeros removed. The printing of 'Sasha' or 'Anna' will depend on the length of rev_res compared to max_power + 1.
