To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `list_len`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `x` is less than `list_len`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is 1, and `list_len` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be incremented by 1, so `x` becomes 2. The value of `list_len` remains the same.

State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 1, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings. If x is even, rev_res is a string that is the first string in operational_list with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is a string that is a concatenation of its previous value and the string at index x in operational_list, x is 2**
