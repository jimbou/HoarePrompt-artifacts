Output State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 2, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 0, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 0, which is even, and rev_res is a string that is the first element of operational_list with all trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by appending the first element of operational_list (since x is 0) with all trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
