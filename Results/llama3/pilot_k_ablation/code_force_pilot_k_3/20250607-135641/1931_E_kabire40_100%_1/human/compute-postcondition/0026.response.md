To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `list_len`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `list_len`. If `list_len` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 1, list_len is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 1, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, rev_res is an empty string, x is 0**
