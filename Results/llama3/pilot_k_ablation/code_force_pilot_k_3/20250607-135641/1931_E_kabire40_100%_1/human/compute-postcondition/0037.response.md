Output State: **stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs, y is 1, list_len is an integer that must be greater than 2, max_power is an integer, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is 3, rev_res is a string that is the first string in operational_list with trailing zeros removed, the string at index 2 in operational_list and the string at index 3 in operational_list with trailing zeros removed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except for the variable rev_res. The variable rev_res now holds the value of the first string in operational_list with trailing zeros removed, the string at index 2 in operational_list and the string at index 3 in operational_list with trailing zeros removed.
