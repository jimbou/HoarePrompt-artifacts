Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

In this output state, the value of `clues` has been updated to a list of integers from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains one less integer than before, as one set of integers has been consumed by the input operation. The values of the other variables, `test_cases`, `answers`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
