Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is an integer, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
    elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
        if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
        if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1 and the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`, otherwise `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, otherwise `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` do not have the same parity, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the third element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, then if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, then 'Draw' is added to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to `answers`, otherwise 'Bob' is added. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to `answers`, otherwise 'Bob' is added. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, then if the third and fifth clues are equal, then 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is 1, then 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and fourth clues is greater than the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues divided by two, then 'Draw' is appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, if `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
