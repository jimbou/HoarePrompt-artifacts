Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. If `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of `(clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.***
