Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the sixth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, and the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The value of `i` remains 0, and the list of clues is unchanged. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus one integer. All the conditions related to the elements of the `clues` list are still valid.
