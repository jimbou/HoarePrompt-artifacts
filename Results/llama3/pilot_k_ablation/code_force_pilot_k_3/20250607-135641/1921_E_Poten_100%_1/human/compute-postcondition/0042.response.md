Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the third element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw', the value of `i` remains 0, and the list of clues remains unchanged. The conditions on the elements of the clues list are still satisfied. The only change is that the list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'.
