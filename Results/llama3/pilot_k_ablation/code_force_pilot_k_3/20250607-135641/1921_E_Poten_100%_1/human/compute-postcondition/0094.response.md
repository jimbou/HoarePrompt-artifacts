Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and one more 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Draw' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `test_cases` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 2, and `clues` is still a list of integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three integers.
