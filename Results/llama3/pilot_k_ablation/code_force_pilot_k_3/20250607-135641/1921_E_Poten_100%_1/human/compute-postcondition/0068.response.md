Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice', and an additional 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Alice' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `answers` now contains an additional 'Alice' in addition to its previous values, which could be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The value of `test_cases` is still greater than 1, `i` is still 1, and `clues` is still a list of integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
