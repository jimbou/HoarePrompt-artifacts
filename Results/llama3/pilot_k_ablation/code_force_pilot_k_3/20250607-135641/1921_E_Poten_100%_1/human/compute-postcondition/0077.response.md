Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, then if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers` if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
