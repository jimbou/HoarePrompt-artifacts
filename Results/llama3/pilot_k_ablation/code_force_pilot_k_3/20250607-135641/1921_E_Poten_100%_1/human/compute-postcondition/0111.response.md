The code prints the second answer in the list `answers`.
Since the exact `answers` list is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of the second answer. However, based on the structure of the problem, the second answer can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'.
Output: **the second answer in the list answers (which can be either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice')**
