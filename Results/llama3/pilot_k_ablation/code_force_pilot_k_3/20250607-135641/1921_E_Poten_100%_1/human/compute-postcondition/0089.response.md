Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then the value of `answers` is determined by the condition `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, if true, 'Draw' is added to `answers`, otherwise 'Bob' is added. Otherwise, `answers` remains unchanged.***
