Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include 'Draw' in addition to its previous values of either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three integers.
