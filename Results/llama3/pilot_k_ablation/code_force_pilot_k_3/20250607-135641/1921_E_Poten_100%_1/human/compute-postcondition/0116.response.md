Output State: **`test_cases` is 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains no integers, and all answers in the list have been printed.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list of answers will be empty because all answers have been printed, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
