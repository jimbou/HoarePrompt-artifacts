Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and an additional 'Bob', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending 'Bob' to the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `answers` now contains an additional 'Bob' in addition to its previous values, which could be 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. The value of `i` is still 1, and `clues` remains a list of integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
