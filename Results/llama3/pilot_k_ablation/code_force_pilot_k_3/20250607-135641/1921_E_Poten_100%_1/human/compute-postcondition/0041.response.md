Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the third element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2***
