Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity, and the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`.**

In this output state, the only change is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'Draw', while all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
