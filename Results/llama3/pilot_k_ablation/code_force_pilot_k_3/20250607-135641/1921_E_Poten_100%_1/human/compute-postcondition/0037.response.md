Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity, and the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', the value of `i` remains 0, and the list of clues remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer. All the conditions related to the elements of the `clues` list are still valid.
