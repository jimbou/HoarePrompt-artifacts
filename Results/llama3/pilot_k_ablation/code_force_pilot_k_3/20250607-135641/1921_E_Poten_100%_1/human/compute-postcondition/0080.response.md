Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers.**

In this output state, the value of `clues` has been updated to a list of integers from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.
