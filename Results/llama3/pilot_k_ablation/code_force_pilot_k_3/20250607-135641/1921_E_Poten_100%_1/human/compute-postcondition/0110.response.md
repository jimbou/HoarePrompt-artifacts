To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in answers:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `j` and `answers`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' that must have at least 1 answer, and `j` is the first answer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `answers` must have at least 2 answers, and `j` must be the second answer in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' that must have at least 2 answers, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains no integers, j is the second answer in the list**
