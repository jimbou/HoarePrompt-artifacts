Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1, the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity, and the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. If the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
