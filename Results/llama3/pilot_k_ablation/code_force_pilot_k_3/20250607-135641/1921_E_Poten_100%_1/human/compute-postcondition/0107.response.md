The only objects in the loop head are variable `j` and list `answers`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `answers`. If the list has at least 1 answer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is 0, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains no integers. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 answer and the j is the first answer in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' that must have at least 1 answer, `i` is equal to the initial value of `test_cases`, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains no integers, j is the first answer in the list**
