The code appends the string 'Bob' to the list `answers`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and has one more 'Bob' than before, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**
