The code appends 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The value of `answers` is updated by adding 'Draw' to its end. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw' is appended at the end of the list, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**
