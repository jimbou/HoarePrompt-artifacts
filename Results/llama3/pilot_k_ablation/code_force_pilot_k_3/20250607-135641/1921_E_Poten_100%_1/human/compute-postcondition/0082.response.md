The code `answers.append('Bob')` adds the string 'Bob' to the end of the list `answers`. The value of `answers` was a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice'. Now, it contains one more element 'Bob'. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Bob', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers.**
