Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, 'Alice' is appended to the end of the `answers` list. Otherwise, if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if the difference between `clues[1]` and `clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is appended to the end of the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to the end of the `answers` list. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Alice' is appended to `answers`.***
