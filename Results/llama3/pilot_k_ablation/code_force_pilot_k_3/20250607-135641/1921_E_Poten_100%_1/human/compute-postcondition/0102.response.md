Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers. If the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues is 1, then 'Alice' is appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, if the difference between the second and fourth clues is greater than the absolute difference between the third and fifth clues divided by two, then 'Draw' is appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, if `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list.***
