Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is added to the `answers` list. Otherwise, 'Alice' is added to the `answers` list.***
