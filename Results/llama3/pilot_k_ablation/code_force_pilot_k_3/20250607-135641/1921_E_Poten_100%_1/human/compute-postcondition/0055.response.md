Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Bob', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include 'Bob' as a new element in the list. The other variables remain unchanged, with `test_cases` still being greater than 1, `i` still being 1, and `clues` still being a list of integers from the input. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
