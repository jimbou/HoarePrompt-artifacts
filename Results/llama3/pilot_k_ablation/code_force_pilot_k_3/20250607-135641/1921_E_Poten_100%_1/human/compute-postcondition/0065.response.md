Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', 'Alice', and an additional 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated by appending an additional 'Alice' to the list, while the values of `test_cases`, `i`, and `clues` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one integer.
