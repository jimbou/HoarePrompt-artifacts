Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Bob', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. Additionally, the third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd). The current value of the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Bob', the value of `i` remains 0, and the list of clues remains unchanged. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The conditions regarding the elements of the clues list are still valid, including the third element being less than or equal to the fifth element, the first element not being 1, and the third and fifth elements having the same parity. Additionally, the third element of the clues list is still equal to the fifth element.
