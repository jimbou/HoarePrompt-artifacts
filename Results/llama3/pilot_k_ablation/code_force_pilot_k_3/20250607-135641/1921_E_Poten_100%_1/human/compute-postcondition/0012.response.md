Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` have the same parity (either both are even or both are odd). The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The list of answers now contains the string 'Draw'. The value of `i` remains 0. The list of clues is unchanged. The standard input still contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The properties of the clues list are still the same, including the first element not being 1, the third element being less than or equal to the fifth element, having the same parity, and the difference between the fifth element and 1 being greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third and fourth elements.
