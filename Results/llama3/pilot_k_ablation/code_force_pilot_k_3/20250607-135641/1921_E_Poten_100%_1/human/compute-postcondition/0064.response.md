Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then 'Bob' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then 'Draw' is appended to `answers`. Otherwise, 'Bob' is appended to `answers`.***
