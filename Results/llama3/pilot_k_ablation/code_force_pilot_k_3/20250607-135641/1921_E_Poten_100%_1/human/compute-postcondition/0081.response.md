The code `answers.append('Draw')` adds the string 'Draw' to the end of the list `answers`. The value of `answers` is updated to include 'Draw' as its last element. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' and 'Draw' as its last element, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers.**
