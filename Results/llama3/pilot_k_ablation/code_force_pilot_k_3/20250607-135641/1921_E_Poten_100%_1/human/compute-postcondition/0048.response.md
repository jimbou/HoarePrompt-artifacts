Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either 'Alice' or 'Draw', `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one integer. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than half of the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues`, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the third element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Draw' if the difference between the fourth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, otherwise `answers` contains 'Alice'.**
