Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice', `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three integers. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to `answers`, otherwise 'Bob' is added. If `clues[3]` is not less than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' is added to `answers`, otherwise if `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, 'Bob' is added, otherwise `answers` remains unchanged.***
