#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers and index is an integer such that 2 <= index <= len(array) - 1.
    array[index - 1] = array[index - 1] - 1
    array[index] = array[index] - 2

    #The program returns a list of integers where the element at index-1 has been decreased by 1, the element at index has been decreased by 2, and the element at index+1 has been decreased by 1, and index is an integer between 2 and the second last index of the list.

#Overall this is what the function does:Decreases the values of three consecutive elements in a list by specific amounts and returns the modified list. The function takes a list of integers and an index as input, and decreases the element at the index-1 by 1, the element at the index by 2, and the element at index+1 by 1. The function returns the modified list with the updated values.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arrayForSuccess is a list of integers.
    for x in arrayForSuccess:
        if x != 0:
            return False
        
    #State: `arrayForSuccess` is a list of integers with all elements equal to 0.
    return True
    #The program returns a boolean value True

#Overall this is what the function does:This function checks if all elements in the input list `arrayForSuccess` are equal to 0 and returns a boolean value indicating whether this condition is met. If any element is not 0, the function immediately returns False. If all elements are 0, the function returns True.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements.
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with 'inputarray' still being a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements that satisfies the condition 'func_2(inputarray)', and 'answers' still being a list containing the string 'YES'.
    #State: inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements. The function func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument.

            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:

    answers.append('NO')

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements satisfies a certain condition defined by the function func_2, and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the answers list accordingly. If the condition is met, the function returns without modifying the input array. If the condition is not met after 100 iterations of modifying the input array using the function func_1, the function appends 'NO' to the answers list.
