The only variable in the loop head is variable loop_counter, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable loop_counter.  If loop_counter is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, loop_counter is 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time loop_counter must be less than 100.
State: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2. highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1] and highestNumber is the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1] and highestNumber is non-negative.**
