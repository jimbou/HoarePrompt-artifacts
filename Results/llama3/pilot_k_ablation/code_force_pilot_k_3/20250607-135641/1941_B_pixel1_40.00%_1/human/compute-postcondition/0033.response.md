Postcondition: ***The length is at least 4, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestIndex is 3 and highestNumber is the value of inputarray at index 3. Otherwise, highestIndex and highestNumber remain unchanged.***
