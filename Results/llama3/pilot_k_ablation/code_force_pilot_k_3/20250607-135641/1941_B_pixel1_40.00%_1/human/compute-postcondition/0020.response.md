Output State: **The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. The state of the variables remains the same: 'answers' still contains the string 'NO', 'inputarray' is still a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, 'loop_counter' is still 1, 'func_2' still returns False when given 'inputarray' as an argument, 'length' is still at least 3, 'elementIndex' is still 'length - 2', 'highestIndex' is still the index of the maximum value in the subarray 'inputarray[1:length-1]', and 'highestNumber' is still the maximum value in the subarray 'inputarray[1:length-1]', which is less than 0.**
