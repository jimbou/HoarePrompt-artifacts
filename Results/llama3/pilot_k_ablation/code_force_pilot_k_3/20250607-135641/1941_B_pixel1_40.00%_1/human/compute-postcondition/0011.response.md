To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `elementIndex` and `length`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 1 and `length` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `elementIndex` must be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The value of `length` remains the same.

State: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is 2**
