To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are:

* `elementIndex`
* `length`

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 2, and `length` is at least 3.

To execute the loop again, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 3. The value of `length` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still greater than 3 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables mentioned in the state, such as `inputarray`, `loop_counter`, `func_2`, `highestNumber`, and `highestIndex`, are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **The length is at least 4, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 3, highestNumber and highestIndex are unchanged**
