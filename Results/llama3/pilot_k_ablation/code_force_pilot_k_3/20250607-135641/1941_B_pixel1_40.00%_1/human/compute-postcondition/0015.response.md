The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`. Since `elementIndex` is 3, `highestIndex` becomes 3. The second line assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 3, `highestNumber` becomes the value of the 4th element in `inputarray` (since indexing starts at 0).

Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is 3, highestIndex is 3, highestNumber is the value of the 4th element in inputarray**
