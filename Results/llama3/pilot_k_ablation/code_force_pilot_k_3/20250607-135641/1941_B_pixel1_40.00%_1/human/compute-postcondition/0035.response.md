The only variable in the loop head is loop_counter, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable loop_counter. If loop_counter is not equal to 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, loop_counter is less than 100, which ensures that the loop will execute again. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the state of loop_counter.

State: **The length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is length - 2. highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements), and highestNumber is the value of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements).**
