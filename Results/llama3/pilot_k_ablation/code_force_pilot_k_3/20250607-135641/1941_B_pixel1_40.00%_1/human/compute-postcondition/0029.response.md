Output State: **length is at least 3, highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is equal to elementIndex, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 2**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign new values to the variables `highestIndex` and `highestNumber`. The first line sets `highestIndex` to the current value of `elementIndex`, which is 2. The second line sets `highestNumber` to the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`, which is the value of the element at index 2 in the `inputarray`. 

Since `elementIndex` is 2, `highestIndex` becomes 2. The value of `highestNumber` is now equal to the value of the element at index 2 in the `inputarray`. 

The rest of the variables remain unchanged: `length` is still at least 3, `inputarray` is still a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, `loop_counter` is still less than 100, `func_2` still returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, and `elementIndex` is still 2.
