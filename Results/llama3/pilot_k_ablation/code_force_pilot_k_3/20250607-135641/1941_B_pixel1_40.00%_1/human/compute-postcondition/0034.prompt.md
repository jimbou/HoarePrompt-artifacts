Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1, inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is length - 2.
Code of the loop:
for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
    if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
        highestIndex = elementIndex
        highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *length is at least 3, highestNumber is either -1 or equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is either -1 or equal to elementIndex, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 1. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex] and highestIndex is updated to elementIndex.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 2. If the current value of inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex] and highestIndex is updated to elementIndex. Otherwise, no changes are made to highestNumber and highestIndex.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The length is at least 4, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestIndex is 3 and highestNumber is the value of inputarray at index 3. Otherwise, highestIndex and highestNumber remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
