To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `elementIndex` and `length`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `length` is at least 3 and `elementIndex` is within the range of 1 to `length - 2`.

State: **`length` is at least 3, `inputarray` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, `elementIndex` is 1, `highestIndex` is -1, and `highestNumber` is -1**
