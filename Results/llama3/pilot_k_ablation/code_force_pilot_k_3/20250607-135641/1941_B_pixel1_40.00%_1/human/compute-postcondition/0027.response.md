Postcondition: ***length is at least 3, highestNumber is either -1 or equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is either -1 or equal to elementIndex, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 1. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex] and highestIndex is updated to elementIndex.***
