Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is 1. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestNumber is updated to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex] and highestIndex is updated to elementIndex. Otherwise, no changes are made to highestNumber and highestIndex.***
