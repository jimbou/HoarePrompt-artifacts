You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements.
    if func_2(inputarray) :
        answers.append('YES')
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with 'inputarray' still being a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements that satisfies the condition 'func_2(inputarray)', and 'answers' still being a list containing the string 'YES'.
    #State: inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements. The function func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument.
    loop_counter = 1
    while loop_counter != 100:
        length = len(inputarray)
        
        highestNumber = -1
        
        highestIndex = -1
        
        for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
            if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
                highestIndex = elementIndex
                highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
        
        if highestNumber < 0:
            answers.append('NO')
            return
        
        newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
        
        if func_2(newArray):
            answers.append('YES')
            return
        
        loop_counter += 1
        
    #State: loop_counter is 100, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray, and highestNumber is the highest number in inputarray.
    answers.append('NO')

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with 'inputarray' still being a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements that satisfies the condition 'func_2(inputarray)', and 'answers' still being a list containing the string 'YES'.

Case_2: loop_counter is 100, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray, and highestNumber is the highest number in inputarray.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
