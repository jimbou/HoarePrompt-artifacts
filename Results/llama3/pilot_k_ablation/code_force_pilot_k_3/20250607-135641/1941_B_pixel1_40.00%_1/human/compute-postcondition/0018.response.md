Postcondition: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2. The current value of highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1] and the current value of highestNumber is the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1], which is less than 0.**
