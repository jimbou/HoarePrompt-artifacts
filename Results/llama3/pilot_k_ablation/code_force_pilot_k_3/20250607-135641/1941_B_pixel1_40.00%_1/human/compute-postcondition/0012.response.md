Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is 2, highestIndex is 2, highestNumber is the value of the element at index 2 in inputarray**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, making `highestIndex` equal to 2. It also assigns the value of the element at index `elementIndex` in `inputarray` to `highestNumber`, making `highestNumber` equal to the value of the element at index 2 in `inputarray`. No other variables are affected.
