Postcondition: **The values of `length`, `inputarray`, and `loop_counter` remain unchanged. If `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is set to the current value of `elementIndex` and `highestNumber` is set to the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. Otherwise, the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` remain unchanged.**
