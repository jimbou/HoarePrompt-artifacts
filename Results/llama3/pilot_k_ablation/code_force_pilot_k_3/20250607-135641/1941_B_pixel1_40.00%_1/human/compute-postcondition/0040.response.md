Postcondition: ***length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument. If inputarray[elementIndex] is greater than or equal to highestNumber, then highestIndex is set to 1 and highestNumber is set to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex]. Otherwise, the values of highestIndex and highestNumber remain unchanged.***
