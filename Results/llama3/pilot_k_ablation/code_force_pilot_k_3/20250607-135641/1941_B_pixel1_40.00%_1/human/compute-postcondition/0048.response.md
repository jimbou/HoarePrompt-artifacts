Output State: **loop_counter is 100, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray, and highestNumber is the highest number in inputarray.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter has reached 100, the input array remains a list of integers with at least 3 elements and all elements are non-negative, the length of the array is at least 3, the element index is at the second last position, the highest index is the position of the highest number in the array, and the highest number is the maximum value in the array.
