Postcondition: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is 1, `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 3. If the 4th element in `inputarray` is greater than or equal to the highest number, then `highestIndex` is 3 and `highestNumber` is the value of the 4th element in `inputarray`.**
