Postcondition: ***`length`, `inputarray`, and `loop_counter` remain unchanged, `elementIndex` is incremented by 1. If the value of `inputarray` at the new `elementIndex` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, then `highestIndex` is updated to the new `elementIndex` and `highestNumber` is updated to the value of `inputarray` at the new `elementIndex`.***
