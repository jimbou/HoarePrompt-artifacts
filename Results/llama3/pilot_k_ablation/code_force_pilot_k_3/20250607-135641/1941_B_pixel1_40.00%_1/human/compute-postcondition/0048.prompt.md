Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is 1, and the function `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument.
Code of the loop:
while loop_counter != 100:
    length = len(inputarray)
    highestNumber = -1
    highestIndex = -1
    for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):
        if inputarray[elementIndex] >= highestNumber:
            highestIndex = elementIndex
            highestNumber = inputarray[elementIndex]
    if highestNumber < 0:
        answers.append('NO')
        return
    newArray = func_1(inputarray, highestIndex)
    if func_2(newArray):
        answers.append('YES')
        return
    loop_counter += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2. highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1] and highestNumber is the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1] and highestNumber is non-negative.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is length - 2. highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements), and highestNumber is the value of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the highest number in the inputarray, and highestNumber is the highest number in the inputarray.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
