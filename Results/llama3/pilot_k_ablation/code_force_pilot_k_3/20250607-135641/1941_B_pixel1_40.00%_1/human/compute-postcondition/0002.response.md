Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no return statement with a value. The state of the variables remains unchanged, with 'inputarray' still being a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements that satisfies the condition 'func_2(inputarray)', and 'answers' still being a list containing the string 'YES'.**
