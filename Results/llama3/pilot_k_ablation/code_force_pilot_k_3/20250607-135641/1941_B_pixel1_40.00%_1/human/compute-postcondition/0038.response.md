Postcondition: **`length` is at least 3, `inputarray` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, `elementIndex` is 1, and the current value of `highestIndex` is -1 and `highestNumber` is -1. The current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`.**
