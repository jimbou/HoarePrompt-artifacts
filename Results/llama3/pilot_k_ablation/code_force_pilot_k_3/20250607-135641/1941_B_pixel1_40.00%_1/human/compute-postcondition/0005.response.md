The only variable in the loop head is variable `loop_counter`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `loop_counter`. If `loop_counter` is not equal to 100, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `loop_counter` is 1, which is not equal to 100, so the loop can certainly execute one time. Therefore, no adjustments are needed.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is 1, and the function `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument**
