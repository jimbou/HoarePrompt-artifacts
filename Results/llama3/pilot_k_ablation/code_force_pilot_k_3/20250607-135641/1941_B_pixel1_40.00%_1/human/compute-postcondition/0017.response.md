Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2. highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1] and highestNumber is the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `elementIndex` variable has reached the second last index of the `inputarray` (i.e., `length - 2`). The `highestIndex` variable now holds the index of the maximum value in the subarray `inputarray[1:length-1]`, and the `highestNumber` variable holds the maximum value in the same subarray. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
