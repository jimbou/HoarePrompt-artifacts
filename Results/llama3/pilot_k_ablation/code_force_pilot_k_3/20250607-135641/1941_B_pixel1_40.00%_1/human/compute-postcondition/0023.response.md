Output State: **length is the number of elements in inputarray, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1, inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is length - 2.**

The code assigns the length of inputarray to the variable length. The variables highestNumber and highestIndex are set to -1. The rest of the variables and their values remain unchanged.
