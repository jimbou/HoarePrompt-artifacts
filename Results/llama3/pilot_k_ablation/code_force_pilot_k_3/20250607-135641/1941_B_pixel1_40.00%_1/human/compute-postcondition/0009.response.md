Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is equal to elementIndex, elementIndex is 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that update the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber`. The first line assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`, and the second line assigns the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 1 and the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`, the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` are updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
