The only variables in the loop head are variables `elementIndex` and `length`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `length`. If `length` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `length` is at least 3, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `elementIndex` to be 1, since the loop starts from 1.

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is 1, `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, `length` is at least 3, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `elementIndex` is 1**
