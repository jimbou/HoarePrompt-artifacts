Output State: **The length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is length - 2. highestIndex is the index of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements), and highestNumber is the value of the highest number in inputarray (excluding the first and last elements).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the input array (excluding the first and last elements), and has found the highest number among these elements. The index of this highest number is stored in the variable highestIndex, and the value of this highest number is stored in the variable highestNumber. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
