Output State: **The length is at least 4, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 3, highestIndex is 3, and highestNumber is the value of inputarray at index 3.**

In this output state, the code has updated the values of `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` based on the value of `elementIndex`, which is 3. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial properties.
