To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elementIndex`, `length`, and the range `1` and `length - 1`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `length - 1` is greater than `1`, i.e., `length` must be at least `3`. Since `elementIndex` is the loop variable, it will take values from `1` to `length - 2` (since the range is exclusive of `length - 1`).

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`length` is at least 3, `highestNumber` is -1, `highestIndex` is -1, `inputarray` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, `loop_counter` is less than 100, `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, `elementIndex` is 1**
