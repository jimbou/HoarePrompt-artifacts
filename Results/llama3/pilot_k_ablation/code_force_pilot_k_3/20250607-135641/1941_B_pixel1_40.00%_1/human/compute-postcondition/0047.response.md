Output State: **length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the highest number in the inputarray, and highestNumber is the highest number in the inputarray.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the length, input array, and loop counter remain unchanged. The element index is now at the second last position in the input array. The highest index and highest number have been updated to the index and value of the highest number in the input array, respectively.
