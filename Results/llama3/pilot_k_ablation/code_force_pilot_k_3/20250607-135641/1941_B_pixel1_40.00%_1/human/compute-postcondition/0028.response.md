To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `elementIndex` and `length`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `elementIndex` is less than `length - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `elementIndex` is 1, and `length` is at least 3.

To execute the loop again, `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The value of `length` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still greater than 2 to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **length is at least 3, highestNumber is either -1 or equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is either -1 or equal to elementIndex, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 2**
