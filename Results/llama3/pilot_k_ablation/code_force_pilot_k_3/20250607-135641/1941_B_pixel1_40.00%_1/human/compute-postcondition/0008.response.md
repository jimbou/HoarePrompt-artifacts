Postcondition: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is 1, `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, `length` is at least 3, `highestNumber` is initially -1, `highestIndex` is initially -1, `elementIndex` is 1. The current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`.**
