Output State: **length is at least 3, highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex], highestIndex is equal to elementIndex, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 1.**

The code assigns the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber` and assigns `elementIndex` to `highestIndex`. Since `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to `highestNumber`, `highestNumber` is updated to this new value. The value of `elementIndex` is assigned to `highestIndex`. No other variables are affected by the code.
