Output State: **`loop_counter` is 100, `inputarray` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, length is at least 3, `elementIndex` is `length - 2`, `highestIndex` is the index of the highest number in `inputarray`, `highestNumber` is the highest number in `inputarray`, and `answers` has one more element 'NO' appended to it.**

In this output state, the values of `loop_counter`, `inputarray`, `elementIndex`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber` remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `answers` now has an additional element 'NO' appended to it.
