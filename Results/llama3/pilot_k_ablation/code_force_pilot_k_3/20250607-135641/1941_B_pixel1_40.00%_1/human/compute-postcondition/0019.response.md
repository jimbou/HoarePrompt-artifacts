Output State: **`answers` has been appended with the string 'NO', inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is length - 2, highestIndex is the index of the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1], and highestNumber is the maximum value in the subarray inputarray[1:length-1], which is less than 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that the list `answers` now contains the string 'NO' as its last element, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `inputarray` still contains non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is still 1, `func_2` still returns False for `inputarray`, `length` is still at least 3, `elementIndex` is still `length - 2`, and `highestIndex` and `highestNumber` still hold the index and value of the maximum element in the subarray `inputarray[1:length-1]`, which is less than 0.
