Output State: **length is at least 3, inputarray is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, all elements are non-negative, loop_counter is less than 100, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, elementIndex is 1, highestIndex is 1, and highestNumber is equal to the current value of inputarray[elementIndex].**

The code assigns the value of `elementIndex` to `highestIndex` and the value of `inputarray[elementIndex]` to `highestNumber`. Since `elementIndex` is 1 and `inputarray[elementIndex]` is greater than or equal to the current value of `highestNumber`, `highestIndex` becomes 1 and `highestNumber` becomes equal to the current value of `inputarray[elementIndex]`. No other variables are affected.
