The code snippet assigns the length of `inputarray` to `length`, and initializes `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` to -1. Since `inputarray` has at least 3 elements, `length` will be at least 3. The values of `highestNumber` and `highestIndex` are set to -1, indicating that no highest number or index has been found yet. The value of `loop_counter` and the return value of `func_2` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, highestNumber is -1, highestIndex is -1**
