Output State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is 1, and the function `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument.**

In this output state, the value of `loop_counter` has been initialized to 1, while the properties of `inputarray` and the behavior of `func_2` remain unchanged.
