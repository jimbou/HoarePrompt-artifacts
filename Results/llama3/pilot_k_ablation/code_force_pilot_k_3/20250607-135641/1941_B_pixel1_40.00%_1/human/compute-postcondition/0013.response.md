Postcondition: ***inputarray is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, loop_counter is 1, func_2 returns False when given inputarray as an argument, length is at least 3, elementIndex is 2. If the element at index 2 in inputarray is greater than or equal to the highestNumber, then highestIndex is 2 and highestNumber is the value of the element at index 2 in inputarray.***
