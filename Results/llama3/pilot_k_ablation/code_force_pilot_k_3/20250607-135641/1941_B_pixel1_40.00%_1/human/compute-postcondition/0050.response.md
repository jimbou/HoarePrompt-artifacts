Functionality: **Determines whether a given list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements satisfies a certain condition defined by the function func_2, and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the answers list accordingly. If the condition is met, the function returns without modifying the input array. If the condition is not met after 100 iterations of modifying the input array using the function func_1, the function appends 'NO' to the answers list.**
