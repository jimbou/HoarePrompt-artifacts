To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for elementIndex in range(1, length - 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements.
* `loop_counter` is 1.
* `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument.
* `length` is at least 3.
* `elementIndex` is 2.
* If the element at index 2 in `inputarray` is greater than or equal to the highestNumber, then `highestIndex` is 2 and `highestNumber` is the value of the element at index 2 in `inputarray`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head variables `elementIndex` and `length`.

* `elementIndex` needs to be incremented by 1 to point to the next element in the range. So, `elementIndex` becomes 3.
* `length` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables (`inputarray`, `loop_counter`, `func_2`, `highestIndex`, and `highestNumber`) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`inputarray` is a list of integers, all elements are non-negative and the list has at least 3 elements, `loop_counter` is 1, `func_2` returns False when given `inputarray` as an argument, `length` is at least 3, `elementIndex` is 3**
