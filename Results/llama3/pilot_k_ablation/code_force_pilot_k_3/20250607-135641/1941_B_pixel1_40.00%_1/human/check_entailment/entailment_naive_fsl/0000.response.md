Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. One example where the program fails is when the input array is [1, 2, 7, 2]. The program will output 'NO', but it is actually possible to make all elements of the array zero using the described operations.

The issue with the program is that it only tries to apply the operation at the index with the highest number, and it only tries this for a maximum of 100 iterations. This is not sufficient to guarantee that the program will find a solution if one exists. A correct program would need to use a more sophisticated algorithm to find a solution, such as a breadth-first search or a depth-first search.

For example, a correct program could work as follows:

* Start with the original array
* Try applying the operation at each possible index
* For each resulting array, try applying the operation at each possible index again
* Continue this process until a solution is found or it is determined that no solution exists

This approach would guarantee that the program finds a solution if one exists, but it would also be much more computationally expensive than the original program.
