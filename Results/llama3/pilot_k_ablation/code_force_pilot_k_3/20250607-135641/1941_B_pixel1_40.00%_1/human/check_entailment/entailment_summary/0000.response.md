Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3.

Func_1 decreases the values of three consecutive elements in a list by specific amounts and returns the modified list. This function simulates the operation that Rudolf can apply to the array.

Func_2 checks if all elements in the input list are equal to 0 and returns a boolean value indicating whether this condition is met. This function is used to determine whether the array can be made equal to zero.

Func_3 determines whether a given list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements satisfies a certain condition defined by func_2, and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the answers list accordingly. This function uses func_1 to modify the input array and checks if the condition is met after each modification. If the condition is not met after 100 iterations, the function appends 'NO' to the answers list.

The program iterates over multiple test cases, reads the input array for each case, and calls func_3 to determine whether the array can be made equal to zero. The results are appended to the answers list and printed at the end.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the problem description and uses the functions to determine whether the array can be made equal to zero. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
