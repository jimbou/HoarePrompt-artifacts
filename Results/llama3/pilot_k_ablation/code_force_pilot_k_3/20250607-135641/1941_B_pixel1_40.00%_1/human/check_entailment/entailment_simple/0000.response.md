Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether Rudolf can make all elements of an array equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decreasing the elements at indices i-1, i, and i+1 by 1, 2, and 1, respectively.

The program uses three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. func_1 implements the operation, func_2 checks if all elements in the array are zero, and func_3 is the main function that tries to make all elements zero using the operation.

In func_3, the program first checks if the input array already has all elements equal to zero using func_2. If it does, the program appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns.

If not, the program enters a loop that tries to make all elements zero by repeatedly applying the operation. In each iteration, it finds the index of the highest number in the array (excluding the first and last elements) and applies the operation at that index. It then checks if the resulting array has all elements equal to zero using func_2. If it does, the program appends 'YES' to the answers list and returns.

If the loop completes 100 iterations without making all elements zero, the program appends 'NO' to the answers list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should be able to determine whether Rudolf can make all elements of the array equal to zero using the specified operation.

Correctness: **True**
