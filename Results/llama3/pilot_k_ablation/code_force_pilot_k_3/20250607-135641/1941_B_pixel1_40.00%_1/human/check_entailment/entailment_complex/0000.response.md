Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a given list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements can be made equal to zero using a specific operation. The operation involves decreasing the values of three consecutive elements in the list by specific amounts.

The program consists of three functions: func_1, func_2, and func_3. 

- func_1 takes a list of integers and an index as input, decreases the element at the index-1 by 1, the element at the index by 2, and the element at index+1 by 1, and returns the modified list.

- func_2 checks if all elements in the input list are equal to 0 and returns a boolean value indicating whether this condition is met.

- func_3 determines whether a given list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements satisfies the condition defined by func_2, and appends 'YES' or 'NO' to the answers list accordingly.

The program iterates over each test case, reads the input array, and calls func_3 to determine whether the array can be made equal to zero using the specified operation. The result is appended to the answers list.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
