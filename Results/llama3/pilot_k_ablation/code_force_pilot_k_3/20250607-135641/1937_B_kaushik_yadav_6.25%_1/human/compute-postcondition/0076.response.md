Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False, `counter` is either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases. If `work` is True, `ans` contains the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, or the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, `ans` contains the first character of `b`.***
