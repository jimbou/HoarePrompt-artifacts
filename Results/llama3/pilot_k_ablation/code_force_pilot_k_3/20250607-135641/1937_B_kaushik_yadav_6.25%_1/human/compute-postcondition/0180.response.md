Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1, `j` is 0. The string `ans` was printed. If `work` is True, `ans` was a string equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` was equal to the length of `a`. If `work` is False, `ans` was a string containing the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` was equal to the length of `a`. Otherwise, no changes were made.***
