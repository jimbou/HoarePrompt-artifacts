Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, b is a binary string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True, counter is either 1 or len(a) - 1, j is len(a) - 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work`, `i` is either 0 or 1, `work` is True if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise `work` is False, `counter` is either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases. If `work` is True, `ans` contains the first character of `a` and either the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)`, or the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, `ans` contains the first character of `b`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work`. If `work` is True, `ans` is followed by the character at index `i` of `b` if `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`. If `work` is False, `ans` is followed by the character at index `i` of `b`. `i` is less than `len(a)`, `counter` is either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work`, followed by the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is True and `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, or the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is False, and then the character at index `i` of `a` if `work` is True and `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise the character at index `i` of `b`, `i` is either less than `len(a) - 1` and has been incremented by 1 if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, or is equal to `len(a) - 1` otherwise, `counter` is either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, `work` is False if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise its value is unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
