Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is a binary string that is one character longer than its previous value, and the last character of `ans` is either '0' or '1'.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Since `i` was initially less than `len(a)`, it is now either still less than `len(a)` or equal to `len(a)`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
