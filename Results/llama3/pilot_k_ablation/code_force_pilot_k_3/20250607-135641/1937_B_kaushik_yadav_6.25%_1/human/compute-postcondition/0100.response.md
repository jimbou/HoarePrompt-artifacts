Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work`, followed by the characters at indices `i` of `b` if `work` is False, or the characters at indices `i` of `a` if `work` is True and `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise the characters at indices `i` of `b`, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is False if `i + 1 < len(a)` and `b[i] < a[i + 1]`, otherwise its value is unchanged, `counter` is 1, `j` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases, and the string `ans` is being printed. The current value of `a[j + 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j]`.***
