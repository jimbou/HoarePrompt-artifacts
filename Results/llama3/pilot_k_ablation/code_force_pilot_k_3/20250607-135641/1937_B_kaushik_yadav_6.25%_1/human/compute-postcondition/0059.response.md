Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a binary string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is True or False, `counter` is either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, and the binary string `ans` is being printed, `j` is `len(a) - 2`. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1. Otherwise, `counter` remains either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, and the value of `counter` which is either 1 or `len(a) - 1` is being printed**
