Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of counter is printed**
