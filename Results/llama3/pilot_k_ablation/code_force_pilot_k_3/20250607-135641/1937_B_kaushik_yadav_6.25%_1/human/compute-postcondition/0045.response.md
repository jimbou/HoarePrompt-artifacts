Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a binary string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is True or False, `counter` is 1, and the binary string `ans` is being printed, `j` is 0. The current value of `a[j + 1]` is '0' and the current value of `b[j]` is '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still an integer greater than 0, and stdin still contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `ans`, `i`, `work`, and `j` are also unchanged. The current values of `a[j + 1]` and `b[j]` are still '0' and '1', respectively.
