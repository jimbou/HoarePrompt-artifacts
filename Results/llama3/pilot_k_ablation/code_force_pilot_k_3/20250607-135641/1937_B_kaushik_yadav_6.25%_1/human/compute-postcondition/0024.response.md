Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `ans` is a string that includes the character at index `i` of string `a` added to its previous value. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `ans` also includes the character at index `i` of string `b`. Otherwise, `ans` includes the character at index `i-1` of string `a` added to its previous value. stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case.***
