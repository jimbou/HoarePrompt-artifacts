Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work` and the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `work` is False, `counter` is either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `work` has been updated to False. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
