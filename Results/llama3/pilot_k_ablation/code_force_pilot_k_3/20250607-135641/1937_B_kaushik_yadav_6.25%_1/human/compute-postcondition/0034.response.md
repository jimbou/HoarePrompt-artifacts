Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, a is not empty binary string, b is a binary string, len(a) is greater than 0, i is less than len(a) and equals its original value plus 1, ans is a binary string equal to its original value plus b[i].**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The binary strings `a` and `b` remain unchanged as well, with `a` still being not empty and having a length greater than 0. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now equal to its original value plus 1, and it is still less than the length of `a`. The variable `ans` is a binary string that is equal to its original value plus the character at index `i` of string `b`.
