Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string that is equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` is equal to the length of `a`. If `work` is False, `ans` is a string containing the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` is equal to the length of `a`. `counter` is 1. The string `ans` is printed.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(a) - 1):
    if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
        counter += 1
    if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
        counter = 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1, `j` is 0. The string `ans` was printed. If `work` is True, `ans` was a string equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` was equal to the length of `a`. If `work` is False, `ans` was a string containing the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` was equal to the length of `a`. Otherwise, no changes were made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that was printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 3 characters and its length must be greater than 2, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that was printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1 and `j` is not 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
