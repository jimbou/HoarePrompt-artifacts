Output: **The string ans that contains the first character of either a or b depending on the value of work, followed by the characters at indices i of b if work is False, or the characters at indices i of a if work is True and i + 1 is equal to len(a) or b[i] is greater than or equal to a[i + 1], otherwise the characters at indices i of b, where a and b are binary strings, work is a boolean value, i is equal to len(a), and len(a) is the length of the binary string a**
