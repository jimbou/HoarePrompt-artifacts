Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, n is an integer, a is not empty binary string, b is a binary string. If work is True, then ans is a string with the first character of a appended to it. If i + 1 is less than len(a) and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], then work is False. Otherwise, if i + 1 is equal to len(a), then the character at index i of b is appended to ans. Otherwise, i is incremented by 1. Additionally, either i + 1 is not less than len(a) or b[i] is not less than a[i + 1]. If work is False, then ans is a string that contains the first character of b, i is 1, and work is False.***
