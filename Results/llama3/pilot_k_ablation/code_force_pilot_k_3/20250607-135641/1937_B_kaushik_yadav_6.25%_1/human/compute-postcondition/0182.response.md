The value of `counter` is incremented by 1, and its initial value is 1. So, the value of `counter` is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string, `counter` is 2, `j` is 1, `work` is either True or False, `ans` is a string that was printed**
