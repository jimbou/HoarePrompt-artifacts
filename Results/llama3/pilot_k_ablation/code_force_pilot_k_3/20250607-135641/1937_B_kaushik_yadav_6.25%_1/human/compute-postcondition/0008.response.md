Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a` appended to it, `i` is 0, and the current value of `work` is True. Additionally, either `i + 1` is not less than `len(a)` or `b[i]` is not less than `a[i + 1]`.***
