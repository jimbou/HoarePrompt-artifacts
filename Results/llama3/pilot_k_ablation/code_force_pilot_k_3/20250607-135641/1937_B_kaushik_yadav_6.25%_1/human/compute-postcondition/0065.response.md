Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of `a`, `i` is 0, `work` is True, `counter` is either 1 or len(a) - 1, `j` is len(a) - 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases. The current value of `i` is less than the length of `a` minus 1, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i + 1` in `a`.**
