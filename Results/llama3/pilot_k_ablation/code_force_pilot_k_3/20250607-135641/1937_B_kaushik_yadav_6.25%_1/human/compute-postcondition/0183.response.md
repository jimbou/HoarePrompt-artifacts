Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that was printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `counter` is 2 and `j` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
