Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a binary string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is True or False, `counter` is 1, and the binary string `ans` is being printed, `j` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case. The binary string `ans` is still being printed. The value of `j` is still 1.
