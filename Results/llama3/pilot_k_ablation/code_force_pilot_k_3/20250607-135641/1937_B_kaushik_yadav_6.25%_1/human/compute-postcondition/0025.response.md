Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, n is an integer, a is not empty binary string, b is a binary string, i is less than len(a) and greater than its original value by 1, len(a) is greater than 0, ans is a string that is the original value of ans plus the character at index i of string b.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the character at index `i` of string `b`. The value of `i` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
