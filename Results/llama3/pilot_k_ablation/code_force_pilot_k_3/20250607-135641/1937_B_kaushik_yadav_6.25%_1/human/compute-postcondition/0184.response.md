Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that was printed, `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of counter is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable `t` is still an integer greater than 0, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a binary string with at least 2 characters and its length is still greater than 0, `b` is still a binary string, and `ans` is still a string that was printed. Additionally, if `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is still 1.
