Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a binary string, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `work` is True or False, `counter` is 2, and the binary string `ans` is being printed, `j` is 0. The current value of `a[j + 1]` is equal to the current value of `b[j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1, making it 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
