Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 1. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The variable `counter` is reset to 1 if `a[j + 1]` is '0' and `b[j]` is '1' at any point during the loop. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is equal to the length of `a` minus 1, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations.
