Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 2 characters and its length must be greater than 0, `b` is a binary string. The current value of `work` is either True or False. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string that was equal to the first character of `a` plus the character at index `i` of `b`, and `i` was equal to the length of `a`. If `work` is False, `ans` was a string containing the first character of `b` plus the character at index `i` of `a`, and `i` was equal to the length of `a`. The string `ans` was printed, `counter` is 1, and `j` is 0. Additionally, the character at index `j + 1` of `a` is equal to the character at index `j` of `b`.**
