Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `len(a)`, `ans` is a binary string that is one or two characters longer than its previous value. If `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, the last two characters of `ans` are either '00', '01', '10', or '11'. Otherwise, the last character of `ans` is either '0' or '1'.***
