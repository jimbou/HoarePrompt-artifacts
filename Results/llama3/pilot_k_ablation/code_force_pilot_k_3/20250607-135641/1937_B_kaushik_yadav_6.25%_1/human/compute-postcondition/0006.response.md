Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string with the first character of `a` appended to it, `i` is 0, and the current value of `work` is True. Additionally, the current index `i` plus one is less than the length of `a`, and the character at index `i` in `b` is less than the character at index `i+1` in `a`.**
