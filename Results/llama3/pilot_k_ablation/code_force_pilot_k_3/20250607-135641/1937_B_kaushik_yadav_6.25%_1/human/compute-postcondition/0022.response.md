Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `i` is less than or equal to `len(a)`, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `ans` is a string that includes the character at index `i-1` of string `a` added to its previous value, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to `len(a)`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case.
