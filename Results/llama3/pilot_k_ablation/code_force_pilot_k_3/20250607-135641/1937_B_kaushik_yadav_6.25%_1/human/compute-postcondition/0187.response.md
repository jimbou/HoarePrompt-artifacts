Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 3 characters and its length must be greater than 2, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that was printed. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1', then `counter` is 2. If `a[j + 1]` is equal to `b[j]`, then `j` is 2. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `j` and `counter` are still valid, but the value of `counter` has been updated to 2 when `a[j + 1]` is equal to '0' and `b[j]` is equal to '1'.
