Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, n is an integer, a is a binary string, b is a binary string, ans is an empty string, i is 0, work is True
Code of the loop:
while i < len(a):
    if work:
        ans += a[i]
        if i + 1 < len(a) and b[i] < a[i + 1]:
            work = False
        elif i + 1 == len(a):
            ans += b[i]
            break
        else:
            i += 1
    else:
        ans += b[i]
        i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case, n is an integer, a is not empty binary string, b is a binary string. If work is True, then ans is a string with the first character of a appended to it. If i + 1 is less than len(a) and b[i] is less than a[i + 1], then work is False. Otherwise, if i + 1 is equal to len(a), then the character at index i of b is appended to ans. Otherwise, i is incremented by 1. Additionally, either i + 1 is not less than len(a) or b[i] is not less than a[i + 1]. If work is False, then ans is a string that contains the first character of b, i is 1, and work is False.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `len(a)` is greater than 0. If `work` is True, `ans` is a string that includes the character at index `i` of string `a` added to its previous value. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False. Otherwise, if `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, `ans` also includes the character at index `i` of string `b`. Otherwise, `ans` includes the character at index `i-1` of string `a` added to its previous value. If `work` is False, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` is a string that is the original value of `ans` plus the character at index `i` of string `b`. stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus one test case.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `i` is less than or equal to `len(a)`. If `work` is True, then `ans` is a binary string that is one or two characters longer than its previous value. If `i + 1` is less than `len(a)` and `b[i]` is less than `a[i + 1]`, then `work` is False and the last character of `ans` is either '0' or '1'. If `i + 1` equals `len(a)`, the last two characters of `ans` are either '00', '01', '10', or '11'. Otherwise, the last character of `ans` is either '0' or '1'. If `work` is False, then `i` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is appended with `b[i]`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
