Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is a non-empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `len(a)`, `ans` is a binary string that is one character longer than its previous value, and the last character of `ans` is either '0' or '1', `work` is False.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `work` is introduced with a value of False. The state of the other variables remains the same as in the initial state.
