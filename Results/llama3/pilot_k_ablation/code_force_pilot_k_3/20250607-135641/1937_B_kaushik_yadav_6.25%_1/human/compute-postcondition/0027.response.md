The variable in the loop head is variable i and len(a), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and len(a). If i is less than len(a), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is not specified, len(a) is greater than 0. i being not specified does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to i is less than len(a). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `a` is not empty binary string, `b` is a binary string, `len(a)` is greater than 0, `i` is less than `len(a)`**
