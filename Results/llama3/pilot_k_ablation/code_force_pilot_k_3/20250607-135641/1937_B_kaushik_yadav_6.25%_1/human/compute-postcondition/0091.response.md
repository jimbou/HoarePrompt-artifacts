Postcondition: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a binary string that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a binary string, `ans` is a string that contains the first character of either `a` or `b` depending on the value of `work`, followed by the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is True and `i + 1` is equal to `len(a)` or `b[i]` is greater than or equal to `a[i + 1]`, or the character at index `i` of `b` if `work` is False, and then the character at index `i` of `a`, `i` is either less than `len(a) - 1` and has been incremented by 1 or is equal to `len(a) - 1`, `counter` is either 1 or `len(a) - 1`, `j` is `len(a) - 2`, stdin contains multiple test cases with two binary strings of the same length minus two test cases.**
