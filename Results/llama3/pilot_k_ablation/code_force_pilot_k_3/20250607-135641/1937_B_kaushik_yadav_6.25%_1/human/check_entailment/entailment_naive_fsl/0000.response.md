Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the lexicographically smallest string is not the one that can be attained by always moving right or always moving down. 

For example, consider the input:

3
2
10
01

The lexicographically smallest string is "01", but the program will output "10" because it always moves right first. 

The program should consider all possible paths and find the lexicographically smallest string among them. 

Here is a possible correct solution:

```python
import sys

def func():
    input = sys.stdin.readline
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        a = input().strip()
        b = input().strip()
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(2)]
        dp[0][0] = a[0]
        dp[1][0] = b[0]
        for i in range(1, n):
            if dp[0][i - 1] < dp[1][i - 1]:
                dp[0][i] = a[i]
                dp[1][i] = b[i - 1]
            elif dp[0][i - 1] > dp[1][i - 1]:
                dp[0][i] = a[i - 1]
                dp[1][i] = b[i]
            else:
                dp[0][i] = a[i]
                dp[1][i] = b[i]
        ans = min(dp[0], dp[1])
        print(''.join(ans))
        counter = 1
        for j in range(len(a) - 1):
            if a[j + 1] == b[j]:
                counter += 1
            if a[j + 1] == '0' and b[j] == '1':
                counter = 1
        print(counter)
```

This solution uses dynamic programming to find the lexicographically smallest string among all possible paths.
