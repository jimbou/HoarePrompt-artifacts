This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer and two binary strings of the same length as the integer. It then constructs a new string by iterating through the binary strings and appending characters based on certain conditions. The function prints the constructed string and a counter value, which is incremented based on specific conditions encountered during the iteration. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
