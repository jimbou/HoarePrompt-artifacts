Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input array, adds each element to a set along with its 1-based index, and then prints the elements of the set in decreasing order.

The key insight here is that the set automatically removes duplicates, which is exactly what the problem description requires. By adding each element to the set along with its index, the program ensures that each element is unique and can be sorted in decreasing order.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array has duplicate elements. In this case, the set will only store one copy of each element, which is the desired behavior.

The program's use of the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument ensures that the elements are printed in decreasing order, which is also required by the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
