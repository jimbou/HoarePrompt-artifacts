Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the problem description by adding each element in the array to its 1-based index and storing the results in a set. The set automatically removes any duplicate elements, which is in line with the problem description. Finally, the program prints the elements of the set in descending order, which corresponds to the lexicographically largest b that Stack can make.

Correctness: **True**
