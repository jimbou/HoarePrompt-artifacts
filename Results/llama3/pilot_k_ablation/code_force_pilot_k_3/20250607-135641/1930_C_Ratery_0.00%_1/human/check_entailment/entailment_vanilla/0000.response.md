Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` by performing a series of operations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `a`.
3. It creates an empty set `st` to store unique elements.
4. It iterates over the array `a` and adds each element `a[i]` plus its index `i` plus 1 to the set `st`. This is equivalent to performing the three-step operation described in the problem statement.
5. After iterating over the entire array, the set `st` contains the unique elements that can be used to construct the array `b`.
6. The program sorts the elements in the set `st` in descending order using the `sorted` function with the `reverse=True` argument.
7. Finally, it prints the sorted elements as the lexicographically largest array `b`.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the steps described in the problem statement. The use of a set to store unique elements ensures that duplicates are eliminated, and the sorting step produces the lexicographically largest array `b`.

Correctness: **True**
