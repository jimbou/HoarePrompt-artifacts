Output State: **n is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, st is a set containing n elements which are arr[0] + 1, arr[1] + 2, ..., arr[n-1] + n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the set `st` will contain `n` elements, each of which is the sum of the corresponding element in the list `arr` and its 1-based index. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, and the other variables will remain unchanged.
