Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing one element which is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been updated to include one element, which is the sum of the first element of `arr` and 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
