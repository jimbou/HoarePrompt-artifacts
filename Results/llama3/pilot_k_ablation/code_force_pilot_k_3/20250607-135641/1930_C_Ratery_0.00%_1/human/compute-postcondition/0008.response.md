The code prints the elements of the set `st` in descending order.
The set `st` contains elements that are the sum of each element in the list `arr` and its 1-based index. For example, the first element of `st` is `arr[0] + 1`, the second element is `arr[1] + 2`, and so on.
Since the list `arr` contains `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, and `n` is an integer between 0 and 3 * 10^5, the elements of `st` will be between 2 and 3 * 10^5 + 10^9.
The `sorted` function is used to sort the elements of `st` in descending order, and the `*` operator is used to unpack the sorted list into separate arguments to the `print` function.
Therefore, the output will be the elements of `st` in descending order, separated by spaces.
Output: **elements of st in descending order (where st is a set containing elements that are the sum of each element in the list arr and its 1-based index)**
