Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing three elements which are `arr[0] + 1`, `arr[1] + 2`, and `arr[2] + 3`, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been updated to include a new element which is `arr[2] + 3`, since `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
