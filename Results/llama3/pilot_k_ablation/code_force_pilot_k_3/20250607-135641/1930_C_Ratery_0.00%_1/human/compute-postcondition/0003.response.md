The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing one element which is `arr[0] + 1`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
