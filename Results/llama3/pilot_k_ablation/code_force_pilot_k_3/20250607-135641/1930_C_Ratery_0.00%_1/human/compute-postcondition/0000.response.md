Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n integers between 1 and 10^9, st is an empty set, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 3 * 10^5, which is the value read from the input. The value of `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, which is the list of integers read from the input after reading `n`. The value of `st` is an empty set, which is the initial value assigned to it. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one because two lines of input were read and processed.
