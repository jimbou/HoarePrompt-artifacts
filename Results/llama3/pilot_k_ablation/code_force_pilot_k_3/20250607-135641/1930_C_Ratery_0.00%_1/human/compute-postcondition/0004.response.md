Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `st` is a set containing two elements which are `arr[0] + 1` and `arr[1] + 2`, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `st` has been updated to include a new element which is `arr[1] + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, indicating that the code has only processed the second element of the array. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, as the code has not consumed any input from stdin.
