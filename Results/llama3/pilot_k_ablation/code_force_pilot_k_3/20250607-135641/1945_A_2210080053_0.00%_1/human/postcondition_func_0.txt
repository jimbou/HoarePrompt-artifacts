The function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c. It calculates the sum of b and c, then prints a tuple containing the difference between a and the integer division of the sum by 3 if c is greater than or equal to the remainder of the sum divided by 3, otherwise it prints -1. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the standard input empty and the file object open(0) with no lines.
