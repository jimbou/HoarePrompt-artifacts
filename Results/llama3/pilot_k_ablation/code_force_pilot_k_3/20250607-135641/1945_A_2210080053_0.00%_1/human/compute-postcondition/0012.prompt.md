Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three space-separated integers a, b, and c, where a, b, and c are non-negative integers.
Code of the loop:
for line in [*open(0)][1:]:
    p, q, r = map(int, line.split())
    q += r
    print((p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus r, stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) has at least 1 line, line is the second line, and this is printed: (p - q // 3, -1)[r < q % 3]

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value plus twice the value of r, r is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) has at least 2 lines, and this is printed: a tuple containing the difference between p and the integer division of q by 3 if r is greater than or equal to the remainder of q divided by 3, otherwise -1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value plus three times the value of r, r is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, open(0) has at least 2 lines, and this is printed: a tuple containing the difference between p and the integer division of q by 3 if r is greater than or equal to the remainder of q divided by 3, otherwise -1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
