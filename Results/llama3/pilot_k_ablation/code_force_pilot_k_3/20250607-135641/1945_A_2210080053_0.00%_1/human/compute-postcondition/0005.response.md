The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the values of `p`, `q`, and `r` from the third line of `open(0)`, which is split into integers. The second line increments `q` by the value of `r`. 

Since `q` is equal to its original value plus `r`, and the second line increments `q` by `r` again, the final value of `q` will be its original value plus twice the value of `r`. The values of `p` and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value plus twice the value of r, r is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) has at least 2 lines**
