The code prints a tuple containing two values. The first value is the difference between p and the integer division of q by 3, and the second value is -1. However, the tuple is indexed by a conditional expression that checks if r is less than the remainder of q divided by 3. If the condition is true, the first element of the tuple is printed; otherwise, the second element is printed.

Output: **(p - q // 3 if r < q % 3 else -1)**
