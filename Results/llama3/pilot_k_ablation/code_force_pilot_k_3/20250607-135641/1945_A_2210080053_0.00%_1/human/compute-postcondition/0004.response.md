To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change.

The loop head is `for line in [*open(0)][1:]:`. The variables in the loop head are `line` and the file object `open(0)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `open(0)` has at least 1 line, and `line` is the second line. For the loop to execute again, `open(0)` must have at least 2 lines, and `line` must be the third line.

The other variables `p`, `q`, `r`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`p`, `q`, and `r` are integers, `q` is equal to its original value plus `r`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 2 lines, `line` is the third line**
