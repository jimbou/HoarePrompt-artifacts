To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the file object `open(0)` and the variable `line`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the file object `open(0)`. If the file object has at least 2 lines (since the loop starts from the second line `[1:]`), the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to the file object `open(0)` has at least 2 lines and `line` is now the second line.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `open(0)` has at least 2 lines, `line` is the second line**
