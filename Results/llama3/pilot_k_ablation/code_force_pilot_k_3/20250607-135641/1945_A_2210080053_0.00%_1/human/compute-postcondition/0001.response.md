Output State: **p, q, and r are integers, q is equal to its original value plus r, stdin contains multiple test cases, open(0) has at least 1 line, line is the second line**

The code first assigns the values of the second line of `open(0)` to `p`, `q`, and `r`. The second line increments `q` by the value of `r`. No other variables are affected.
