Output State: **p is an integer, q is an integer equal to its original value plus three times the value of r, r is an integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, open(0) has at least 2 lines, and this is printed: a tuple containing the difference between p and the integer division of q by 3 if r is greater than or equal to the remainder of q divided by 3, otherwise -1**

The first line assigns the values of `p`, `q`, and `r` from the first line of `open(0)`, which contains at least 3 lines. The second line increments `q` by the value of `r`, making `q` equal to its original value plus twice the value of `r` plus `r`, which is three times the value of `r`. The value of `p` remains unchanged. The value of `r` also remains unchanged. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, since one test case has been read. Open(0) has at least 2 lines, since one line has been read. The printed tuple contains the difference between `p` and the integer division of `q` by 3 if `r` is greater than or equal to the remainder of `q` divided by 3, otherwise -1.
