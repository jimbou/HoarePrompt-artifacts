Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, skipping the first line (which contains the number of test cases) and processing each subsequent line as a test case.
2. For each test case, the program calculates the sum of the number of extroverts (b) and universals (c), which represents the total number of people who can be accommodated in tents with three people.
3. The program then calculates the difference between the number of introverts (a) and the integer division of the sum by 3. This represents the minimum number of tents needed to accommodate the introverts and the remaining people who can be accommodated in tents with three people.
4. The program checks if the number of universals (c) is greater than or equal to the remainder of the sum divided by 3. If this condition is true, it means that there are enough universals to fill the remaining tents with three people. In this case, the program prints the calculated difference.
5. If the condition is false, it means that there are not enough universals to fill the remaining tents with three people, and therefore it is impossible to accommodate all participants according to their preferences. In this case, the program prints -1.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
