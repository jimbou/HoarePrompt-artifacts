#Overall this is what the function does:This function simulates a game where players and a ball move around a grid, scoring points when the ball reaches a goal or a player catches a golden snitch. The game starts with an initial grid configuration, player positions, and goal locations. The function then reads a series of commands from standard input, which can be either movement commands for the ball or special commands to catch the golden snitch or score a goal. The function updates the game state accordingly, keeping track of player positions, ball position, and scores. Finally, it prints the final score after all commands have been processed.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: pos is a pair of integers representing a position on the field, and goal is a list of two lists of pairs of integers, where each pair represents a goal position on the field, with the first list containing the red goals and the second list containing the blue goals.
    res = 0 if pos in goal[0] else 1 if pos in goal[1] else -1
    return res
    #The program returns the value of `res`, which is 0 if the position `pos` is in the red goals, 1 if the position `pos` is in the blue goals, and -1 otherwise.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines the goal status of a given position on a field. It checks if the position is in the red goals, blue goals, or neither, and returns a corresponding value: 0 for red goals, 1 for blue goals, and -1 for no goal.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: el is a string of length 2, where the first character is either 'B', 'R', or '.', and the second character is either a digit (0-9) or 'G' or 'Q'.
    res = (el[0] == 'B' or el[0] == 'R') and el[1] != 'G'
    return res
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the first character of the string 'el' is either 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G'.

#Overall this is what the function does:Determines whether a given 2-character string meets specific conditions, returning True if the first character is 'B' or 'R' and the second character is not 'G', and False otherwise.
