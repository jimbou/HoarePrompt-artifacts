This function simulates a game where players and a ball move around a grid, scoring points when the ball reaches a goal or a player catches a golden snitch. The game starts with an initial grid configuration, player positions, and goal locations. The function then reads a series of commands from standard input, which can be either movement commands for the ball or special commands to catch the golden snitch or score a goal. The function updates the game state accordingly, keeping track of player positions, ball position, and scores. Finally, it prints the final score after all commands have been processed.
