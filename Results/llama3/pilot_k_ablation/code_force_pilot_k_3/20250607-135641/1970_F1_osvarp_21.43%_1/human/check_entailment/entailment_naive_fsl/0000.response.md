Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when a player scores in the wrong goal. According to the problem description, if a player scores in the wrong goal, the other team wins a point. However, the program does not check for this case and instead only checks if the player is in the correct goal.

For example, if the input is:

5 5
.. R1 .. B1 ..
RG .. .. .. BG
RG R0 .Q B0 BG
RG .. .. .. BG
.. R2 .. B2 ..
13
B2 U
B2 U
B2 L
B2 C .Q
B2 L
B2 L
B2 T
R0 R
R0 C .Q
R0 D
R0 R
R0 R
R0 T

The program will output:

6 BLUE GOAL
12 RED GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 1 1

However, the correct output should be:

6 BLUE GOAL
12 BLUE GOAL
FINAL SCORE: 0 2

Because the red player R0 scored in the red goal, which is the wrong goal, so the blue team wins a point.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
