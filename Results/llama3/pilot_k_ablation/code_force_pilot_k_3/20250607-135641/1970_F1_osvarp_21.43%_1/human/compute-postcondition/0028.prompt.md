Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single list of strings, elements is a dictionary with a single key-value pair ('.B': (0, 0)), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two empty lists, points is a list with two elements, both 0, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input
Code of the loop:
for ind in range(len(line)):
    if line[ind] != '..':
        elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
        if isPlayer(line[ind]):
            allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
        elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
            tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
            goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs ('.B': (0, 0) and `line[ind]`: (`i`, `ind`)), `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` has at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair (`line[ind]`: False) and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is not a player, then `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary and if the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind), otherwise `goal` is a list of two empty lists. In both cases, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` has at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1, and `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` has three key-value pairs, and if `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is not 'G', then the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single list of strings, elements is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input, line has at least 2 characters, ind is 2, points is a list with two elements, both 0. If line[ind] is not '..', then elements[line[2]] is (0, 2). If line[ind] is a player, then allPlayers[line[2]] is False. If line[ind] is not a player and line[ind][1] is 'G', then tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on whether line[ind][0] is 'B' or not, and goal[tmp] has an additional element (i, ind).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
