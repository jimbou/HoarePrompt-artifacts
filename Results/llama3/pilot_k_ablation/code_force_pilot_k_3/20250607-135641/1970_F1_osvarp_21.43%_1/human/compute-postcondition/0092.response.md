Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and True as the value for the player 'Q', otherwise False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0. `obj`, `com`, `el` are assigned the first, second and third string from the list `comand` respectively. stdin is empty. The current value of `el` is '.Q'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `allPlayers[obj]` is now set to True, where `obj` is the first string from the list `comand`. All other variables remain unchanged.
