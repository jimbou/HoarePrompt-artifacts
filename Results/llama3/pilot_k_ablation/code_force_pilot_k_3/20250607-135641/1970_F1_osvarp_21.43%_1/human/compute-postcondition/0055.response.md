Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for the character at index `ind` is now (i, ind) if the character at index `ind` in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements`. `i` is 1, `line` has at least 2 characters, `ind` is 2, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index `ind` in the line is a player, then the player at index `ind` in the line is now set to False. If the character at index `ind` in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`.***
