Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and True as the value for the player 'Q' if `el` is '.Q', otherwise False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 2. `comand` is a list of strings read from stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `elements[obj]`. `obj`, `com`, `el` are the first, second and third elements of `comand` respectively. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is now True. If `el` is '.S', then `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` == 'B' else 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10, and the following is printed: '%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]), where time is 2 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team, which is either 'BLUE' or 'RED' depending on the value of team. Otherwise, no changes are made to `points[team]` and no message is printed. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then the program executes the if block when the object is '.B', updating the elements dictionary, printing elimination messages, and potentially scoring goals. If the object is not '.B', the program does not execute the if block, and the elements dictionary remains unchanged. stdin is now empty.**
