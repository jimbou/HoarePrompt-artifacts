Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `t` is an integer read from the empty stdin, which is not possible, so `t` is undefined. Stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for time in range(t):
    comand = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    if len(comand) == 3:
        obj, com, el = comand
        if el == '.Q':
            allPlayers[obj] = True
        elif el == '.S':
            team = 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0
            points[team] += 10
            print('%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]))
    else:
        obj, com = comand
        pos = elements[obj]
        nxt = pos[0] + mov[com][0], pos[1] + mov[com][1]
        if obj == '.B' and isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]) or isPlayer(obj
            ) and elements['.B'] == nxt:
            player = obj if isPlayer(obj) else grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]
            print('%d %s ELIMINATED' % (time, player))
        elif com == 'T':
            allPlayers[obj] = False
            if goalIn(pos) != -1:
                team = goalIn(pos)
                print('%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]))
                points[team] += 1
        elif isPlayer(obj):
            elements[obj] = nxt
        if obj == '.B':
            elements[obj] = nxt


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and True as the value for the player 'Q' if `el` is '.Q', otherwise False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0. If `len(comand)` is 3, then `obj`, `com`, `el` are assigned the first, second and third string from the list `comand` respectively. stdin is empty. If `el` is not '.Q', then `points` is a list with two elements, the first element is 10 and the second element is 0 if `el` is '.S', otherwise `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. If `el` is '.S', then "0 [GoalName[team]] CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH" is printed. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then `points` is a list with two elements, one of which is 1 and the other is 0 if goalIn(pos) != -1 and com == 'T', otherwise `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0. `comand` is a list of strings read from the empty stdin and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3. `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `elements[obj]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and True as the value for the player 'Q' if `el` is '.Q', otherwise False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 1. If `len(comand)` is 3, then `comand` is a list of strings, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `elements[obj]`. `obj`, `com`, `el` are the first, second and third elements of `comand` respectively. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is now True. If `el` is '.S', then `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` == 'B' else 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10, and the following is printed: '%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]), where time is 1 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team, which is either 'BLUE' or 'RED' depending on the value of team. Otherwise, no changes are made to `points[team]` and no message is printed. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then the program executes the if block when the object is '.B', updating the elements dictionary, printing elimination messages, and potentially scoring goals. If the object is not '.B', the program does not execute the if block, and the elements dictionary remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is `(i, ind)` if the character at index `ind` in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements`, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and `True` as the value for the player 'Q' if `el` is '.Q', otherwise `False` as the value, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`. If `len(comand)` is 3, then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt` if `obj` is '.B', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements[obj]`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` == 'B' else 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10 if `el` is '.S', otherwise no changes have been made to `points[team]` and no message is printed, and this is printed: '2 BLUE CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' if `el` is '.S'. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is now True. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then if `obj` == '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or (`isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B']` == `nxt`), then `player` is printed: '2 [player] ELIMINATED'. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `points[team]` is increased by 11 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `points[team]` is increased by 10 if `el` is '.S', otherwise no changes have been made to `points[team]`, and the following is printed: '%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]) if `el` is '.S', otherwise no changes have been made to `points[team]` and no message is printed, `team` is now the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, and this is printed: '%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]) where time is 2 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team with the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1. If `obj` is a player, then the above changes are made, otherwise no changes are made. If `obj` is not '.B', then no changes have been made to the state of the program. stdin is now empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
