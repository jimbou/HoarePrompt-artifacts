Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is `(i, ind)` if the character at index `ind` in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements`, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and `True` as the value for the player 'Q' if `el` is '.Q', otherwise `False` as the value, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`, `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`. If `len(comand)` is 3, then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt` if `obj` is '.B', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements[obj]`, `team` is 1 if `obj[0]` == 'B' else 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10 if `el` is '.S', otherwise no changes have been made to `points[team]` and no message is printed, and this is printed: '2 BLUE CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' if `el` is '.S'. If `el` is '.Q', then `allPlayers[obj]` is now True. If `len(comand)` is not 3, then if `obj` == '.B' and `isPlayer(grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]])` or (`isPlayer(obj)` and `elements['.B']` == `nxt`), then `player` is printed: '2 [player] ELIMINATED'. Otherwise, if `com` is 'T', then `points[team]` is increased by 11 if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, `points[team]` is increased by 10 if `el` is '.S', otherwise no changes have been made to `points[team]`, and the following is printed: '%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]) if `el` is '.S', otherwise no changes have been made to `points[team]` and no message is printed, `team` is now the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1, and this is printed: '%d %s GOAL' % (time, GoalName[team]) where time is 2 and GoalName[team] is the name of the goal for the team with the value returned by `goalIn(pos)` if `goalIn(pos)` is not -1. If `obj` is a player, then the above changes are made, otherwise no changes are made. If `obj` is not '.B', then no changes have been made to the state of the program. stdin is now empty.***
