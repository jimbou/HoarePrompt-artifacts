Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing three lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (2, 1) if the character at index 1 in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is 2, `ind` is 1, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value, where the player at index 1 in the line is now set to False. If the character at index 1 in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. If the character at index 1 in the line is a player, then `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (2, 1) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (2, 1). Stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the player at index 1 in the line is now set to False in the `allPlayers` dictionary. The `tmp` variable is updated based on the character at index 1 in the line and the first character of the line. The `goal` dictionary is also updated based on the character at index 1 in the line and the first character of the line.
