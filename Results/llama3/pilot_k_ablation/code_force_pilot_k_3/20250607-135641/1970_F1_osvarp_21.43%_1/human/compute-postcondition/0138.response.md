Output: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is `(i, ind)` if the character at index `ind` in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements`, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and `False` as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`. `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 1. `comand` is a list of strings read from the empty stdin, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`. `elements[obj]` is now `nxt` if `obj` is '.B', otherwise no changes are made to `elements[obj]`. `player` is `obj` if `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, otherwise `player` is `grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]]`, and the following is printed: '[time] [player] ELIMINATED' where time is 1 and player is either obj if isPlayer(obj) is True, otherwise grid[nxt[0]][nxt[1]].**
