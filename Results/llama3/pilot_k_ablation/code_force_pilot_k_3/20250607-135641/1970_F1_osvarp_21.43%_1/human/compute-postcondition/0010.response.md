Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single list of strings, elements is a dictionary with two key-value pairs ('.B': (0, 0) and line[ind]: (i, ind)), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, points is a list with two elements, both 0, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input, line has at least 1 character, ind is 0, goal is a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind).**

The code snippet assigns a value to `tmp` based on the first character of `line[ind]`. If the first character is 'B', `tmp` becomes 0; otherwise, it becomes 1. Then, it appends the tuple `(i, ind)` to the `tmp`-th list in `goal`. Since `line[ind][0]` is not 'B' and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', `tmp` becomes 1, and the tuple `(i, ind)` is appended to the second list in `goal`. No other variables are affected.
