Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing n lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, i is n-1, ind is equal to the length of the line minus 1, points is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, allPlayers contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, goal contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then tmp is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to tmp. line must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. Stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has executed n times, where n is a positive odd integer between 3 and 99. The grid now contains n lists of strings, each representing a line of input. The elements dictionary has been updated to include key-value pairs for each character in the lines, where the value is the index of the character in the line if the character is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made. The variable i is now equal to n-1, and ind is equal to the length of the line minus 1. The points list still contains two elements, both 0. For each character in the lines that is a player, the allPlayers dictionary contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the lines that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, the goal list contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then tmp is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to tmp. The line must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop, and stdin is now empty.
