Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing n lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is n-1, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value for the player 'Q' if el is '.Q', otherwise False as the value, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind), `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `time` is 2, `obj` is the first element of comand, `com` is the second element of comand, `pos` is the value of elements[obj], `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of pos and the first element of mov[com], and the sum of the second element of pos and the second element of mov[com], `elements[obj]` is now nxt if obj is '.B', otherwise no changes have been made to elements[obj], `obj`, `com`, `el` are the first, second and third elements of comand respectively, `team` is 1 if obj[0] == 'B' else 0, `points[team]` is increased by 10, and the following is printed: '%d %s CATCH GOLDEN SNITCH' % (time, GoalName[team]) if el is '.S', otherwise no changes have been made to points[team] and no message is printed, `team` is now the value returned by `goalIn(pos)`, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the value of `team` has been updated to the value returned by the function `goalIn(pos)`.
