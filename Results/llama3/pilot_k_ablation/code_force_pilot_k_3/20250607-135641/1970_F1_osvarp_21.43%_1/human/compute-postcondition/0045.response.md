Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing two lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, i is 1, stdin has no lines of input, line has at least 1 character, ind is 1, points is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, allPlayers contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, goal contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is not '..', then elements includes the current character at index ind with value (1, 1), and if the character is a player, it has been set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, then tmp is 1 if the first character of the line is not 'B', otherwise tmp is 0, and goal[tmp] contains the tuple (i, ind). tmp is 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1, and goal[tmp] contains the tuple (i, ind).**

The code modifies the value of tmp and appends a tuple to goal[tmp]. The value of tmp is determined by the first character of the line at index ind. If the first character is 'B', tmp is set to 0; otherwise, it is set to 1. The tuple (i, ind) is then appended to goal[tmp]. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
