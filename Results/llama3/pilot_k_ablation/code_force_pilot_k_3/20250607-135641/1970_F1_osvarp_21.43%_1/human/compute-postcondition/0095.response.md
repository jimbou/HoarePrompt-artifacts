Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing n lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, i is n-1, ind is equal to the length of the line minus 1, points is a list with two elements, the first element is 10 and the second element is 0, allPlayers contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value for each character in the line that is a player, goal contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind) for each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, tmp is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1 if the character at index ind in the line is 'G', t is greater than 0, time is 0, obj, com, el are assigned the first, second and third string from the list comand respectively, stdin is empty, el is not equal to '.Q', and el is '.S'.**

The code block assigns the value 1 to the variable `team` if the first character of the string `obj` is 'B', otherwise it assigns 0 to `team`. Then, it increments the value of the `team`-th element of the list `points` by 10. Since `el` is '.S', the first character of `obj` is 'B', so `team` is 1. Therefore, the first element of `points` is incremented by 10, making it 10. The second element of `points` remains 0. No other variables are affected by the code block.
