Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (i, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `points` is a list with two elements, one of which is 1 and the other is 0, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind), `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0, `comand` is a list of strings read from the empty stdin and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`.**

The code increments the score of the team that scored a goal by 1. The team that scored the goal is determined by the value of `goalIn(pos)`, which is stored in the variable `team`. The score of the team is stored in the list `points` at index `team`. The value of `points[team]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
