Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs ('.B': (0, 0) and `line[ind]`: (`i`, `ind`)), `allPlayers` is an empty dictionary, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` has at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. If the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind). Otherwise, `goal` is a list of two empty lists.***
