Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single list of strings, elements is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input, line has at least 2 characters, ind is 2, points is a list with two elements, both 0, elements[line[2]] is (0, 2), tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on whether line[ind][0] is 'B' or not, and goal[tmp] has an additional element (i, ind).**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `i`, `stdin`, `line`, `ind`, and `points` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `tmp` is determined based on the condition `line[ind][0] == 'B'`, and `goal[tmp]` is updated with the new element `(i, ind)`.
