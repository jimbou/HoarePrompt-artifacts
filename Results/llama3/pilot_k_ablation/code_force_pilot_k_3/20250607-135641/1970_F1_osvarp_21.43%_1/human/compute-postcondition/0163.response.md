The code prints a formatted string indicating that a player has been eliminated. The string includes the current time and the name of the eliminated player.

The time is given by the variable `time`, which is 2.

The player is given by the variable `player`, which is either the object `obj` if `obj` is a player (i.e., `isPlayer(obj)` is True), or the string at position `nxt` in the grid if `obj` is not a player.

Since `obj` is the first element of `comand`, and `comand` is a list of three elements, `obj` is either '.B' or '.Q' (because `el` is '.Q' if `obj` is '.B', and vice versa).

If `obj` is '.B', then `player` is `obj`, which is '.B'.

If `obj` is '.Q', then `player` is the string at position `nxt` in the grid. Since `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`, `nxt` is a position in the grid that is adjacent to the position of `obj`.

Therefore, the output will be a string indicating that a player has been eliminated, with the current time (2) and the name of the eliminated player (either '.B' or the string at an adjacent position in the grid).

Output: **2 .B ELIMINATED** or **2 [string at adjacent position in grid] ELIMINATED**
