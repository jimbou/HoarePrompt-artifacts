Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for the character at index `ind` is now (i, ind), `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` has at least 2 characters, `ind` is 2, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind).**

In this output state, the only change is that the value of `elements[line[ind]]` has been updated to `(i, ind)`, which is `(1, 2)`. All other variables remain unchanged.
