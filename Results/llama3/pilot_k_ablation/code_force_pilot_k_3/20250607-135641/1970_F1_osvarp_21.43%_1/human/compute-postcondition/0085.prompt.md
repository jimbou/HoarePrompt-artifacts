Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and m are positive odd integers such that 3 <= n, m <= 99, grid is an empty list, elements is a dictionary with a single key-value pair ('.B': (0, 0)), allPlayers is an empty dictionary, goal is a list of two empty lists, points is a list with two elements, both 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    line = stdin.readline().strip().split()
    grid.append(line)
    for ind in range(len(line)):
        if line[ind] != '..':
            elements[line[ind]] = i, ind
            if isPlayer(line[ind]):
                allPlayers[line[ind]] = False
            elif line[ind][1] == 'G':
                tmp = 0 if line[ind][0] == 'B' else 1
                goal[tmp].append((i, ind))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single list of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input, line has at least as many characters as the length of the line, ind is equal to the length of the line minus 1, points is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, allPlayers contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, goal contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (1, ind) if the character at index `ind` in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements`. `i` is 1, `line` has at least as many characters as the length of the line, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index `ind` in the line is a player, then the player at index `ind` in the line is now set to False. If the character at index `ind` in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing three lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (`i`, `ind`) if the character at index `ind` in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is 2, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (`i`, `ind`) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (`i`, `ind`). If the character at index `ind` in the line is a player, then the player at index `ind` in the line is now set to False. If the character at index `ind` in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `line` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. Stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
