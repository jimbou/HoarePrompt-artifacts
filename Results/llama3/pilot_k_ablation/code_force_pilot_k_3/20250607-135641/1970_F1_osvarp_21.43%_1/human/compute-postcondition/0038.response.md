Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing two lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, including the current character at index ind with value (1, 0), i is 1, stdin has no lines of input, line has at least 1 character, ind is 0, points is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, allPlayers contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, goal contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (1, 0) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (1, 0). The character at index ind in the line is not a player. The current value of the second character of the line at index ind is 'G'. tmp is 1 if line[ind][0] is not 'B', otherwise tmp is 0. goal[tmp] contains the tuple (i, ind).**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as positive odd integers within the range of 3 to 99. The `grid` and `elements` dictionary also remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and `stdin` remains empty. The `line` still has at least one character, and `ind` is still 0. The `points` list continues to have two elements, both 0. The `allPlayers` dictionary remains unchanged, containing key-value pairs for each player character in the line with False as the value. The `goal` list is updated based on the value of `tmp`, which is determined by the first character of the line at index `ind`. If the first character is not 'B', `tmp` is 1, and the second list in `goal` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`. If the first character is 'B', `tmp` is 0, and the first list in `goal` contains the tuple `(i, ind)`.
