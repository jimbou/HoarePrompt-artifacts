Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing `n` lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is `(i, ind)` if the character at index `ind` in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to `elements`, `i` is `n-1`, `ind` is equal to the length of the line minus 1, `points` is a list with two elements, one of which is 1 and the other is 0 if goalIn(pos) != -1 and com == 'T', otherwise `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple `(i, ind)` if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple `(i, ind)`. If the character at index `ind` in the line is a player, then the player at index `ind` in the line is now set to False. If the character at index `ind` in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. `t` must be greater than 0, `time` is 0. `comand` is a list of strings read from the empty stdin and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3. `obj` is the first element of `comand`, `com` is the second element of `comand`, `pos` is the value of `elements[obj]`, `nxt` is a tuple containing the sum of the first element of `pos` and the first element of `mov[com]`, and the sum of the second element of `pos` and the second element of `mov[com]`. If `obj` is '.B', then `elements[obj]` is now `nxt`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `elements[obj]`.***
