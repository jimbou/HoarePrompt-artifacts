Postcondition: ***n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing a single list of strings, elements is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs, i is 0, stdin has one less line of input, line has at least 2 characters, ind is 2, points is a list with two elements, both 0, elements[line[2]] is (0, 2). If line[ind][1] is 'G', then tmp is either 0 or 1 depending on whether line[ind][0] is 'B' or not, and goal[tmp] has an additional element (i, ind).***
