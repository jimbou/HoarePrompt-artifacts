The `print` statement will print a string indicating that a player has been eliminated. The string will contain the current time and the player that has been eliminated.

The value of `time` is 1, as specified in the initial state.

The value of `player` depends on the value of `obj` and the result of the `isPlayer(obj)` function. If `isPlayer(obj)` is `True`, then `player` is equal to `obj`. Otherwise, `player` is equal to the character at the position `nxt` in the `grid`.

Since the exact value of `obj` and the result of `isPlayer(obj)` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `player`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the current time and the player that has been eliminated.

Output: **1 [player] ELIMINATED (where player is the player that has been eliminated, which is either obj or the character at position nxt in the grid)**
