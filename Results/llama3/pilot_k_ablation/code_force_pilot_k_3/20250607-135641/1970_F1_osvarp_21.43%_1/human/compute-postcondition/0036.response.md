Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing two lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, including the current character at index `ind` with value (1, 0), `i` is 1, `stdin` has no lines of input, `line` has at least 1 character, `ind` is 0, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (1, 0) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (1, 0). The character at index `ind` in the `line` is not a player.***
