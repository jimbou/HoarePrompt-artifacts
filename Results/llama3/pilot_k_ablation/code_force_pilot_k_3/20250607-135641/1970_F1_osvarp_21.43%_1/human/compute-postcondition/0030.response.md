Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing two lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, i is 1, stdin has no lines of input, line has at least as many characters as the length of the line, ind is equal to the length of the line minus 1, points is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, allPlayers contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, goal contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind).**

The code reads a line from stdin and strips it of leading and trailing whitespace, then splits it into a list of words. This list is then appended to the grid. The line is also stored in the variable line. The values of n, m, elements, i, ind, points, allPlayers, and goal are not modified by the code. The only changes are that stdin now has no lines of input, and grid now contains an additional list of strings.
