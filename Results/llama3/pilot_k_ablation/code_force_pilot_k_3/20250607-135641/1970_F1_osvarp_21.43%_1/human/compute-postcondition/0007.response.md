Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two key-value pairs ('.B': (0, 0) and `line[ind]`: (`i`, `ind`)), `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair (`line[ind]`: False), `goal` is a list of two empty lists, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` has at least 1 character, `ind` is 0. The current value of `line[ind]` is not '..' and it is a player.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `goal`, `points`, `i`, `stdin`, `line`, and `ind` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `allPlayers` now has one key-value pair, where the key is the current value of `line[ind]` (which is a player) and the value is `False`.
