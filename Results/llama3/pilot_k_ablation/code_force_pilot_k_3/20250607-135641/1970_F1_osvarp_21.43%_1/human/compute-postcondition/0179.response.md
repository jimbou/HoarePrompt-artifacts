Based on the precondition, the `points` list contains two elements, one of which is 1 and the other is 0 if `goalIn(pos)` != -1 and `com` == 'T', otherwise both elements are 0.

Since `comand` is a list of strings read from the empty stdin and the length of `comand` is not equal to 3, the `points` list will contain two elements, one of which is 1 and the other is 0 if `goalIn(pos)` != -1 and `com` == 'T', otherwise both elements are 0.

However, the exact values of `goalIn(pos)` and `com` are not provided in the precondition, so we cannot determine the exact values of `points[0]` and `points[1]`.

Output: **FINAL SCORE: [points[0]] [points[1]] (where points[0] and points[1] are the values of the points list, which are either 1 and 0 or both 0, depending on the values of goalIn(pos) and com)**
