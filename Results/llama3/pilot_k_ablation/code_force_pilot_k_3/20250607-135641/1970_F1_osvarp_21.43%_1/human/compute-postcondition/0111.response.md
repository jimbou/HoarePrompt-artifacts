Output: **0 [GoalName[team]] GOAL**.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the output:

1. `time`: The initial state specifies that `time` is 0. Therefore, the first part of the output will be `0`.

2. `GoalName[team]`: The initial state specifies that `team` is the value of `goalIn(pos)`, but it does not provide the exact value of `goalIn(pos)`. However, it does specify that `goalIn(pos)` is not -1. Therefore, `team` is a non-negative integer. The `GoalName` is an array or list that maps team numbers to their corresponding names. Since `team` is a non-negative integer, `GoalName[team]` will be the name of the team corresponding to the value of `team`.

3. `GOAL`: This is a literal string that is printed as part of the output.

Therefore, the output will be `0` followed by the name of the team corresponding to the value of `team`, followed by the string `GOAL`.
