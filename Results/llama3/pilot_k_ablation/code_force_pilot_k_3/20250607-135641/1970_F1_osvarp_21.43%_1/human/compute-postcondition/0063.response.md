Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing three lists of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (1, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, `i` is 2, `ind` is 0, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, `allPlayers` contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, `goal` contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then `tmp` is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise `tmp` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `tmp`. The current value of `line[ind]` is not '..'. `line` must have at least 1 character. Stdin is empty. `elements[line[ind]]` is now (2, 0). The current value of `line[ind]` is a player and is now set to False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `elements`, `i`, `ind`, `points`, `goal`, and `tmp` remain unchanged. The value of `allPlayers[line[ind]]` is now set to False, indicating that the player at index `ind` in the line is no longer available. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
