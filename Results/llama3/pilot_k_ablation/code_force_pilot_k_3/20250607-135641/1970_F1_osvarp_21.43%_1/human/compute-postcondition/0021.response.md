The only variable in the loop head is `ind`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ind` and `line`. If `ind` is less than the length of `line`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 1 and `line` has at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again, `ind` must be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` has at least 2 characters, `ind` is 2, and `points` is a list with two elements, both 0**
