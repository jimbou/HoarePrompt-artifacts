Postcondition: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` has at least 2 characters, `ind` is 1, and `points` is a list with two elements, both 0. If `line[ind]` is '..', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `line[ind]` is not '..', then `elements` has three key-value pairs, and if `line[ind]` is a player, then `allPlayers` is a dictionary with one key-value pair and `goal` is a list of two empty lists. If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is 'G', then `goal` is a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if `line[ind][0]` is 'B' otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If `line[ind]` is not a player and the second character of `line[ind]` is not 'G', then the state of the program remains unchanged.**
