Output State: **`n` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, `m` is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, `grid` is a list containing a single list of strings, `elements` is a dictionary with two or three key-value pairs, `i` is 0, `stdin` has one less line of input, `line` has at least 2 characters, `ind` is 2, `points` is a list with two elements, both 0, and `elements[line[2]]` is (0, 2)**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `grid`, `i`, `stdin`, `line`, `ind`, and `points` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `elements` dictionary, where a new key-value pair is added. The key is the character at index 2 of the `line` string, and the value is a tuple containing the current value of `i` (which is 0) and the current value of `ind` (which is 2).
