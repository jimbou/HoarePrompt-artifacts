Output State: **n is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= n <= 99, m is a positive odd integer such that 3 <= m <= 99, grid is a list containing three lists of strings, elements is a dictionary with key-value pairs for each character in the line, where the value for each character is (1, ind) if the character at index ind in the line is not '..', otherwise no changes have been made to elements, i is 2, ind is 0, points is a list with two elements, both 0. For each character in the line that is a player, allPlayers contains a key-value pair with the player as the key and False as the value. For each character in the line that is not a player and has 'G' as its second character, goal contains a list of two lists, one of which contains the tuple (i, ind) if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise the other list contains the tuple (i, ind). If the character at index ind in the line is a player, then the player at index ind in the line is now set to False. If the character at index ind in the line is 'G', then tmp is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to tmp. The current value of line[ind] is not '..'. line must have at least 1 character. Stdin is empty. elements[line[ind]] is now (2, 0). The character at index ind in the line is not a player. The second character of the current value of line[ind] is 'G'. tmp is 0 if the first character of the line is 'B', otherwise tmp is 1. goal[tmp] contains the tuple (i, ind).**
