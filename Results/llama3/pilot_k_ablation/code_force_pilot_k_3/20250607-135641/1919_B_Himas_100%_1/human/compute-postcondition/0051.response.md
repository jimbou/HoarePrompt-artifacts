Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a string equal to the second input that has at least three characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If `q` is '+', then `P` was initially 2 and is now 3. If `q` is not '+', then `P` was initially 0 and is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
