To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key elements here are `i` and the `range` object generated by `int(input())`.

1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

2. **`int(input())`**: This part of the loop head is crucial because it determines the total number of iterations. Since `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, and we've already completed one iteration, we need to ensure there are enough test cases left for the loop to execute again. Thus, `stdin` should contain multiple test cases minus four for the loop to proceed.

3. **Other variables (`s`, `e`, `P`, `M`)**: These variables are not part of the loop head, so their states do not directly influence whether the loop can execute again. However, it's worth noting that the loop body (not shown) might modify these variables based on the input and the logic of the program.

Given this analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer, `e` is an empty string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`.**
