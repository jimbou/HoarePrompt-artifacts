Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a string equal to the second input that has at least two characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.***
