Output State: **i is 0, s is a positive integer, e is a string, P is the number of '+' characters in the string e, M is the number of '-' characters in the string e, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` remains 0, `s` remains a positive integer, `e` remains a string, `P` becomes the total number of '+' characters in the string `e`, `M` becomes the total number of '-' characters in the string `e`, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
