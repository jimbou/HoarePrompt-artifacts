To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head `for q in e:`. The only variables in the loop head are `q` and `e`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and `e` is a string equal to the second input that is not empty.

For the loop to execute again, `e` must have at least one more character. Since `q` is the first character in `e`, we need to move to the next character in `e` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `q` should be the second character in `e`.

The other variables `i`, `s`, `stdin`, `P`, and `M` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a string equal to the second input that has at least two characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 1.**
