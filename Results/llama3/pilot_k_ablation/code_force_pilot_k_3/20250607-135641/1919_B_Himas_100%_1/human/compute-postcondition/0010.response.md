Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 1. Otherwise, `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `M` is now 1. Otherwise, `M` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
