Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `P` is either 2 or 1, `M` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is now 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is now 1 and `M` is 1. The values of `i`, `s`, `e`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
