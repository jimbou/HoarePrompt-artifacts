Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.***
