Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
