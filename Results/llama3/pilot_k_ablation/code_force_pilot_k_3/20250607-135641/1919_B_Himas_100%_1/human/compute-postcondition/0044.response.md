Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a string equal to the second input that is not empty, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and `q` is not '+'**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `M` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged, with `i` still being 2, `s` still being an integer equal to the first input, `e` still being a string equal to the second input that is not empty, `P` still being 0, and `q` still being the first character in the string `e` that is not '+'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
