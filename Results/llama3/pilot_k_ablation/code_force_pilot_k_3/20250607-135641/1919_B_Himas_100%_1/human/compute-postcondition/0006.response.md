Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `P` is 0, `M` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `q` is the first character in the string `e` and `q` is not '+'**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `M` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing multiple test cases minus one.
