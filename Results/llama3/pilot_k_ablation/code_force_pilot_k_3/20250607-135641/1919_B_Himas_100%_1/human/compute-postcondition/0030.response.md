Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. If the second character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.***
