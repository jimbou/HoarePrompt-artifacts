Output State: **`i` is 0, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 1 character and its first character is `q`, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, `q` is '+', stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The string `e` still has at least 1 character and its first character is still `q`, which is equal to '+'. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
