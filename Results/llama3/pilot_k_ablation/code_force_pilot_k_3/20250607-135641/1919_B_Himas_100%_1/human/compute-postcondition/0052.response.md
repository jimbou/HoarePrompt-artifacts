Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a string equal to the second input that has at least three characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3**

The code increments the value of `M` by 1. Since the initial state specifies that if `q` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0, and if `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2, the updated values of `M` will be 1 and 3 respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
