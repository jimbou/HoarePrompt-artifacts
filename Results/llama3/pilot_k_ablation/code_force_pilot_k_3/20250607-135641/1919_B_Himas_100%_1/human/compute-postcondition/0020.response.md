Output State: **i is 1, s is an integer, e is a string, P is 0, M is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**

The code executes as follows:

1. `s = int(input())`: This line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `s`. Since `s` was previously a positive integer, its value is updated to the newly read integer. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.

2. `e = input()`: This line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `e`. The previous value of `e` is overwritten with the new string.

3. `P = 0` and `M = 0`: These lines reset the values of `P` and `M` to 0. The previous values of `P` and `M`, which represented the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`, are lost.

After the code executes, the final state is:

* `i` remains unchanged at 1.
* `s` is updated to the newly read integer.
* `e` is updated to the newly read string.
* `P` and `M` are reset to 0.
* Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.

Note that the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters (`P`) and the number of '-' characters (`M`) in the string `e` is no longer being printed, as the code does not include any print statements.
