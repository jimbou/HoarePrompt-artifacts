Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the third character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 1. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `M` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `P` and `M` based on the third character `q` in the string `e` are still valid, but the value of `M` has been updated accordingly.
