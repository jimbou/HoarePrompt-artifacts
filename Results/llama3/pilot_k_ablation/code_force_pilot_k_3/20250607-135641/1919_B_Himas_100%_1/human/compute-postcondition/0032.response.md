Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If the third character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1. If the third character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is now 3. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
