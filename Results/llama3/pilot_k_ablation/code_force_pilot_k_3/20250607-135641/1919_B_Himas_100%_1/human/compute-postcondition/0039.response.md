Output State: **i is 2, s is an integer equal to the first input, e is a string equal to the second input, P is 0, M is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

The code first reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `s`, which was previously an integer. The second line reads a string from stdin and assigns it to `e`, which was previously an empty string. The third and fourth lines assign 0 to `P` and `M`, respectively, which were previously the number of '+' and '-' characters in the original string `e`. Since `e` is now a new string, `P` and `M` are reset to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two.
