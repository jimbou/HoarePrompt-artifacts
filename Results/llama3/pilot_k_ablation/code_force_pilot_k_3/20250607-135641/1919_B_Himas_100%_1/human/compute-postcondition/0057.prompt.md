Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 5000) and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting of characters "+" and "-".
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    s = int(input())
    e = input()
    P = 0
    M = 0
    for q in e:
        if q == '+':
            P += 1
        else:
            M += 1
    print(abs(P - M))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, s is a positive integer, e is a string, P is the number of '+' characters in the string e, M is the number of '-' characters in the string e, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters (P) and the number of '-' characters (M) in the string e is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is an empty string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `P` is the number of '+' characters in the original string `e`, and `M` is the number of '-' characters in the original string `e`, and the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and '-' characters in the original string `e` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is 2, s is an integer equal to the first input, e is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, P is equal to the number of '+' characters in the string e, M is equal to the number of '-' characters in the string e, and the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and '-' characters in the string e is printed, which is 0 since e is an empty string




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
