Output State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, `P` is either 3 if `q` is '+', or 1 if `q` is not '+', `M` is either 0 if `q` is '+', or 2 if `q` is not '+', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 3 if the third character `q` in the string `e` is '+', or 1 if `q` is not '+'. The value of `M` remains the same, either 0 if `q` is '+', or 2 if `q` is not '+'. The other variables `i`, `s`, `e`, and `q` are not affected by the code, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
