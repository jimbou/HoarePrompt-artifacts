To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for q in e:`, where `q` is the loop variable and `e` is the iterable.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `q` is the second character in the string `e`, and `e` must have at least 2 characters.

For the loop to execute again, `e` must have at least 3 characters, and `q` must be the third character in the string `e`.

The other variables `i`, `s`, `stdin`, `P`, and `M` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 1, `s` is an integer, `e` is a non-empty string that must have at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `q` is the third character in the string `e`. If the third character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2.**
