According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `e`. If `e` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `e` has at least 2 characters, `q` is the second character in the string `e`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string `e` must have at least 3 characters and `q` is the third character in the string `e`. Also, `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1.
State: **`i` is 1, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the third character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 2 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 2. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 1.**
