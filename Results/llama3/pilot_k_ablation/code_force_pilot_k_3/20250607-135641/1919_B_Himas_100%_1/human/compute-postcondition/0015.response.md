Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `s` is a positive integer, `e` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `q` is the third character in the string `e`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the third character `q` in the string `e` is '+', then `P` is 3 and `M` is 0. If `q` is not '+', then `P` is 0 and `M` is 3. Otherwise, `P` is 1 and `M` is 2.***
