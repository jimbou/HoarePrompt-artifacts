Output State: **`i` is 2, `s` is an integer equal to the first input, `e` is a string equal to the second input that is not empty, `P` is 1, `M` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `q` is the first character in the string `e`, and the current value of `q` is '+'**.

In this output state, the value of `P` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The first character of the string `e` is still '+'.
