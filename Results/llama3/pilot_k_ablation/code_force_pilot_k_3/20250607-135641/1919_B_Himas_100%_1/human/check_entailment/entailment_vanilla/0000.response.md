Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program defines a function `func` that reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` and the string `e` itself. It then initializes two variables `P` and `M` to 0, which will be used to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.

The program then iterates over each character in the string `e`. If the character is '+', it increments `P` by 1, and if the character is '-', it increments `M` by 1.

Finally, the program prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`, which represents the minimum possible penalty.

The reasoning behind this program is as follows:

* The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.
* The sum of a subarray can be either positive or negative, depending on the number of '+' and '-' characters it contains.
* The absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the entire string represents the minimum possible penalty, because it is the smallest possible sum that can be achieved by splitting the array into subarrays.
* By counting the number of '+' and '-' characters separately, the program can calculate the absolute difference between them, which gives the minimum possible penalty.

Correctness: **True**
