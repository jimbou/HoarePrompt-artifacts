Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the minimum possible penalty as described in the problem statement. The program iterates over each test case, reads the length of the string and the string itself, and then calculates the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters. This difference represents the minimum possible penalty, as it is the absolute value of the sum of the array elements multiplied by the length of the array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible inputs as described in the problem statement. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, processing all test cases and printing the correct results.

Correctness: **True**
