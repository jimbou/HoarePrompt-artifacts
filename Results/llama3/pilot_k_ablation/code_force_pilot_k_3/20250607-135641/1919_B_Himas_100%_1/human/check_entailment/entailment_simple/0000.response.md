Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `i` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `s` (which is not used anywhere in the program, but that's okay because the length of the string is already known from the input).
3. It reads the string `e` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
4. It initializes two counters `P` and `M` to 0, which will count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `e`, respectively.
5. It iterates over each character `q` in the string `e`. If `q` is '+', it increments `P`. If `q` is '-', it increments `M`.
6. Finally, it prints the absolute difference between `P` and `M`, which is the minimum possible penalty.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem statement. The minimum possible penalty is indeed the absolute difference between the number of '+' characters and '-' characters in the string. The program does not need to split the string into subarrays or calculate the sum of penalties of subarrays because the problem statement guarantees that the optimal solution is to split the string into subarrays of length 1, and the penalty of each subarray is simply the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length (which is 1 in this case).

Correctness: **True**
