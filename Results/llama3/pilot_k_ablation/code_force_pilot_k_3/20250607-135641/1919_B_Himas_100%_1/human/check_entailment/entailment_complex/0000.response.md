Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself.
3. It initializes two counters, `P` and `M`, to count the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string, respectively.
4. It iterates over each character in the string and increments the corresponding counter (`P` for '+' and `M` for '-').
5. Finally, it prints the absolute difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters, which is the minimum possible penalty.

The program correctly implements the problem description and produces the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
