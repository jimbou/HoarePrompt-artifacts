Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of '+' and '-' characters in the input string and then printing the absolute difference between these counts. This is because the penalty of a single array is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, and the optimal way to split the array is to group all '+' characters together and all '-' characters together. The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the input string contains only '+' or only '-' characters.
