This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It calculates the average of these integers and checks if it's possible to redistribute the integers such that each integer is equal to the average. If this is possible for all test cases, it prints 'YES' for each test case; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
