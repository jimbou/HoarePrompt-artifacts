Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers representing the amounts of water in the containers.
2.  It calculates the total amount of water and the target amount for each container by dividing the total water by `n`. This is correct because the problem states that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
3.  The program then iterates through the containers and checks if it's possible to redistribute the water such that each container has the target amount. It does this by maintaining a `current_balance` variable, which represents the amount of water that needs to be poured into the current container to reach the target amount.
4.  If at any point the `current_balance` becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to pour into the current container, so the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
5.  Finally, the program prints 'YES' if it's possible to redistribute the water for all test cases and 'NO' otherwise.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
