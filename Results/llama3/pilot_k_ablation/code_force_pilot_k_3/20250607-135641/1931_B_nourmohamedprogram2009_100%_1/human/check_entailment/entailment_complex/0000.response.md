Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, calculates the average of the integers in each test case, and checks if it's possible to redistribute the integers such that each integer is equal to the average. The program uses a greedy approach to check if it's possible to redistribute the integers, which is correct because the problem allows pouring water from one container to another as long as the index of the source container is less than the index of the destination container. The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the integers in a test case is not divisible by the number of integers, which is guaranteed not to happen according to the problem statement.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. It also handles edge cases correctly, such as when the number of integers in a test case is 1, in which case the program correctly prints 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
