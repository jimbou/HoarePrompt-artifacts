Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It calculates the total amount of water and the target amount for each container.
2. It iterates through the containers, keeping track of the current balance (the difference between the current container's water and the target amount).
3. If the current balance ever becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so it sets `possible` to `False`.
4. If `possible` is still `True` after iterating through all containers, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, and it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
* When the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers, and it is not possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
* When there are containers with zero water, and it is still possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.
* When there are containers with water greater than the target amount, and it is still possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately implements the logic to solve the problem.
