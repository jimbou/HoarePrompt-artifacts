Postcondition: ***t is an integer and is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is increased by a[i] - target, i is at least 3, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the updated current_balance is negative, then possible is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
