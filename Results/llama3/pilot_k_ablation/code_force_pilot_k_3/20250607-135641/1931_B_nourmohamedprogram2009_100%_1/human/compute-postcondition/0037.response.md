Output State: **n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 3, _ is 2, t is at least 2, current_balance is increased by a[3] - target, possible is False, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed within. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the output state.

The initial state provides information about several variables: `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, `_`, `t`, `current_balance`, and `possible`. The code snippet only modifies the value of `possible`, setting it to `False`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state includes all the variables from the initial state, with only the value of `possible` updated to `False`.
