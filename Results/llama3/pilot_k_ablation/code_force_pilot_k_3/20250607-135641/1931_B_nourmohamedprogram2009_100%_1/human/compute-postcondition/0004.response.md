Output State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to `a[0] - target`, which is the difference between the first element of the list `a` and the target value. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has processed the first element of the list `a` and updated the `current_balance` accordingly.
