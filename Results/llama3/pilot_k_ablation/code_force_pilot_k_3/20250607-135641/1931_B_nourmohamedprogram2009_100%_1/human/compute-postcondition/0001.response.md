According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it more precise, we can adjust the state of `t` to be at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.**
