Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    current_balance = 0
    possible = True
    for i in range(n):
        current_balance += a[i] - target
        if current_balance < 0:
            possible = False
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer and is at least 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is increased by a[i] - target for all i in range(n). If the updated current_balance is non-negative, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is n, _ is 2, t is at least 2, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the sum of a[j] - target for all j in range(n) is not less than 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is n, _ is 1, t is at least 3, stdin contains 0 test cases, current_balance is the sum of the integers in a minus n times the target. If current_balance is not less than 0 at any point, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
