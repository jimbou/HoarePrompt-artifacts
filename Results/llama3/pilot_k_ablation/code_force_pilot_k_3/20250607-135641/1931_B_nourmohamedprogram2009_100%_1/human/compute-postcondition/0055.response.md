Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `current_balance` is `a[1] - target` if `current_balance` was 0 before, otherwise it is `current_balance + a[1] - target`, and if the `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated by adding the difference between the second element of list `a` (`a[1]`) and the `target` value. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `possible` is still dependent on the value of `current_balance`.
