Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 0, _ is 1, t is at least 3, stdin contains 0 test cases, and if the current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
