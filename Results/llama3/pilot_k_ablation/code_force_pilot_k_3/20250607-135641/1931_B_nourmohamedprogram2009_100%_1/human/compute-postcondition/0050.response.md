Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 0, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to `a[0] - target`, which means it now holds the difference between the first element of the list `a` and the target value. The other variables remain unchanged.
