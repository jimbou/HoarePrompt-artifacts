Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 2, `current_balance` is increased by `a[3] - target`, stdin contains 0 test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the value of `possible` remains unchanged.***
