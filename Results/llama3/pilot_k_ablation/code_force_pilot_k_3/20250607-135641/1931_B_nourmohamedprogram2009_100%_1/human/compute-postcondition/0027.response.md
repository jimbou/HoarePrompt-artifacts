Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[j]` - `target` for all `j` in range(`i+1`), `possible` is True, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 2, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `i` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_balance` has been updated to include the difference between the `i-th` element of `a` and the `target` value. The value of `i` has been incremented to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
