To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.

To adjust the states, we increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 3. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 3, _ is 2, t is at least 2, current_balance is increased by a[2] - target, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged.**
