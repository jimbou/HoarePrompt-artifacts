Output State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is increased by a[i] - target, if the updated current_balance is negative, then possible is False, i is at least 1**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated by adding the difference between the `i-th` element of list `a` and the `target` value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, as one test case has been processed. The value of `i` is still at least 1, and the other variables retain their initial values.
