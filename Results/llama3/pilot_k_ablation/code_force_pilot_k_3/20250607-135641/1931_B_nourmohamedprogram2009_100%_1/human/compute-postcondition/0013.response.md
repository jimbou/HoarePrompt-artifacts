Output State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `current_balance` is increased by `a[i]` - `target`, if the updated `current_balance` is negative, then `possible` is False, `i` is at least 3. If the `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_balance` has been updated by adding the difference between the current element in list `a` and the target value. If this updated balance is negative, then the variable `possible` is set to False. The values of other variables remain unchanged. The index `i` has moved to the next position in the list `a`.
