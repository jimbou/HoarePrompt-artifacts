Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 2, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, and `current_balance` is `a[2] + a[i] - 2 * target` if `current_balance` was 0 before, otherwise it is `current_balance + a[i] - target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `_`, `t`, and `stdin` remains the same. The value of `i` is still 2. The value of `current_balance` is updated by adding `a[i] - target` to its previous value. If `current_balance` was initially 0, it is now `a[2] + a[i] - 2 * target`. If `current_balance` is negative, then `possible` is False.
