Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 0, _ is 1, t is at least 3, stdin contains 0 test cases, the current value of current_balance is less than 0, and possible is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`, effectively changing its state from `True` to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the state of the variables.

All other variables (`n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, `_`, `t`, `stdin`, and `current_balance`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. Therefore, their states remain the same as described in the initial state.
