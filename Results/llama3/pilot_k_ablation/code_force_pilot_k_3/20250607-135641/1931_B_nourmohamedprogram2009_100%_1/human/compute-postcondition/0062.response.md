Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is n, _ is 1, t is at least 3, stdin contains 0 test cases, current_balance is the sum of the integers in a minus n times the target, and if current_balance is less than 0 at any point, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible is True.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the `current_balance` will be the sum of all integers in list `a` minus `n` times the `target`. If at any point during the loop's execution the `current_balance` becomes less than 0, the `possible` variable will be set to False. Otherwise, it will remain True. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
