To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` being less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, and if the `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
