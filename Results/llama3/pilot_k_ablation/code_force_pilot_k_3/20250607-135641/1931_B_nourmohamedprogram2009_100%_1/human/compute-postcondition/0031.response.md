State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 2, _ is 2, t is at least 2, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the sum of a[j] - target for all j in range(i+1) is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
