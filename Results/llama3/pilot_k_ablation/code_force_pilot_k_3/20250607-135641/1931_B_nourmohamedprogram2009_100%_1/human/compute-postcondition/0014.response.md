Output State: **t is an integer and is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is increased by a[i] - target, possible is False, i is at least 3, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this final state, the value of `possible` has been set to False, and the loop has been terminated with the `break` statement. The value of `current_balance` has been updated based on the previous value of `a[i]` and `target`. All other variables remain unchanged.
