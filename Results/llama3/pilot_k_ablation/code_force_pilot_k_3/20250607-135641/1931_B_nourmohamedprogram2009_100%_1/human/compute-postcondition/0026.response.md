The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `n` does not need to be adjusted. However, `i` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i]` - `target` for all `i` in range(`n`), `possible` is True, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 2, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, `i` is 0**
