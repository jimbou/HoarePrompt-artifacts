Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is the sum of a[i] - target for all i in range(n), possible is True, _ is 2, t is at least 2, stdin contains 0 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    current_balance += a[i] - target
    if current_balance < 0:
        possible = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 1, _ is 2, t is at least 2, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the sum of a[j] - target for all j in range(i+1) is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is 2, _ is 2, t is at least 2, current_balance is increased by a[2] - target, stdin contains 0 test cases. If the current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the value of possible remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 3, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 2, `current_balance` is increased by `a[3] - target`, stdin contains 0 test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the value of `possible` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
