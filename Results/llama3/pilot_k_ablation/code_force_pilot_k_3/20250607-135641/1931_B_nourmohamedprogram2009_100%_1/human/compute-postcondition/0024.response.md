To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` (representing the loop counter) and `t` (the number of iterations).

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1 (since `t` is at least 1), so for the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented by 1.

State: **`_` is 2, `t` is at least 2, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is increased by a[i] - target for all i in range(n)**
