Output State: **t is an integer and is at least 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is n, _ is 0, current_balance is the sum of the integers in a minus n times the target. If current_balance is not less than 0 at any point, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `_` is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable `i` is still equal to `n`, which is the last value it was assigned during the loop. The variable `current_balance` now holds the final value after all iterations, which is the sum of the integers in `a` minus `n` times the target. The output state also indicates that if `current_balance` is not less than 0 at any point during the loop, then 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.
