Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 2, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 2, `current_balance` is increased by `a[2] - target`, stdin contains 0 test cases, if the sum of `a[j] - target` for all `j` in range(3) is less than 0, then `possible` is False, otherwise `possible` is not changed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_balance` is increased by the difference between the third element of list `a` and the average value of the elements in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `possible` is updated to False if the sum of the differences between the elements of `a` (starting from the third element) and the average value of the elements in `a` is less than 0, otherwise it remains unchanged.
