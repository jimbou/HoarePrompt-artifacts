Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, `a` is a list of `n` integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, `total_water` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `target` is the sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n`, `i` is 1, `_` is 1, `t` is at least 3, `stdin` contains 0 test cases, and `current_balance` is `a[1] - target` if `current_balance` was 0 before, otherwise it is `current_balance + a[1] - target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
