Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is the sum of a[i] - target for all i in range(n), possible is True, _ is 2, t is at least 2, stdin contains 0 test cases.**

The code first reads an integer `n` from stdin, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. Then, it reads a list of `n` integers from stdin, which are between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, and assigns it to `a`. The sum of the integers in `a` is calculated and assigned to `total_water`. The sum of the integers in `a` divided by `n` is calculated and assigned to `target`. The variable `current_balance` is initialized to 0 and then increased by `a[i] - target` for all `i` in range(`n`). The variable `possible` is set to True. The values of `_` and `t` remain unchanged, and stdin is left empty after reading the input.
