To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and `n`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified, but we know that `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. Since `i` is not specified, we can assume that `i` is the current iteration number, which is at least 0. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` is at least 1.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer and is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, if the initial current_balance is negative, then possible is False, i is at least 1**
