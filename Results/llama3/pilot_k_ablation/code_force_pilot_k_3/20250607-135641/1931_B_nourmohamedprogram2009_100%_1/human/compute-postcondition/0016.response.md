Output State: **t is an integer and is at least 1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, current_balance is increased by a[i] - target for all i in range(n), if the updated current_balance is negative, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible is True.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and `stdin` contains 0 test cases, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` also remain unchanged. The `current_balance` has been updated by adding `a[i] - target` for all `i` in the range of `n`. If the updated `current_balance` is negative, then `possible` is set to `False`, indicating that it is not possible to achieve the target balance. Otherwise, `possible` is set to `True`.
