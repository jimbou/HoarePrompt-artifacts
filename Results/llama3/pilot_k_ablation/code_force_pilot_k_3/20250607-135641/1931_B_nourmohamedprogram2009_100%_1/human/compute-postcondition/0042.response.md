Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a list of n integers between 0 and 10^9 inclusive, total_water is the sum of the integers in a, target is the sum of the integers in a divided by n, i is n, _ is 2, t is at least 2, stdin contains 0 test cases. The sum of a[j] - target for all j in range(n) is not less than 0, and therefore possible is True, and 'YES' is printed**
