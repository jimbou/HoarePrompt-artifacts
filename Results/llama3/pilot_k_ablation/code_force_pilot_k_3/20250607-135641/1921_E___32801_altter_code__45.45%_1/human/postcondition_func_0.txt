Determines the winner of a game based on the input coordinates and prints the result. The function takes no parameters and returns no value. It reads six integers from standard input, representing the dimensions of a game board and the coordinates of two players. If the x-coordinates of the two players are equal, the function prints 'draw'. Otherwise, it checks if the difference between the x-coordinates is odd or even and if the y-coordinates are equal. Based on these conditions, it prints either 'Alice' or 'Bob' to indicate the winner. The function does not modify the input values or return any result, only printing the outcome of the game to the console.
