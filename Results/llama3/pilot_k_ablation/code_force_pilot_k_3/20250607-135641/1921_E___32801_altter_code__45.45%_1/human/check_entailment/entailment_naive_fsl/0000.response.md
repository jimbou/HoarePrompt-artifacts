Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice and Bob are in the same column but on different rows, and Alice is not on the last row. In this case, the program should check if Bob can move to the same column as Alice, but the program does not do this.

For example, if the input is:

5 5 2 3 4 3

The program will output "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can move to the same column as Bob and win.

The program only checks if Alice and Bob are in the same column and if Alice is on the last row, but it does not check if Bob can move to the same column as Alice. This is a missing logic in the program.
