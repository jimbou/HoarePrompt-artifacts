Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The program checks the following conditions:

1. If Bob's chip is in the first row (x2 <= x1), the game is a draw.
2. If the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is odd and their columns are the same (y1 == y2), Alice wins.
3. If the difference between Alice's and Bob's rows is even and their columns are the same (y1 == y2), Bob wins.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct outcome of the game.

Correctness: **True**
