Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine the outcome of a game played on a checkered board by two players, Alice and Bob. The game's rules and constraints are well-defined in the problem description. The program's logic is based on analyzing the positions of the players' chips and determining the optimal moves to win or draw the game.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases (`tt`) and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the board (`n` and `m`) and the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips (`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`).
3.  The program then checks if Bob's chip is in a position to win immediately (i.e., `x2 <= x1`). If so, it prints "draw" and returns.
4.  Next, it checks if the difference between Alice's and Bob's x-coordinates (`x2 - x1`) is odd. If it is, the program determines the optimal move for Alice to win or draw the game.
5.  If the difference is even, the program determines the optimal move for Bob to win or draw the game.
6.  In both cases, the program checks various conditions to determine the outcome of the game, including the positions of the chips, the number of moves required to reach the opponent's chip, and the boundaries of the board.
7.  Based on these conditions, the program prints "Alice," "Bob," or "draw" to indicate the outcome of the game.

After analyzing the program's logic, it appears to be correct and consistent with the problem description. The program correctly handles various scenarios and edge cases, and its output matches the expected results.

Correctness: **True**
