Output State: **The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the variables remains the same: n and m are positive integers, x1 and x2 are positive integers between 1 and n, y1 and y2 are positive integers between 1 and m, x2 is larger than x1, (x2 - x1) is an odd number, y1 is equal to y2, and 'Alice' has been printed. The list r still contains six integers, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.**
