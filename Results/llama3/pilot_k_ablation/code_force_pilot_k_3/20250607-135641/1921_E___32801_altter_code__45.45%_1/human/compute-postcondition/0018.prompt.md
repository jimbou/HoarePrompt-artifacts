You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains six integers h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers, 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h, 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w.
    r = list(map(int, input().split()))
    n, m, x1, y1, x2, y2 = r[0], r[1], r[2], r[3], r[4], r[5]
    if (x2 <= x1) :
        print('draw')
        #This is printed: draw
        return
        #The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The program simply ends without producing any output or returning any value.
    #State: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, x1 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y1 is a positive integer between 1 and m, x2 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y2 is a positive integer between 1 and m, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. x2 is larger than x1
    if ((x2 - x1) % 2 != 0) :
        if (y1 == y2) :
            print('Alice')
            #This is printed: Alice
            return
            #The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The state of the variables remains the same: n and m are positive integers, x1 and x2 are positive integers between 1 and n, y1 and y2 are positive integers between 1 and m, x2 is larger than x1, (x2 - x1) is an odd number, y1 is equal to y2, and 'Alice' has been printed. The list r still contains six integers, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
        #State: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, x1 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y1 is a positive integer between 1 and m, x2 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y2 is a positive integer between 1 and m, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. x2 is larger than x1. The current value of (x2 - x1) is an odd number. y1 is not equal to y2
    else :
        if (y1 == y2) :
            print('bob')
            #This is printed: bob
            return
            #The program returns nothing because there is no value or variable specified in the return statement. The program ends without providing any output.
        #State: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, x1 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y1 is a positive integer between 1 and m, x2 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y2 is a positive integer between 1 and m, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. x2 is larger than x1. The difference between x2 and x1 is even. y1 and y2 are not equal

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns nothing, as there is no explicit return statement. The program simply ends without producing any output or returning any value.

Case_2: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, x1 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y1 is a positive integer between 1 and m, x2 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y2 is a positive integer between 1 and m, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. x2 is larger than x1. The current value of (x2 - x1) is an odd number. y1 is not equal to y2

Case_3: *n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, x1 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y1 is a positive integer between 1 and m, x2 is a positive integer between 1 and n, y2 is a positive integer between 1 and m, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. x2 is larger than x1. The difference between x2 and x1 is even. y1 and y2 are not equal


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
