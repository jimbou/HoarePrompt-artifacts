Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input coordinates are not in the order of (a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h) where (a, b) and (c, d) are diagonally opposite and (e, f) and (g, h) are diagonally opposite. 

For example, if the input is:

3
1 2
1 5
4 2
4 5

The program will calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (1, 5) which is not the diagonal of the square, and then calculate the distance between (1, 2) and (4, 2) which is also not the diagonal of the square. 

The program should calculate the distance between the two pairs of points that are diagonally opposite to find the diagonal of the square, and then calculate the area of the square using the diagonal. 

The correct program should find the two pairs of points that have the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate, and then calculate the distance between the two points in each pair to find the side length of the square. 

Here is a correct version of the program:

```python
import math

def func():
    t = int(input())
    for steps in range(t):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        (c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        (e, f) = map(int, input().split())
        (g, h) = map(int, input().split())
        points = [(a, b), (c, d), (e, f), (g, h)]
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        side_length = abs(points[0][0] - points[1][0])
        print(side_length * side_length)

func()
```

This program first sorts the points by their x-coordinates, and then calculates the side length of the square by finding the difference between the x-coordinates of the first two points. The area of the square is then calculated by squaring the side length.
