The only variable in the loop head is variable `steps` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `steps` and `t`. If `steps` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `steps` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again `steps` is increased by 1 so `steps` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, steps is 1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer, stdin contains 4t - 8 lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000). If x > n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n is printed.**
