The code prints the value of `x`, which is a non-negative integer and is less than or equal to `n`. Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, based on the precondition, the print statement will output the current value of `x`.

Output: **x (where x is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n)**
