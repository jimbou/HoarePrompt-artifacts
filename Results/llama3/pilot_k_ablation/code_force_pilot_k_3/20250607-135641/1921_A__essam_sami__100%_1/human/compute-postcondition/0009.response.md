Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 100, steps is 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is a non-negative integer, x is a non-negative integer, stdin contains 4t - 4 lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000). If x > n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n is printed.***
