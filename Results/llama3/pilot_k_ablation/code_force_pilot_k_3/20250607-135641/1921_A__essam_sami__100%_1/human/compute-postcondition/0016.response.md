Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 100, steps is 1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2, x is a non-negative integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, stdin contains 4t - 12 lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000). If x > n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 is being printed.***
