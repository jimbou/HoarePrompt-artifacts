Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100, steps is 2, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2, x is a non-negative integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, stdin contains 4t - 20 lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).**

The code reads four pairs of integers from stdin and assigns them to the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h. The values of n and x are then calculated based on these variables. The initial values of t and steps remain unchanged. The number of lines in stdin is reduced by 4.
