The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains one integer `t` (1 <= t <= 100) followed by 4t lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 100.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned, and the standard input still contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000)**
