Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, steps is t - 1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2, x is a non-negative integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, stdin contains 0 lines. If x is greater than n, then the value of n which is the squared Euclidean distance between points (a, b) and (c, d) is printed. Otherwise, the value of x which is (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2 is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `steps` will be one less than the initial value of `t`. The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h` will still be integers, and `n` and `x` will be non-negative integers representing the squared Euclidean distances between points `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, and points `(a, b)` and `(e, f)`, respectively. The standard input `stdin` will be empty, having been fully consumed by the loop. The loop will have printed either the value of `n` or `x` for each iteration, depending on which was greater.
