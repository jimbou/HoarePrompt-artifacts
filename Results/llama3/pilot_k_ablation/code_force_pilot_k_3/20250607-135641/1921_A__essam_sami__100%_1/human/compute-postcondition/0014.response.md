Based on the precondition, the variable `x` is a non-negative integer equal to `(a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2`. This means that `x` is the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`.

Since `a`, `b`, `e`, and `f` are integers, the differences between them will also be integers. The squares of these differences will be non-negative integers, and the sum of these squares will also be a non-negative integer.

Therefore, when the `print(x)` statement is executed, it will print a non-negative integer value representing the sum of the squares of the differences between `a` and `e`, and `b` and `f`.

Output: **a non-negative integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2**
