Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 100, steps is 1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h are integers, n is a non-negative integer equal to (a - c)^2 + (b - d)^2, x is a non-negative integer equal to (a - e)^2 + (b - f)^2, stdin contains 4t - 12 lines, each containing two integers x and y (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000).**

The code reads four lines from stdin, each containing two integers, and assigns them to the variables a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h. It then calculates the value of n as the sum of the squares of the differences between a and c, and b and d. Similarly, it calculates the value of x as the sum of the squares of the differences between a and e, and b and f. The values of t, steps, and the remaining input lines in stdin remain unchanged.
