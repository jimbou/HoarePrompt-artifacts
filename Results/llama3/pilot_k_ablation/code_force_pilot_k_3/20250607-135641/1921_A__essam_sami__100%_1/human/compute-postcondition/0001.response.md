To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `steps` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 100, we don't need to adjust its value. However, we need to ensure that `steps` is initialized to 0, which is the starting value for the `range` function.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains 4t lines, each containing two integers `x` and `y` (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000), `steps` is 0**
