This function reads input from stdin, expecting a series of test cases. Each test case consists of four lines, each containing two integers. The function calculates the squared Euclidean distance between the points represented by the first and second lines, and the points represented by the first and third lines. It then prints the smaller of these two distances. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, after which it concludes, leaving stdin empty.
