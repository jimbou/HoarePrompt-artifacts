Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a string of 'W' and 'B' characters. It calculates and prints the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string, which is the sum of the number of 'B' characters and the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
