Output State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character**

The code reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, which contains `t-1` test cases. The first line assigns the value of `n` to the variable `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 10. The second line assigns the value of `s` to the variable `s`, which is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.

The third line assigns the index of the first 'B' in `s` to the variable `first_black`. The fourth line assigns the index of the last 'B' in `s` to the variable `last_black`. The fifth line calculates the number of 'B' characters in `s` plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters and assigns it to the variable `min_paint`.

After the code executes, the value of `t` remains greater than 1, and the values of `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint` are updated according to the input values. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
