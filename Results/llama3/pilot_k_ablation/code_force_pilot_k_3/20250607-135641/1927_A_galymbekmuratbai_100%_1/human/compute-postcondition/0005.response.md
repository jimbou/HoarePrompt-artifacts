The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1, and stdin must contain t-1 test cases.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters**
