Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, and the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string s, which is the sum of the number of 'B' characters and the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, is printed**

The code reads an integer `n` and a string `s` from stdin, and calculates the index of the first and last 'B' characters in `s`, as well as the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string `s`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the newly read integer, and the value of `s` is updated to the newly read string. The values of `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint` are calculated based on the new values of `n` and `s`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1, as one test case has been processed.
