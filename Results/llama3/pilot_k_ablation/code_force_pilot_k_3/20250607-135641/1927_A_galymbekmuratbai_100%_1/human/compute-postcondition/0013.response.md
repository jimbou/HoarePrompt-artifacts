Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, and the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string s, which is the sum of the number of 'B' characters and the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, is printed for each test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The standard input `stdin` is empty, as all test cases have been read and processed. The variables `n`, `s`, `first_black`, `last_black`, and `min_paint` retain their values from the last iteration of the loop, which correspond to the last test case. The minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string `s` has been printed for each test case.
