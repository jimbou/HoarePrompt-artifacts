To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, `first_black` is the index of the first 'B' in `s`, `last_black` is the index of the last 'B' in `s`, `min_paint` is the number of 'B' characters in `s` plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, and the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string `s`, which is the sum of the number of 'B' characters and the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, is printed**
