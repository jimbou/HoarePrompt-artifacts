The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by `t` test cases. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), and the stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.**
