Output: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, and min_paint is printed, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be painted black in the string s to have all 'B' characters together, which is equal to the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters**
