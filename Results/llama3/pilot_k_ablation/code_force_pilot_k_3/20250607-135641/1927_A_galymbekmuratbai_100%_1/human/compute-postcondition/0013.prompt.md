Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    first_black = s.find('B')
    last_black = s.rfind('B')
    min_paint = last_black - first_black + 1
    print(min_paint)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, and min_paint is printed, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be painted black in the string s to have all 'B' characters together, which is equal to the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, and the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string s, which is the sum of the number of 'B' characters and the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 10, s is a string of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, first_black is the index of the first 'B' in s, last_black is the index of the last 'B' in s, min_paint is the number of 'B' characters in s plus the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string s of length n consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character, and the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string s, which is the sum of the number of 'B' characters and the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, is printed, and the minimum number of paint operations required to paint the string s, which is the sum of the number of 'B' characters and the number of 'W' characters between the first and last 'B' characters, is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
