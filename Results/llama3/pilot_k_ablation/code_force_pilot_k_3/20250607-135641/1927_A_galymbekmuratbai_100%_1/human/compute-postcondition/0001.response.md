According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10) followed by a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters, with at least one 'B' character**
