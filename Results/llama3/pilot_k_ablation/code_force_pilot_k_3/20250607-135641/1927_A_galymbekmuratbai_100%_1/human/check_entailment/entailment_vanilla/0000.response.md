Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the minimum length of a continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for all n cells to become white.
2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads the length of the strip `n` and the string `s` representing the strip.
4. It uses the `find()` method to find the index of the first occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, which represents the first black cell.
5. It uses the `rfind()` method to find the index of the last occurrence of 'B' in the string `s`, which represents the last black cell.
6. It calculates the minimum length of the segment to be repainted white by subtracting the index of the first black cell from the index of the last black cell and adding 1.
7. It prints the minimum length of the segment for each test case.

The given program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white. It correctly identifies the first and last black cells and calculates the minimum length of the segment.

Correctness: **True**
