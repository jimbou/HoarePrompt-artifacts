Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) â€” the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 32) followed by t strings of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    t = int(input())
    l = 0
    h = 0
    for i in range(t):
        a = str(input())
        
        for j in a:
            if j in 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif l < h:
            print('B')
        
    #State: `t` is 0, `a` is an empty string, `i` is the initial value of `t`, `l` is the total number of 'A's in all input strings, `h` is the total number of characters in all input strings that are not 'A', stdin is empty. If `l` is greater than `h`, 'A' is printed for each iteration where `l` > `h`. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, 'B' is printed for each iteration where `l` < `h`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of strings from standard input, each consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and prints 'A' or 'B' for each string based on the majority of 'A's or 'B's. It processes a specified number of strings (t) and keeps track of the total count of 'A's and 'B's across all strings. After processing all strings, the function leaves the input stream empty and prints 'A' for strings with more 'A's and 'B' for strings with more 'B's.

Reasoning:  
Correctness: **True** or **False**
