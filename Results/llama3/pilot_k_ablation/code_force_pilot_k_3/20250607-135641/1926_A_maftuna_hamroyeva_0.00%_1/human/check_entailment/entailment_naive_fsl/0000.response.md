Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the variables `l` and `h` are not reset to 0 after each test case. As a result, the counts from previous test cases are carried over to the next test case, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if the input is:

```
2
AAAAA
BBBBB
```

The program will output:

```
A
A
```

Instead of the correct output:

```
A
B
```

This is because the count of 'A's from the first test case is not reset to 0 before the second test case, so the count of 'A's in the second test case is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the variables `l` and `h` should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case. Here is the corrected code:

```
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        l = 0
        h = 0
        a = str(input())
        for j in a:
            if j in 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif l < h:
            print('B')
```
