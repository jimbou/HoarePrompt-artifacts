Correctness: **False** 

The issue with the given program is that the variables `l` and `h` are not being reset to 0 after each test case. This means that the counts from previous test cases are being carried over to the next test case, resulting in incorrect output.

To fix this, the variables `l` and `h` should be reset to 0 at the beginning of each test case. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        l = 0
        h = 0
        a = str(input())
        for j in a:
            if j in 'A':
                l += 1
            else:
                h += 1
        if l > h:
            print('A')
        elif l < h:
            print('B')
```

Alternatively, you can use the `count()` method of strings to simplify the code:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for i in range(t):
        a = str(input())
        if a.count('A') > a.count('B'):
            print('A')
        else:
            print('B')
```
