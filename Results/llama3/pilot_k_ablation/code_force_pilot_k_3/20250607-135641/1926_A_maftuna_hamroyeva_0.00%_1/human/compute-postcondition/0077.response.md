Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty string, `i` is the length of the input string plus 2, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string, `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A', stdin is empty, and the number of 'A's in the input string is less than or equal to the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A'. If the number of 'A's in the input string is less than the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A', then 'B' is printed.***
