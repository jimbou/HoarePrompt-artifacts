Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a non-empty string from the input that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is 3, `j` is the fourth character in the string `a`. If the first character in the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one. If the first character in the string `a` is not 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus two. If the first character in the string `a` is not 'A' and `j` is not in 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus three.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. The value of `h` now depends on the first character of the string `a` and the value of `j`. If the first character is 'A', `h` is the number of non-'A' characters plus one. If the first character is not 'A', `h` is the number of non-'A' characters plus two, unless `j` is not 'A', in which case `h` is the number of non-'A' characters plus three.
