To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is greater than 0. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 32, it is guaranteed to be greater than 0. Therefore, we don't need to adjust the state of `t`.

The only adjustment needed is to set `i` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `l` is 0, `h` is 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
