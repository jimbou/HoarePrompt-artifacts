Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a non-empty string from the input that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 3, stdin is empty. If the first character in the string `a` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A'. If the first character in the string `a` is not 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one. If the first character in the string `a` is not 'A' and `j` is not in 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus two.***
