Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 32, `a` is a string from the input that must have at least 1 character, `i` is 1. If the first character `j` in the string is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A'. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one.***
