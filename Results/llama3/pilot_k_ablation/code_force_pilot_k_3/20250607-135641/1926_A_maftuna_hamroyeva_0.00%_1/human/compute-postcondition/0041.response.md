Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32, `a` is a string from the input that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, `j` is the third character in the string. If the second character `j` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string. `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus two if the first character is not 'A' and the second character is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus two if the first character is 'A' and the second character is 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `h` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for `l` and `h` are still dependent on the values of the first and second characters of the input string, but the value of `h` has been increased by 1 in all cases.
