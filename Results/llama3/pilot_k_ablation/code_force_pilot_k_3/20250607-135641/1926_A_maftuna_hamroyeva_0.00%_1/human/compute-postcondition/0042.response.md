Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 32, `a` is a string from the input that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, `j` is the third character in the string. If the second character `j` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus three if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one. `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one if the first character is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus two if the second character is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one.**
