Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `a` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 0, `j` is the third character of `a`. If the third character of `a` is 'A', then `l` is 3 and `h` is 0. If the third character of `a` is in 'A' but not 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 1. If the third character of `a` is not in 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 2. If the third character of `a` is not in 'A' and not 'A', then `l` is 0 and `h` is 3.**
