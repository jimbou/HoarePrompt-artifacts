Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `a` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 0. If the second character of `a`, `j`, is 'A', then `l` is 2 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `h` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been incremented by 1. If the second character of `a` is 'A', then `l` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
