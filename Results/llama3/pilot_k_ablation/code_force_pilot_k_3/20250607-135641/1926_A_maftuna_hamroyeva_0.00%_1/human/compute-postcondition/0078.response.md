Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty string, `i` is the length of the input string plus 2, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string, `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A', stdin is empty. If `l` is greater than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, 'B' is printed if `l` is less than `h`.***
