Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `a` is a string, `i` is 0, `l` is the number of 'A's in `a`, `h` is the number of characters in `a` that are not 'A'. If `l` is higher than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, 'B' is printed if `l` is less than `h`, otherwise no printing occurs.***
