Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a non-empty string from the input, `i` is 2, stdin is empty. If the first character in the string `j` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A'. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one.***
