Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 32, `a` is a string from the input, `i` is 1, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string, `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A'. If `l` is higher than `h`, 'A' is printed. If `l` is less than or equal to `h`, 'B' is printed if `l` is less than `h`, otherwise no printing occurs.
Code of the loop:
for j in a:
    if j in 'A':
        l += 1
    else:
        h += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 32, `a` is a string from the input that must have at least 1 character, `i` is 1. If the first character `j` in the string is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A'. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string and `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 32, `a` is a string from the input that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `j` is the second character in the string. If the second character `j` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string. `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one if the first character is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus two if the second character is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 32, `a` is a string from the input that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is 1, `j` is the third character in the string. If the second character `j` is 'A', then `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus three if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two. Otherwise, `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus two if the first character is 'A', otherwise `l` is the number of 'A's in the input string plus one. `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one if the first character is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus two if the second character is not 'A', otherwise `h` is the number of characters in the input string that are not 'A' plus one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
