The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string a.  If the string a has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 character, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string a must have at least 2 characters and the first character of a, j, is the second character in the string a.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 32, `a` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is 0. If the second character of `a`, `j`, is 'A', then `l` is 1 and `h` is 0. Otherwise, `l` is 0 and `h` is 1.**
