This function reads a series of strings from standard input, each consisting of letters 'A' and 'B', and prints 'A' or 'B' for each string based on the majority of 'A's or 'B's. It processes a specified number of strings (t) and keeps track of the total count of 'A's and 'B's across all strings. After processing all strings, the function leaves the input stream empty and prints 'A' for strings with more 'A's and 'B' for strings with more 'B's.
