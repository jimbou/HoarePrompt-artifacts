Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). Additionally, it is guaranteed that `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.***
