To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `j` and the loop range defined by `n // 2`, `0`, and `-1`.

Given that `j` is `n // 2` at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop iterates from `n // 2` down to `1` with a step of `-1`, we can deduce the following:

- For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decremented by `1` because the loop iterates downwards.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged since it's not modified within the loop or dependent on the loop variable `j` in a way that would change its value for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjustments needed for the state at the start of the next iteration are:

- `j` is decremented by `1`, so `j` becomes `n // 2 - 1`.
- `n` remains the same, an integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000).
- `k` is dependent on `n` and `j`, so it would be `n - (n // 2 - 1)`, but since we're only considering the loop head variables for adjustments, we don't explicitly adjust `k` here. However, its value would be recalculated based on the new `j` and `n` in the loop body.
- `count` is either `0` or `j`, but since we're focusing on the loop head variables, we note that its value could change based on the loop logic, but it's not directly adjusted by the loop head iteration mechanism.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j` (with `j` being `n // 2 - 1`), `count` is either 0 or `j` (with `j` being `n // 2 - 1`).**
