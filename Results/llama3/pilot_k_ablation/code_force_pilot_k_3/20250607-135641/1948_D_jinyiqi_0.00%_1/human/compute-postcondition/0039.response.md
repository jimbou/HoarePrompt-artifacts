The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `n // 2 - 2`. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is either `j` or 0, `s` remains unchanged.**
