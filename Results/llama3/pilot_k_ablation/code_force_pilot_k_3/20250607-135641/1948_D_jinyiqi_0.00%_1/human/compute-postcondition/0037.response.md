Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is the next value in the range `0` to `n - j - 1` + 1, `s` remains unchanged. If `s[k]` is equal to `?` or `s[k + j]` is equal to `?` or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is either increased by 2 or remains 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
