Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1, `count` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1, and it is guaranteed that `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `s[k]`, `s[k + j]`, and `count` are still valid, but now `count` can be 2 if the conditions are met.
