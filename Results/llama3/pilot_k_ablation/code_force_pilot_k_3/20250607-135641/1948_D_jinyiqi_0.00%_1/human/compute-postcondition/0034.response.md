The only variable in the loop head is variable `k`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is the next value in the range `0` to `n - j - 1`, so for the loop to execute again `k` must be the next value in the range `0` to `n - j - 1` + 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is the next value in the range `0` to `n - j - 1` + 1, `s` remains unchanged, `count` is either increased by 1 or remains 0**
