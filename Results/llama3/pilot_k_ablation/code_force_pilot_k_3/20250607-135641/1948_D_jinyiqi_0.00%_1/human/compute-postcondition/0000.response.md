To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n // 2` is greater than 0.

State: **`stdin` contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000), `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is `n // 2`**
