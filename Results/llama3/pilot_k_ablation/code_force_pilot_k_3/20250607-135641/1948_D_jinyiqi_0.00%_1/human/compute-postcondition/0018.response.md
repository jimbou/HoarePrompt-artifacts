Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, `count` is increased by 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000).**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been increased by 1, while the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains two inputs: an integer and a string, with the same constraints as before.
