Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 1, `s` remains unchanged. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1. Additionally, `s[k]` is either equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `n`, `j`, `k`, and `s` remain the same. The value of `count` depends on the conditions specified in the initial state. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` becomes 2. Otherwise, `count` becomes 1. The relationship between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` remains the same as in the initial state.
