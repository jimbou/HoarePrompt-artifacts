Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). Additionally, it is guaranteed that `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**

The code simply resets the value of `count` to 0, without affecting the values of the other variables or the contents of stdin. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `count` is now explicitly set to 0.
