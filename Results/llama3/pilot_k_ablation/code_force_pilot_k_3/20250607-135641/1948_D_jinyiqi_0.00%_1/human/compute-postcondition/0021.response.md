Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is either 0 or `j`, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). If `count` is equal to `j`, then the program has printed `count * 2` and terminated. Otherwise, `count` is 0.**

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `k` has reached `n - j`, which is the upper limit of the loop. The value of `count` is either 0 or `j`, depending on whether the loop terminated early due to the condition `count == j` being met. If `count` is equal to `j`, the program has printed `count * 2` and terminated. Otherwise, `count` is 0, indicating that the loop completed all its iterations without meeting the termination condition. The state of the other variables, including `n`, `j`, and the input string `s`, remains unchanged.
