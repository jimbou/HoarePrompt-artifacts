Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is the next value in the range `0` to `n - j - 1`, `s` remains unchanged. If `s[k]` equals `?` or `s[k + j]` equals `?` or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
