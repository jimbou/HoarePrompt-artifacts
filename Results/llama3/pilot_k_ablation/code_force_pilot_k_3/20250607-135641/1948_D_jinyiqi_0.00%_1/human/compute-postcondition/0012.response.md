Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, and it is guaranteed that `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.***
