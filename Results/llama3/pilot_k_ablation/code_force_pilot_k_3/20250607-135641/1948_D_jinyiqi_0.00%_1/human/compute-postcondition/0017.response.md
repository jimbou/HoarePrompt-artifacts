To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for k in range(0, n - j):`. The objects involved are `k`, `n`, and `j`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `k` is less than `n - j`. At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, and `j` is `n // 2`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute again, we need to increment `k` by 1, so `k` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than 2. The value of `j` also remains the same.

The other variables, `count` and `s`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 2, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000).**
