Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
