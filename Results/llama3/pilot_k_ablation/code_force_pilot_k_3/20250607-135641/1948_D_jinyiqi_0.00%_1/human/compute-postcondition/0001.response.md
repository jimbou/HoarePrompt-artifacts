Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000).**

In this output state, the value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), and `j` is still equal to half of `n`. A new variable `count` has been introduced and initialized to 0. The contents of stdin remain unchanged, containing two inputs: an integer and a string.
