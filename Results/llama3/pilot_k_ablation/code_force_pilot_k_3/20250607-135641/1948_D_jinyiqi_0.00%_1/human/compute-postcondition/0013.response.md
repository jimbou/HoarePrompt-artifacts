The only variables in the loop head are variables  k, j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `j` and `n`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `j` is `n // 2`, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 1 so `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n - j` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 1, `count` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0, and it is guaranteed that `s[k]` is not equal to '?', `s[k + j]` is not equal to '?', and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`. Additionally, `count` is not equal to `j`.**
