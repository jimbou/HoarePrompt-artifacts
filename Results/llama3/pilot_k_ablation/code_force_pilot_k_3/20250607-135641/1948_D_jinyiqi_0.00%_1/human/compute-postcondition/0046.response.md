Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0, `s` remains unchanged. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0. Additionally, `s[k]` is either equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.***
