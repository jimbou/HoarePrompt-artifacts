Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0, `count` is 1, and the current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. The other variables, `n`, `j`, `k`, and the relationship between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`, remain unchanged.
