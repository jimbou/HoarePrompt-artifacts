Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000).
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer (1 <= `n` <= 1000), `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is either 0 or `j`, stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000). If `count` is equal to `j`, then the program has printed `count * 2` and terminated. Otherwise, `count` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is either `j` or 0, `s` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `s` remains unchanged. If `count` is equal to `j`, then the loop has finished executing and the function has returned. Otherwise, `count` is less than `j` and the loop has finished executing without returning.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
