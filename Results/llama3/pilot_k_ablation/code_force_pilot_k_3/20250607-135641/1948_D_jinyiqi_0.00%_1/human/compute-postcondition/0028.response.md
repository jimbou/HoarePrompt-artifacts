Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 <= `n` <= 1000), `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0, and either `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0. The other variables `n`, `j`, `k`, and the conditions related to `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` remain unchanged.
