#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= integer <= 1000) and then a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks (1 <= length of string <= 5000).
    for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
        count = 0
        
        for k in range(0, n - j):
            if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
                count += 1
            else:
                count = 0
            if count == j:
                print(count * 2)
                return
        
    #State: `j` is 1, `k` is `n - 1`, `count` is either 1 or 0, `s` remains unchanged.
    return 0
    #The program returns 0

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two inputs from stdin: an integer and a string, and returns the length of the longest substring that is a palindrome or 0 if no such palindrome exists. The function does not modify the input string.
