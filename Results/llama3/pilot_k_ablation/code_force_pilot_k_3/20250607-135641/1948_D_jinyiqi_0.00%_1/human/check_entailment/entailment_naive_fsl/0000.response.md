Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string is a single character. In this case, the function `func_1()` is not called because the length of the string is not divided by 2, and the program does not print anything. However, according to the problem description, the output should be 0 in this case.

For example, if the input is "a", the program does not print anything, but the correct output should be 0.
