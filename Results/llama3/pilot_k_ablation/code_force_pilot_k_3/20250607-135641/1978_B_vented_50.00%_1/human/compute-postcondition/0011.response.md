Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `x` is a list of three integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit which is equal to `n` times `a` is being printed. If `a` is less than `b`, the profit which is equal to `n` times `a` plus (`b` - `a`) times (`k` + 1) minus `k` times (`k` + 1) divided by 2, where `k` is the minimum of `n` - 1 and `b` - `a`, is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The number of test cases in stdin has also been decreased by one.
