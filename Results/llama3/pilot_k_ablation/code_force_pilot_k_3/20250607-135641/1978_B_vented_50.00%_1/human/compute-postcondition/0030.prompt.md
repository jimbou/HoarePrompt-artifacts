Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    n = x[0]
    a = x[1]
    b = x[2]
    profit = n * a
    if a >= b:
        print(profit)
    else:
        k = b - a
        k = min(n - 1, k)
        profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
        print(int(profit))
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `x` is a list of three integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit which is equal to `n` times `a` is being printed. If `a` is less than `b`, the profit which is equal to `n` times `a` plus (`b` - `a`) times (`k` + 1) minus `k` times (`k` + 1) divided by 2, where `k` is the minimum of `n` - 1 and `b` - `a`, is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is a positive integer decreased by 1 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit, which is equal to the product of n and a, is printed. Otherwise, k is calculated as the minimum of n - 1 and b - a, and the profit, which is equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (k + 1) minus k * (k + 1) / 2, is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `x` is a list of three integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit which is equal to `n*a` is being printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`, profit is an integer equal to the product of `n` and `a` plus `(b - a) * (k + 1)` minus `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and the integer value of profit is being printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
