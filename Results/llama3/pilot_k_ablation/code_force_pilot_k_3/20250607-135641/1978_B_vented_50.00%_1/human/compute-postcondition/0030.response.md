Output State: **`t` is 0, stdin contains no test cases, `x` is a list of three integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit which is equal to `n` times `a` is being printed. If `a` is less than `b`, the profit which is equal to `n` times `a` plus (`b` - `a`) times (`k` + 1) minus `k` times (`k` + 1) divided by 2, where `k` is the minimum of `n` - 1 and `b` - `a`, is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` becomes 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The stdin contains no more test cases, and the variables `x`, `n`, `a`, and `b` retain their last values from the last iteration. The profit is calculated and printed based on the conditions specified in the loop body.
