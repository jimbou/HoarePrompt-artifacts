The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer decreased by 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time t needed to have been greater than 1 and t currently must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 1 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, `x` is a list of three integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9**
