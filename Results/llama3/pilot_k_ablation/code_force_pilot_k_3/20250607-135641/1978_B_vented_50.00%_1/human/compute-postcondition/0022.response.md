The code snippet reads a line of input from stdin, splits it into three integers, and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b`, respectively. It then calculates the profit by multiplying `n` and `a`.

Output State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1 and greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a**
