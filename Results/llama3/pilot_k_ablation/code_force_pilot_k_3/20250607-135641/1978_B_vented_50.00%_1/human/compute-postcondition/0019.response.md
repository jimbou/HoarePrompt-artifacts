Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer decreased by 1 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit, which is equal to the product of n and a, is printed. Otherwise, k is calculated as the minimum of n - 1 and b - a, and the profit, which is equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (k + 1) minus k * (k + 1) / 2, is printed.***
