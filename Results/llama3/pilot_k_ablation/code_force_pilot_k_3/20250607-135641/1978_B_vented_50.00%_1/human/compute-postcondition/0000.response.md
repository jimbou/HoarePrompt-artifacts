Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first test case from the input, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one test case, since one test case has been read and assigned to `t`. The rest of the test cases remain in the stdin, each containing three integers n, a, and b within the specified range.
