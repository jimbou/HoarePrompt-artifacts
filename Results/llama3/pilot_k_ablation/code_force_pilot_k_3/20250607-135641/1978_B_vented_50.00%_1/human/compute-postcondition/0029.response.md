Output State: **`t` is a positive integer decreased by 2 and greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, `x` is a list of three integers, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the profit which is equal to `n*a` is being printed. Otherwise, `k` is an integer equal to the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`, profit is an integer equal to the product of `n` and `a` plus `(b - a) * (k + 1)` minus `k * (k + 1) / 2`, and the integer value of profit is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decreased by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
