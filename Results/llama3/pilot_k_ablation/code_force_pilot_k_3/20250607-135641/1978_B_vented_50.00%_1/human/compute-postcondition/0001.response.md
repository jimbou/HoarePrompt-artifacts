According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. Each test case contains three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) â€” the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.**
