According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer decreased by 1 and greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1 and greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9**
