The code prints the value of `profit` as an integer, which is the product of `n` and `a` plus `(b - a)` times `(k + 1)` minus `k` times `(k + 1)` divided by 2.
Output: **t is a positive integer decreased by 1 and greater than 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four test cases, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 1 and b - a, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (k + 1) minus k * (k + 1) / 2, and the integer value of profit is being printed**
