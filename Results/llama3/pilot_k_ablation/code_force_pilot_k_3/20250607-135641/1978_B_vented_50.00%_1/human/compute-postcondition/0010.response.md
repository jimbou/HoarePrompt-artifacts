Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n times a is being printed. If a is less than b, the profit which is equal to n times a plus (b - a) times (k + 1) minus k times (k + 1) divided by 2, where k is the minimum of n - 1 and b - a, is being printed.***
