Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k. The second line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}). The third line contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, ..., d_m (1 <= d_i <= 10^9). The fourth line contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, ..., f_k (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).**
