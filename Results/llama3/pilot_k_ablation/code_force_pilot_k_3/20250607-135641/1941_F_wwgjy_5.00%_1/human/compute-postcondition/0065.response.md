Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` < `s` < `end`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `remain` should be inserted in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.**
