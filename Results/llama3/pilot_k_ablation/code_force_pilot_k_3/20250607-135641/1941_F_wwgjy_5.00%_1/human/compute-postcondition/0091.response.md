Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is infinity, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is m - 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, s is f[j] + b[i] if j is at least 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[i]. The current value of res is infinity, and the first element of the first tuple in gap which is start is being printed**
