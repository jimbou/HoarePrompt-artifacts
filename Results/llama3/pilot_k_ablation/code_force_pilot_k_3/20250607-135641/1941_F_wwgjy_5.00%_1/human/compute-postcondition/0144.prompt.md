Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of four lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k. The second line contains n distinct integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}). The third line contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, ..., d_m (1 <= d_i <= 10^9). The fourth line contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, ..., f_k (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            continue
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, m is 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end, remain is mid minus the ith element of b, j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order, _ is 0, i is m, s is either f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[i], and res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs. If res is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in gap which is start is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start < s < end, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is m - 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, s is f[j] + b[i] if j is at least 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[i]. If start < s < end, then res is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If res is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in gap which is start is printed. Otherwise, res is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are as described in the precondition. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is `start` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `res` which is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
