Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `stdin`, `i`, `remain`, `j` are as described in the precondition. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is `start` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `res` which is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged is being printed.***
