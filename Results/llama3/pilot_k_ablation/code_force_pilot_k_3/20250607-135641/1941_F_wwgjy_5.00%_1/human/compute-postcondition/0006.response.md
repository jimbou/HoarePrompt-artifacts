Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is infinity, remain is mid minus the ith element of b, j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order, _ is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, and j is not equal to k***
