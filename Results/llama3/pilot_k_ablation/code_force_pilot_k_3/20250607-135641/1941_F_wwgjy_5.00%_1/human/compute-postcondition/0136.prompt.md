Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is infinity, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, i is m - 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        continue
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `remain` should be inserted in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, i is 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is f[j - 1] + b[i], otherwise s is f[j] + b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `remain` should be inserted in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `s` is calculated as `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
