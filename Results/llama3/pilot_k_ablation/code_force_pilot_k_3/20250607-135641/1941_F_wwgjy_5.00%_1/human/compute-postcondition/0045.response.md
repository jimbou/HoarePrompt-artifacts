Output: **the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end (where start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap or 0 if gap has only one tuple, and s is either f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[i])**
