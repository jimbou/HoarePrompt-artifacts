Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `remain` is `mid` minus the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, and `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
