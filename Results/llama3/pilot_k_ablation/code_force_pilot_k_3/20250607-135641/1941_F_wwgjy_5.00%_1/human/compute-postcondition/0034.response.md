Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` - `s`, `s` - `start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `remain` is `mid` minus the ith element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is updated to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` - `s`, `s` - `start`, and `nd`.**
