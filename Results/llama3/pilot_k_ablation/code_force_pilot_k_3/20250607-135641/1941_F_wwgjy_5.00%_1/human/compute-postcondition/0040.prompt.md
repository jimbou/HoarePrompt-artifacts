Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is infinity, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        continue
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `remain` is `mid` minus the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs. If `j` equals `k`, the program skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is the sum of the `(j-1)`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `remain` is `mid` minus the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, and either we skip to the next iteration of the loop if `j` equals `k`, or `s` is updated to be `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, m is greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end, remain is mid minus the ith element of b, j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order, _ is 0, i is 2, s is either f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is f[j - 1] + b[i], and res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If j equals k, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
