Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is infinity, `remain` is `mid` minus the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `s` is the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `s` which is the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b`. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
