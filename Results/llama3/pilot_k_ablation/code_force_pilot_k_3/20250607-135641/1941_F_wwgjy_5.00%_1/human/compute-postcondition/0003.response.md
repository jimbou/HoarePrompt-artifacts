Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is infinity, remain is mid minus the ith element of b, j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order, _ is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, and `res` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `remain` is calculated as the difference between `mid` and the `i`-th element of `b`, and `j` is determined as the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged as 0. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus 4 inputs.
