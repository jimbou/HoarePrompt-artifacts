Output State: **n is an integer, m is at least 3, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the first tuple in gap, end is the second element of the first tuple in gap, mid is the average of start and end, nd is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in gap (or 0 if gap has only one tuple), res is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start < s < end, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, i is 2, remain is mid - b[i], j is the index where remain should be inserted in f to maintain sorted order, s is f[j] + b[i].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that s is now equal to f[j] + b[i]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
