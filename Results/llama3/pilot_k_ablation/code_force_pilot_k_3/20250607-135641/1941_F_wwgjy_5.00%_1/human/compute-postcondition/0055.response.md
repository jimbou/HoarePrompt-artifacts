Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the first tuple in `gap`, `end` is the second element of the first tuple in `gap`, `mid` is the average of `start` and `end`, `nd` is the difference between the second and first elements of the second tuple in `gap` (or 0 if `gap` has only one tuple), `res` is infinity, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the index where `remain` should be inserted in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `s` which is the sum of the element at index `j` in list `f` and the element at index `i` in list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
