This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four lines: three integers n, m, and k, followed by n distinct integers, m integers, and k integers. For each test case, it calculates the minimum distance between a pair of integers from the second and third lines that fall within a specific range defined by the first two integers of the first line. If no such pair is found, it prints the difference between the first two integers of the first line. The function prints the result for each test case and resets all variables for the next test case.
