Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is `n - 1`, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1` and also contains `b[n - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer, `q` remains 0, `n` remains an integer, `b` remains a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` remains a sorted list of integers, `req` remains an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` remains `n - 1`, `k` remains 0, `a` remains a list of integers, `ans1` remains a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` remains an empty list, and `l` is updated to contain all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1` and also includes the value of `b[n - 1]`.
