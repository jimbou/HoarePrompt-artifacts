Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is equal to `req` if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is equal to `req - 2`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` is a list containing all values of `b[i - 1]` that are not in `ans1` and the current value of `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is a list containing all values of `b[i - 1]` that are not in `ans1`, `ans1` has been printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` has been printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the program continues with the next iteration.
