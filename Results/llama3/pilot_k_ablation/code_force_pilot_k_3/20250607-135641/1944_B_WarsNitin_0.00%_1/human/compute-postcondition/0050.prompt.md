Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is equal to `req` which is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is either 0, -2 or the original value minus 2, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is at least 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list containing all the repeated elements in b, ans2 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is an empty list, and l is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in b that are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then b[n - 1] is added to l.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is either 0, -2 or the original value minus 2, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is either -2, -4 or the original value minus 4, and `ans2` is a list containing four occurrences of the current value of `c[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is either 0, -2 or the original value minus 2, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list containing four occurrences of the current value of `c[i]`, and `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
