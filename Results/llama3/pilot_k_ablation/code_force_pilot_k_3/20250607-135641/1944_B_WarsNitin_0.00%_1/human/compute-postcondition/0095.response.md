Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` contains two additional elements equal to `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list of integers that includes the value of `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
