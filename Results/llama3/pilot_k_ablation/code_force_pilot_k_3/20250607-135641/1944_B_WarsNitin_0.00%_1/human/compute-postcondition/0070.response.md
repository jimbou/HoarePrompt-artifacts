Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is -1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, l is an empty list.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `q` remains unchanged as 1. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The list `b` is updated to a sorted list of `n` integers, which are the first `n` elements of the list `a`. The list `c` is updated to a sorted list of integers, which are the remaining elements of the list `a` after the first `n` elements. The value of `req` is updated to an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`. The value of `k` is updated to an even integer equal to twice its original value. The input buffer `stdin` now contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input. The value of `i` remains unchanged as -1. The list `a` is updated to a list of integers read from the input. The lists `ans1` and `ans2` are initialized as empty lists. The list `l` is initialized as an empty list.
