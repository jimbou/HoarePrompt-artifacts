Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0, `ans2` includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variable `i` has reached the value of `n`. The variable `k` has been decremented to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The list `ans2` now includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]`, as well as all elements from the list `l`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` also includes two additional copies of `c[i]`.
