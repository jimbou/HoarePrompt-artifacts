Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an even integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]`, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is 1. The current value of `k` is not 0. `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1` and is now in `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b[i - 1]` is appended to the list `l`, which now contains this value. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code execution are still true.
