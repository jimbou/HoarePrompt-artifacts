Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is n - 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then b[n - 1] is added to l.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` remains an empty list, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `k` is 0, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l` if it is not in `ans1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is greater than 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise k remains unchanged, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is at least 2, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 remains an empty list, l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1. If k is 0, then b[n - 1] is added to l if it is not in ans1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4, ans2 is a list of integers that includes four copies of the current value of c[i]. If k is -2, then b[n - 1] is added to l if it is not in ans1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` remains an empty list, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `k` is 0, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l` if it is not in `ans1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes four copies of the current value of `c[i]`. If `k` is -2, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l` if it is not in `ans1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
