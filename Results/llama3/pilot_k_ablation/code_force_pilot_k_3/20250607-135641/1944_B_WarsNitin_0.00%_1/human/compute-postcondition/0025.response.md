Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer minus 4, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing four copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer minus 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `l` has been updated to include the value of `b[i - 1]` if it is not already in `ans1`, or to include two copies of `b[i - 1]` if it is already in `ans1`.
