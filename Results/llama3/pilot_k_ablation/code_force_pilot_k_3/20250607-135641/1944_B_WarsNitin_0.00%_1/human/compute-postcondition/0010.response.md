Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an even integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, l is an empty list, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is 1. The current value of k is not 0. b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1]. The current value of b[i - 1] is not in ans1.***
