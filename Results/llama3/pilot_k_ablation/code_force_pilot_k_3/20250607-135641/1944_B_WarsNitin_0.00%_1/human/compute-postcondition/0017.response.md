Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is 2, a is a list of integers, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing the value of b[i - 1] if b[i - 1] is not in ans1, otherwise l is an empty list, ans1 is a list containing four copies of the current value of b[i], k is an even integer minus 4 if b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], otherwise k is an even integer minus 2.**

The code appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, effectively adding two copies of `b[i]` to `ans1`. Then, it decrements `k` by 2. The value of `k` depends on whether `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`. If they are equal, `k` becomes an even integer minus 4; otherwise, it becomes an even integer minus 2. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
