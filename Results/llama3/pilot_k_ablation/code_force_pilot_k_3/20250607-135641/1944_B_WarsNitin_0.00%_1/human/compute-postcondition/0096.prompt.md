Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is -1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, l is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, a is a list of integers, i is 1. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then k is an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2, ans1 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, and l is an empty list. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, and if b[i - 1] is not in ans1, then l is a list containing the value of b[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4, `ans1` is a list of integers with two additional elements equal to `b[2]`, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list that contains the integer at index `i - 1` of `b` (which is the integer at index 1 of `b`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` contains two additional elements equal to `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list of integers that includes the value of `b[2]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
