Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes an additional element from `l`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes an additional element from `l`, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least two elements. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
