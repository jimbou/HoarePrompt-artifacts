To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `l`. If `l` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 (the starting index of the range). Additionally, `l` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is 0, `k` is 0, `ans2` includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` must have at least 1 element**
