Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is n - 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then b[n - 1] is added to l.**

In this output state, the value of k has been updated to be equal to req, which is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k. All other variables remain unchanged.
