Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` is an empty list, `ans1` is printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` is printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the program execution is interrupted by the break statement.
