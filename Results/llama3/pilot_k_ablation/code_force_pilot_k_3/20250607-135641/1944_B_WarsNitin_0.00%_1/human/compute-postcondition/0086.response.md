Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2, `l` is a list that contains the integer at index `i - 1` of `b` (which is the integer at index 1 of `b`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer, `q` is still 1, `n` is still at least 3, `b` and `c` are still sorted lists of integers, `req` is still an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `stdin` still contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is still a list of integers, `i` is still 2, and `l` now contains the integer at index 1 of `b`.
