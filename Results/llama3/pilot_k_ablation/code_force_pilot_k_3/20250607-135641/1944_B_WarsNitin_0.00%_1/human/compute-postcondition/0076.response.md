Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, l is an empty list.**

The code snippet appends the current value of `b[i]` to `ans1` twice, effectively adding two occurrences of the same value to `ans1`. Since `b` is a sorted list and the current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` now contains two identical values. The value of `k` is decremented by 2, making it an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
