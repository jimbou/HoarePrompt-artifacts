Output State: **`i` is 1, `k` is 0, `ans1` includes the first element of `l`, `ans2` includes the first element of `l` and two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `i`, `k`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` remain unchanged.
