Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an even integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, l is an empty list, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is 1. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
