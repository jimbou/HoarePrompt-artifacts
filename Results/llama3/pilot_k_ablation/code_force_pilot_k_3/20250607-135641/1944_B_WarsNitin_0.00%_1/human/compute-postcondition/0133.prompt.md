Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is n - 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes an additional element from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes an additional element from l, l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least one element and has one less element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is n, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes an additional element from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes an additional element from l, l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least two elements, ans1 has an additional element from l, ans2 has an additional element from l.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes two additional elements from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes two additional elements from l, l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least one element, and if k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
