Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is equal to `req` which is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`. The current value of `k` is 0.**
