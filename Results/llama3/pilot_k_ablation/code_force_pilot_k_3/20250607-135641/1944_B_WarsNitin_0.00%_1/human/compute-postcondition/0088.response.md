Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4, `ans1` is a list of integers with two additional elements equal to `b[2]`, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list that contains the integer at index `i - 1` of `b` (which is the integer at index 1 of `b`).***
