Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.***
