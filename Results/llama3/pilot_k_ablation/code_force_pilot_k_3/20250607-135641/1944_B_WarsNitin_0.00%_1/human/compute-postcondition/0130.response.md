Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes an additional element from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes an additional element from l, l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least three elements, ans1 has an additional element from l, ans2 has an additional element from l, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input.
