The code prints the elements of the list `ans1`. The list `ans1` contains all the repeated elements in the sorted list `b` and all the elements in the empty list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `ans1` only contains the repeated elements in `b`. 

Output: **all the repeated elements in the sorted list b**
