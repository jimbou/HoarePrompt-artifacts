Postcondition: ***The program has either broken out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0, or it continues with the next iteration if `k` is not 0, with all other variables retaining their current values. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains two additional elements, both of which are `c[i]`, and `k` is 2 less than its original value. Otherwise, the program continues with the next iteration if `k` is not 0, or it has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0, with all other variables retaining their current values.***
