Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is equal to req - 2, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l and two copies of c[i], l is a list containing all values of b[i - 1] that are not in ans1 and the current value of b[n - 1] if b[n - 1] is not in ans1, otherwise l is a list containing all values of b[i - 1] that are not in ans1.**

The code appends two copies of the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2` and decrements `k` by 2. Since `k` was equal to `req`, which is an even integer, `k` is now equal to `req - 2`. The value of `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, so two copies of `c[i]` are added to `ans2`. No other variables are affected.
