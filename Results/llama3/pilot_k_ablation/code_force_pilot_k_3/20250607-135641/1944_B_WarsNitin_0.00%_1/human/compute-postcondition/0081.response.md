Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, a is a list of integers, i is 1. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then k is an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2, ans1 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, and l is an empty list. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, and if b[i - 1] is not in ans1, then l is a list containing the value of b[i - 1].***
