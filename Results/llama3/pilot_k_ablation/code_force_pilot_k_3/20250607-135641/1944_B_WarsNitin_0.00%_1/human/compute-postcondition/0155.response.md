Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is either -2 or 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` is printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0. Additionally, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` includes two copies of the current value of `b[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the value of `b[i - 1]`. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0, and `ans1` and `ans2` are still printed as before.
