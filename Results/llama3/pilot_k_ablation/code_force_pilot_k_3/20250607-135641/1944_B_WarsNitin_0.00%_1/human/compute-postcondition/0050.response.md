Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is n - 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list containing all the repeated elements in b, ans2 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is not equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing four occurrences of the current value of c[i], and l is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in b that are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then b[n - 1] is added to l.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- `t` remains a positive integer.
- `q` remains 0.
- `n` remains an integer.
- `b` remains a sorted list of `n` integers.
- `c` remains a sorted list of integers.
- `req` remains an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`.
- `k` becomes 0 after the loop finishes executing.
- `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input.
- `i` becomes `n - 1` after the loop finishes executing.
- `a` remains a list of integers.
- `ans1` remains a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`.
- `ans2` is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list containing four occurrences of the current value of `c[i]`.
- `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`.
