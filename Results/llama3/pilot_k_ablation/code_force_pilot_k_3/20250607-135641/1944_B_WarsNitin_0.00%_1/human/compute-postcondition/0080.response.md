Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list. If b[i - 1] is not in ans1, then l is a list containing the value of b[i - 1].***
