Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The stdin still contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input.
