Output State: **`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `ans2` includes the first, second, and third elements of `l` and two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` must have at least 3 elements.**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2, and the value of `k` remains unchanged at 0. The list `ans1` now includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, as the code appends the third element of `l` to `ans1`. The list `ans2` also includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, as well as two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`. The list `l` still must have at least 3 elements.
