Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 2, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 0, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l is an empty list, ans1 is printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, and ans2 is printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is either -2 or 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l is either an empty list or a list containing the value of b[i - 1] if b[i - 1] is not in ans1, ans1 is printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, and ans2 is printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if k is 0. Additionally, if b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 includes two copies of the current value of b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 3, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is either -4, -2 or 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 2, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l is either an empty list or a list containing the value of b[i - 1] if b[i - 1] is not in ans1, ans1 has been printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, and ans2 has been printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement if k is 0. Additionally, if b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 includes two copies of the current value of b[i]. If b[i - 1] is not in ans1, then l is a list containing the value of b[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is either -6, -4, -2 or 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `ans1` has been printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` has been printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0. Additionally, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` includes two copies of the current value of `b[i]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]`, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` has been appended with the value of `b[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
