Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is greater than 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is at least 2, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is a list of integers that includes four copies of the current value of c[i], l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1. If k is -2, then b[n - 1] is added to l if it is not in ans1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
