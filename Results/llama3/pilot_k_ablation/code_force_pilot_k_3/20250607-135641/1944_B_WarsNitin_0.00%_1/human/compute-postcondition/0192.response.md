Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `k` is 0, `ans2` includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` must have at least 1 element. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
