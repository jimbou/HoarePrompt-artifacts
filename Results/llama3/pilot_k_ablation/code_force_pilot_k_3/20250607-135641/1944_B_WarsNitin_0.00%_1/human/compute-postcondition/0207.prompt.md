Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the rest of the test cases.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[i - 1])
    if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is -1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list containing all the repeated elements in b and all the elements in l, ans2 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is not equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing four occurrences of the current value of c[i] and all the elements in l, l is an empty list, and the list of all the repeated elements in b and all the elements in l is being printed, and this is printed: two occurrences of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is not equal to c[i - 1], otherwise four occurrences of the current value of c[i] and all the elements in l

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 0, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l is an empty list, ans1 is printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, and ans2 is printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: i is equal to len(l), k is 0, ans1 includes all elements of l, ans2 includes all elements of l and two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l and two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l must have at least len(l) elements, all elements of ans1 are being printed, and all elements of ans2 are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
