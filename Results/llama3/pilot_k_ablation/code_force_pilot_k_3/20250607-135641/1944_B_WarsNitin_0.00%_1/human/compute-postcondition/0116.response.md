Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is at least 3, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` remains an empty list, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `k` is 0, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l` if it is not in `ans1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes four copies of the current value of `c[i]`. If `k` is -2, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l` if it is not in `ans1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
