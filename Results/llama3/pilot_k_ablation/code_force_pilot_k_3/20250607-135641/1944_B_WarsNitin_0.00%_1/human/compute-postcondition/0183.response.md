The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is in the range from 1 to `n-1`, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`i` is in the range from 2 to `n`, `n` is greater than `i`**
