Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, q is 2, n is an integer that must be at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is -2, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l and includes two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l is an empty list, ans1 is printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b and includes all elements from l, and ans2 is printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if k is 0. The current value of b[i] is equal to b[i - 1].**
