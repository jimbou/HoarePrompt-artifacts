Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is equal to `req` which is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `k` is updated to be equal to `req`, which is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `b` is still a sorted list of `n` integers, and `c` is still a sorted list of integers. The input stream `stdin` still contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input. The index `i` is still `n - 1`, and the lists `a`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`, and if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, it is still added to `l`.
