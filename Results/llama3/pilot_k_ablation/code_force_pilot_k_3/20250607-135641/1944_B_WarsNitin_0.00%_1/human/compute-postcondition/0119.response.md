Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The loop counter `i` reaches its final value of `n - 1`, and the variable `k` becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The list `ans2` contains two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]`, and the list `l` contains all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`.
