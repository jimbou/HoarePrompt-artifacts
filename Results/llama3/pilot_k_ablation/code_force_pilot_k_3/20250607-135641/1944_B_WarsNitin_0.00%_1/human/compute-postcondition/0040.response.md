The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is at least 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is either 0, -2 or the original value minus 2, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing all the repeated elements in `b`, `ans2` is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`.**
