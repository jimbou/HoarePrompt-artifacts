Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is 3. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer minus 4, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing four copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is an empty list. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer minus 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the conditions for `k`, `a`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` still depend on whether `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`.
