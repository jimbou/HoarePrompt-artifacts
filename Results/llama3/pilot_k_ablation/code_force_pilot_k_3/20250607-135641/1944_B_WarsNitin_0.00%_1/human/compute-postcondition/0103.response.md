Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then the current value of `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input.
