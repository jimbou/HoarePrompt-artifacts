Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is n - 1, k is 0, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list containing all the repeated elements in b, ans2 is an empty list, and l is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in b that are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then b[n - 1] is added to l.***
