Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` includes the first and second elements of `l`, `ans2` includes the first and second elements of `l` and two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` must have at least 3 elements and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0, otherwise nothing changes.***
