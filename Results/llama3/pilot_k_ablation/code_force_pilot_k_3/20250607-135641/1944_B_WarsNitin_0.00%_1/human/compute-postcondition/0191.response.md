Output State: **`i` is 0, `k` is 0, `ans2` includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` must have at least 1 element and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `k`, `ans2`, and `l` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition for `ans2` is still valid, and `l` still must have at least 1 element.
