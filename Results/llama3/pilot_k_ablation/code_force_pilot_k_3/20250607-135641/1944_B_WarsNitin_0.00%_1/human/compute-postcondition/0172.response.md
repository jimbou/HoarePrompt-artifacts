Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is equal to `req` and the current value of `k` is 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` is a list containing all values of `b[i - 1]` that are not in `ans1` and the current value of `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is a list containing all values of `b[i - 1]` that are not in `ans1`, `ans1` has been printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` has been printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code has no impact on the variables, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same as in the initial state.
