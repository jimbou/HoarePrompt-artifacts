Output State: **`i` is in the range from 2 to `n`, `n` is greater than `i`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, as the `break` statement only exits the current loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The relationship between `i` and `n` also remains the same, with `i` still being in the range from 2 to `n`, and `n` being greater than `i`.
