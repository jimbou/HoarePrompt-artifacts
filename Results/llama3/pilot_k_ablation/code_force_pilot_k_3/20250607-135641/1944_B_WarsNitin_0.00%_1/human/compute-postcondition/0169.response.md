Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `q` is 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is equal to `req`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is `n - 1`, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` is a list containing all values of `b[i - 1]` that are not in `ans1` and the current value of `b[n - 1]` if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is a list containing all values of `b[i - 1]` that are not in `ans1`, `ans1` has been printed, which is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b` and includes all elements from `l`, and `ans2` has been printed, which is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement if `k` is 0. Additionally, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` includes two copies of the current value of `b[i]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]`, and if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `l` has been appended with the value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `req`, which is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
