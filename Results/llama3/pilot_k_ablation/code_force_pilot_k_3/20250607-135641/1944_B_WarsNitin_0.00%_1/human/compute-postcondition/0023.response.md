Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer minus 4, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing four copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is an empty list. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is an even integer minus 2, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `b[i - 1]`.***
