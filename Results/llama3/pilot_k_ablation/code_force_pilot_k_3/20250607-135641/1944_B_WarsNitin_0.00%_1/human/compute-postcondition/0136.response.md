The code prints the elements of the list `ans2`, which includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from the empty list `l`. Since `l` is empty, `ans2` only contains two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]`.

Output: **two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1]**
