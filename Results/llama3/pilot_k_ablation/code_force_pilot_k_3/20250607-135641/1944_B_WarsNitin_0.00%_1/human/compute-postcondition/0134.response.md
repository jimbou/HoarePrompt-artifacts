The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans1`.

Based on the initial state, `ans1` is a list of integers that includes pairs of equal elements from `b` and all elements from `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `ans1` will only contain pairs of equal elements from `b`.

However, the initial state also mentions that `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least one element that is not a pair. This means that `b` contains at least one element that does not have a pair.

Therefore, the output will be the pairs of equal elements from `b`, but since `b` has at least one element that is not a pair, the output will not include all elements of `b`.

Output: **pairs of equal elements from b (excluding the element that is not a pair)**
