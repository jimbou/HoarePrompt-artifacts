Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `a` is a list of integers, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `stdin`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
