Output: **t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is 0, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is -1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list containing all the repeated elements in b and all the elements in l, ans2 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is not equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing four occurrences of the current value of c[i] and all the elements in l, l is an empty list, and the list of all the repeated elements in b and all the elements in l is being printed, and this is printed: two occurrences of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is not equal to c[i - 1], otherwise four occurrences of the current value of c[i] and all the elements in l**
