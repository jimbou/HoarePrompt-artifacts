Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 1, n is greater than 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, i is at least 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of the current value of c[i], l is a list of integers that includes all elements from b that are not in ans1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decremented by 2, and two copies of the current value of `c[i]` have been appended to `ans2`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the rest of the variables retain their original values.
