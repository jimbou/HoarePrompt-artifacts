Output State: **t is a positive integer, q is 0, n is an integer that must be at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, k is either -2 or the original value minus 2, stdin contains the rest of the test cases minus two lines of input, i is at least 1, a is a list of integers, ans1 is a list containing all the repeated elements in b, ans2 is a list containing two occurrences of the current value of c[i], and l is a list containing all the non-repeated elements in b that are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then b[n - 1] is added to l.**

The code snippet adds two occurrences of the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2` and decrements `k` by 2. The value of `c[i]` is equal to the value of `c[i - 1]`, so `ans2` now contains two occurrences of the same value. The value of `k` is either -2 or the original value minus 2, depending on its initial value. All other variables remain unchanged.
