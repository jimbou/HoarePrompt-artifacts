Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer, `q` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `k` is 0, `stdin` contains the rest of the test cases minus four lines of input, `i` is at least 1, `a` is a list of integers, `ans1` is a list of integers with pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list of integers that includes all elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then the current value of `b[n - 1]` is added to `l`.**
