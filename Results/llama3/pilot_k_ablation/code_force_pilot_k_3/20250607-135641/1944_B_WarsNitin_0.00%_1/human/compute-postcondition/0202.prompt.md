Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0, `ans2` includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: i is 0, k is 0, ans1 includes the first element of l, ans2 includes the first element of l and two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l and two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l must have at least 1 element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: i is 1, k is 0, ans1 includes the first and second elements of l, ans2 includes the first and second elements of l and two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l and two copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of c[i] that is equal to c[i - 1] and includes all elements from l, l must have at least 2 elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is 2, `k` is 0, `ans1` includes the first, second, and third elements of `l`, `ans2` includes the first, second, and third elements of `l` and two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l` and two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list of integers that includes two copies of each value of `c[i]` that is equal to `c[i - 1]` and includes all elements from `l`, `l` must have at least 3 elements.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
