This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, sorting them and selecting specific elements based on the value of k. It prints two lists of integers for each test case, where the first list contains all repeated elements from the first half of the input integers and some additional elements, and the second list contains two occurrences of each element from the second half of the input integers, with some elements repeated four times. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed, at which point the standard input is empty.
