Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 1 if the second character in `userString` is 'A', otherwise `countA` is 0, `countB` is 2 if the second character in `userString` is 'B', otherwise `countB` is 1, A list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the second character in `userString`.**

In this output state, the value of `countB` has been incremented by 1. If the second character in `userString` is 'B', then `countB` is now 2; otherwise, it is 1. The values of `userString`, `countA`, and `letter` remain unchanged.
