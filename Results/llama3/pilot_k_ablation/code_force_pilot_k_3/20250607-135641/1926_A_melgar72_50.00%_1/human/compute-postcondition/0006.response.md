Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 0, `countB` is 1, a list representation of `userString` exists in memory, the first character in `userString` is 'B' and the current value of `letter` is 'B'.**

The code increments the value of `countB` by 1. Since the initial value of `countB` is 0, the new value of `countB` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list representation of `userString` still exists in memory, and the first character in `userString` is still 'B'. The current value of `letter` is still 'B'.
