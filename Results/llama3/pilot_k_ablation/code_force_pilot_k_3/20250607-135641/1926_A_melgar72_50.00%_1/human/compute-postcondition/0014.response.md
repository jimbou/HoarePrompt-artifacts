Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 1 if the second character in `userString` is 'A', otherwise `countA` is 0, `countB` is 1 if the second character in `userString` is 'B', otherwise `countB` is 0, A list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the second character in `userString`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `userString`, `countA`, `countB`, and `letter` remain unchanged.
