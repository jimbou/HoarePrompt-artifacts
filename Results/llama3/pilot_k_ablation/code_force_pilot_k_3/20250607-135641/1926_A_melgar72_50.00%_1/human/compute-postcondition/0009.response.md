Postcondition: ***`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 0, a list representation of `userString` exists in memory, `letter` is the first character in `userString`. If the first character in `userString` is 'B', then `countB` is 1. If the first character in `userString` is not 'B', then `countB` is 0 and we skip the rest of the code inside the current loop or if statement.***
