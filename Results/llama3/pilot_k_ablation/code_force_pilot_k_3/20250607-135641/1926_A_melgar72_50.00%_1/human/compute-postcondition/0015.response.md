Postcondition: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 1 if the second character in `userString` is 'A', otherwise `countA` is 0, `countB` is 2 if the second character in `userString` is 'B', otherwise `countB` is 1, A list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the second character in `userString`. If the second character in `userString` is 'B', `countB` is incremented by 1. If the second character in `userString` is 'A', we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
