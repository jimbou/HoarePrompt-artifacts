To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `letter` and the string `userString`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `userString`. If `userString` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Since `userString` is a string of length 5, it already meets this condition. However, we need to adjust the state of `letter` to reflect that it will take on the value of the first character in `userString` when the loop starts.

State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 0, `countB` is 0, a list representation of `userString` exists in memory, `letter` is the first character in `userString`**
