Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 2 if the second character in `userString` is 'A', otherwise `countA` is 1, `countB` is 3 if the second character in `userString` is 'B', otherwise `countB` is 2, A list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the third character in `userString`.**

In this output state, the value of `countB` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3 if the second character in `userString` is 'B', otherwise it is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
