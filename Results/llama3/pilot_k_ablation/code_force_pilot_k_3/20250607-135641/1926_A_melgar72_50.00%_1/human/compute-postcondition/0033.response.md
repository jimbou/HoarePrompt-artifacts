Postcondition: ***`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is equal to the number of 'A's in `userString`, `countB` is equal to the number of 'B's in `userString`, a list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the last character in `userString`. Additionally, if `countB` is greater than `countA`, 'B' is being printed. Otherwise, `countA` is greater than or equal to `countB`.***
