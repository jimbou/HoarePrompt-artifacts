Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, countA is 0, countB is 0, and a list representation of userString exists in memory.
Code of the loop:
for letter in userString:
    if letter == 'A':
        countA += 1
    elif letter == 'B':
        countB += 1
    else:
        continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 1 if the first character in `userString` is 'A', otherwise `countA` is 0. `countB` is 1 if the first character in `userString` is 'B', otherwise `countB` is 0. A list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the first character in `userString`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 2 if the second character in `userString` is 'A', otherwise `countA` is 1, `countB` is 2 if the second character in `userString` is 'B', otherwise `countB` is 1, A list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the second character in `userString`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `countA` is 3 if the second and third characters in `userString` are 'A', otherwise `countA` is 2 if the second character in `userString` is 'A', otherwise `countA` is 1, `countB` is 3 if the second and third characters in `userString` are 'B', otherwise `countB` is 2 if the second character in `userString` is 'B' and the third character is 'A', otherwise `countB` is 1, A list representation of `userString` exists in memory, and the current value of `letter` is the third character in `userString`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
