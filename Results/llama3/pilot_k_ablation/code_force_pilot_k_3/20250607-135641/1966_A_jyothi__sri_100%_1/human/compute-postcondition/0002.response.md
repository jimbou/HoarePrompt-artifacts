The first line assigns the values of two integers from stdin to `n` and `k`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, and stdin contains `t` test cases, after this line, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `arrC`. Since each test case consists of two lines, after this line, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `hashmap`. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to `ans`.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
