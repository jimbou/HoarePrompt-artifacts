Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the second integer in the list. If i is a key in hashmap, the value of the key i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, i is added to hashmap as a key with a value of 1.**

The value of `ans` has been updated to `k - 1`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the second integer in the list, and the state of the hashmap remains the same, with `i` being a key with a value of 1 if it was not already present, or its value incremented by 1 if it was already present. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases.
