Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the third integer in the list is a key with a value of 1, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the third integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of hashmap[i] has been updated to 1, where i is the third integer in the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The hashmap now contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the third integer in the list and the value is 1. The value of ans is still dependent on the value of hashmap[i] and k. The stdin still contains t - 1 test cases.
