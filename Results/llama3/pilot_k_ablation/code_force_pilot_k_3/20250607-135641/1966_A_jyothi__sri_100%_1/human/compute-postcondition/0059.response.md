The value of hashmap[i] is incremented by 1. The value of hashmap[i] was previously equal to some integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, hashmap is a dictionary that contains the first integer i and hashmap[i] is incremented by 1, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. The current value of i is a key in hashmap.
