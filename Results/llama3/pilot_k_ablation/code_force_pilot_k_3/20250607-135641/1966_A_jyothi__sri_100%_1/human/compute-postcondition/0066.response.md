The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arrC`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arrC`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arrC` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added to `hashmap` with a value of 1. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.**
