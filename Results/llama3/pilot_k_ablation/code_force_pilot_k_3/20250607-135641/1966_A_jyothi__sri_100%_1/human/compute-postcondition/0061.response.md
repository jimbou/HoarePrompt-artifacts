Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `ans` is `n`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases, and `i` is in `hashmap`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is still an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is still a list of `n` integers with at least one integer, `i` is still the first integer in the list, `hashmap` now contains `i` as a key with a value of 1, `ans` is still `n`, there are `t - 1` test cases left in stdin, and `i` is now in `hashmap`.
