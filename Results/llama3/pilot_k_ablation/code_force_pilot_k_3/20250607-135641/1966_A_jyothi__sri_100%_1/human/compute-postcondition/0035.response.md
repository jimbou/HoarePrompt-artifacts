Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the first integer in the list. If i is already a key in hashmap, the value of the key i is increased by 1. Otherwise, hashmap contains one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1.***
