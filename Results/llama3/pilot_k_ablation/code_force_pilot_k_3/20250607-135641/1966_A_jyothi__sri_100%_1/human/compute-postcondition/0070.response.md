Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`, `ans` is `k - 1`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `i`, and `hashmap` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `ans` is now assigned the value of `k - 1`, regardless of the previous value of `hashmap[i]`.
