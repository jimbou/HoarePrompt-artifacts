Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer `i` in the list `arrC`, `i` is the third integer in the list `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `hashmap[i]` is set to 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, and `i` remain unchanged. A new variable `ans` is introduced, which is equal to `k-1`. The value of `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive, since `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
