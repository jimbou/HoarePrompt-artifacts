Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then hashmap[i] is at least k, ans is k - 1, and i is a key in hashmap with a value of at least k. Otherwise, hashmap[i] is incremented by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is the second integer in the list arrC.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of hashmap[i] is incremented by 1, where i is the second integer in the list arrC. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then hashmap[i] is at least k, ans is k - 1, and i is a key in hashmap with a value of at least k. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. The values of t, n, k, arrC, and stdin remain the same.
