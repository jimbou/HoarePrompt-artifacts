Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC and hashmap[i] is 1, ans is k - 1, and i is the second integer in the list arrC, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of t remains unchanged between 1 and 500 inclusive. The value of n remains unchanged between 1 and 100 inclusive. The value of k remains unchanged between 2 and 100 inclusive. The list arrC remains unchanged with n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive and must have at least 2 integers. The hashmap remains unchanged with at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC, but the value of hashmap[i] is now 1. The value of ans remains unchanged as k - 1. The value of i remains unchanged as the second integer in the list arrC. The stdin contains t-1 test cases.
