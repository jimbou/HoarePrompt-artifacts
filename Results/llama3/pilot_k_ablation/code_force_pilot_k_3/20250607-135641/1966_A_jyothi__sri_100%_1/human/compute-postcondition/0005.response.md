The value of hashmap[i] is incremented by 1. The value of hashmap[i] was at least 1, so the new value of hashmap[i] is at least 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. stdin still contains t-1 test cases.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC and hashmap[i] is at least 2, ans is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the current value of i is a key in hashmap.**
