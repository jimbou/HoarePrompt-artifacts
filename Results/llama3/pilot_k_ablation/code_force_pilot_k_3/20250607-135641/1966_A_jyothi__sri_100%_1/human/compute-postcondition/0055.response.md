The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t test cases, and i is the last integer in the list, and the value of ans is being printed which is either k - 1 or n depending on whether hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC**
