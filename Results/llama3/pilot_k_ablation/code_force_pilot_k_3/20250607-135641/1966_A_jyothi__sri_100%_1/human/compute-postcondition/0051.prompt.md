Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the first integer in the list. If i is already a key in hashmap, the value of the key i is increased by 1. Otherwise, hashmap contains one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ans is k - 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to ans.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the second integer in the list. If i is a key in hashmap, the value of the key i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, i is added to hashmap as a key with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, `ans` is `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n`, `i` is the third integer in the list, and stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
