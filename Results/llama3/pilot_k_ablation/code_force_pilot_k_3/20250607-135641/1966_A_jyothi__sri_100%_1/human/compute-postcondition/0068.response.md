Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` with a value of 1, `ans` is not changed**.

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` is reset to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is not affected because the condition `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k` is not met, as `hashmap[i]` is now 1, which is less than `k`.
