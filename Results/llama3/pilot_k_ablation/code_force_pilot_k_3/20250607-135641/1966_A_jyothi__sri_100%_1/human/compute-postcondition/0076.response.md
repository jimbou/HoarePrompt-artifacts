Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list. `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, its value is incremented by 1. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, it is added with a value of 1. If `hashmap[i]` is less than `k`, `ans` is either `k - 1` or unchanged, and `ans` is `k - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is now `k - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is still an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is still a list of `n` integers with at least 3 integers, and `i` is still the third integer in the list. The `hashmap` still contains the first integer `i` with its corresponding value.
