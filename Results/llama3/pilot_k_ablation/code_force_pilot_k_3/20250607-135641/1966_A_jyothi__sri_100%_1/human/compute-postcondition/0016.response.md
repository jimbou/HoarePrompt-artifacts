Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer `i` in the list `arrC`. If `i` is in `hashmap`, then if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `hashmap[i]` is at least `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`, and `i` is a key in `hashmap` with a value of at least `k`. Otherwise, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, `hashmap[i]` is 1, `ans` is `k - 1`, and `i` is the second integer in the list `arrC`. In both cases, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and `ans` is now `k - 1`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `hashmap` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is now set to `k - 1`, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1. The conditions related to `hashmap` and `ans` are still valid, but the value of `ans` is updated to `k - 1`.
