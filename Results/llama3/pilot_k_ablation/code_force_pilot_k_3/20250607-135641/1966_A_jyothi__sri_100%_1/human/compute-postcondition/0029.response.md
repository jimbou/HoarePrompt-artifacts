Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

In this final state, the values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The list `arrC` is now populated with `n` integers from the input. The dictionary `hashmap` is still empty, as it was not updated by the code. The variable `ans` is set to the value of `n`. The number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, as one test case has been processed.
