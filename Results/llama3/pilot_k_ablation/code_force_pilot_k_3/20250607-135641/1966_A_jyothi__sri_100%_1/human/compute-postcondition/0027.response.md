Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is an empty list, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the initial list arrC and each value is the frequency of that integer in the list, ans is k - 1 if any integer in arrC has a frequency of at least k, otherwise ans is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the answer which is k-1 if any integer in arrC has a frequency of at least k, otherwise an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 499 inclusive. The values of n, k, arrC, hashmap, and ans remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains t test cases, which is one less than the initial number of test cases. The answer being printed is still k-1 if any integer in arrC has a frequency of at least k, otherwise an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
