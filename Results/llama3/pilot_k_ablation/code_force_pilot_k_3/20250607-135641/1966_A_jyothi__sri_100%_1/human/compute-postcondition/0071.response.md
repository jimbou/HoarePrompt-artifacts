Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.***
