Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the value of the key `i` is incremented by 1, `ans` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `i` is the second integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `ans`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the `hashmap` dictionary, where the value of the key `i` (which is the second integer in the list) is incremented by 1.
