Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `arrC` and the value is 1, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and `i` is the first integer in the list `arrC` and is now in `hashmap`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The `hashmap` now contains one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list `arrC` and the value is 1. The first integer in the list `arrC` is now in the `hashmap`. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
