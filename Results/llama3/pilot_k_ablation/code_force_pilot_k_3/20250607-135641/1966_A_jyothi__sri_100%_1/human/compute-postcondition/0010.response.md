Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer `i` in the list `arrC` and `hashmap[i]` is at least `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`, `i` is a key in `hashmap` with a value of at least `k`, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is now `k - 1`, which is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
