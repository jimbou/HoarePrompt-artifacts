Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then hashmap[i] is at least k, ans is k - 1, and i is a key in hashmap with a value of at least k. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. stdin contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, hashmap[i] is at least k, ans is k - 1, and i is a key in hashmap with a value of at least k. Otherwise, hashmap[i] is incremented by 1. If i is not in hashmap, hashmap[i] is 1, ans is k - 1, and i is the second integer in the list arrC. In both cases, stdin contains t-1 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer `i` in the list `arrC`, `i` is the third integer in the list `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, the value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the value of `hashmap[i]` is set to 1. If the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
