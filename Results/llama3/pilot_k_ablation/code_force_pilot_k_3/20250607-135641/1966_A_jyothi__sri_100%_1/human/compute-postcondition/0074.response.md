Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` with a value of 1, `ans` is either `k - 1` or unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been updated to 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is either `k - 1` or unchanged, depending on the initial value of `hashmap[i]`.
