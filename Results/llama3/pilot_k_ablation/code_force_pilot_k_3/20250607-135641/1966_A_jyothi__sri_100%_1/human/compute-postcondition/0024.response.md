Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is an empty list, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the initial list arrC and each value is the frequency of that integer in the list, ans is k - 1 if any integer in arrC has a frequency of at least k, otherwise ans is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state is as follows:

*   The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive.
*   The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
*   The value of `k` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive.
*   The list `arrC` is now empty because the loop has iterated over all its elements.
*   The dictionary `hashmap` now contains all the integers from the initial list `arrC` as keys, and their corresponding values are the frequencies of these integers in the list.
*   The value of `ans` is `k - 1` if any integer in `arrC` has a frequency of at least `k`, otherwise, it remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive.
*   The content of `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing `t-1` test cases.
