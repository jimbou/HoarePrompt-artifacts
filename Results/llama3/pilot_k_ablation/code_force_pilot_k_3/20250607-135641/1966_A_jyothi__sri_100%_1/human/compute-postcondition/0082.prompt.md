Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, stdin contains `t` test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains `n` integers `c_1`, `c_2`, ..., `c_n` (1 <= c_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
    hashmap = {}
    ans = n
    for i in arrC:
        if i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[i] = 1
        if hashmap[i] >= k:
            ans = k - 1
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 499 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is an empty list, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the initial list arrC and each value is the frequency of that integer in the list, ans is k - 1 if any integer in arrC has a frequency of at least k, otherwise ans is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, stdin contains t test cases, and the answer which is k-1 if any integer in arrC has a frequency of at least k, otherwise an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is at least 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t test cases, and i is the last integer in the list, and the value of ans is being printed which is either k - 1 or n depending on whether hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is an empty list, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing all integers from the original list with their respective counts, `ans` is either `n` or `k - 1`, and `ans` which is either `n` or `k - 1` is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
