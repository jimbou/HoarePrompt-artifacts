Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, `ans` is `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n`, `i` is the third integer in the list, and stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.***
