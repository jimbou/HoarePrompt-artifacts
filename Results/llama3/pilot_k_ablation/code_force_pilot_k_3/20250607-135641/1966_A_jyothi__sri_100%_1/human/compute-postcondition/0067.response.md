Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` and its value is incremented by 1, if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. If the incremented value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
