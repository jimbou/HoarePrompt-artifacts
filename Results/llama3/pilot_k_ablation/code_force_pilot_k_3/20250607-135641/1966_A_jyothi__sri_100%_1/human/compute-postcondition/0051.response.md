Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the last integer in the list.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of t, n, k, and stdin remain unchanged. The list arrC has been fully traversed, and the dictionary hashmap contains key-value pairs for each unique integer in arrC, with the value representing the frequency of each integer. The variable ans is updated to k - 1 if any integer in arrC has a frequency greater than or equal to k, otherwise, it remains as n. The variable i is now the last integer in the list arrC.
