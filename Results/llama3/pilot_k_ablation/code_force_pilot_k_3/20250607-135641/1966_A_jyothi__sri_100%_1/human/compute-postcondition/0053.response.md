Output: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the last integer in the list, and the value of ans is being printed which is either k - 1 or n depending on whether hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC**
