Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, hashmap is a dictionary that contains the first integer i. If i is already a key in hashmap, hashmap[i] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, i is added to hashmap with a value of 1. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, ans is k - 1. Otherwise, no change is made to ans.***
