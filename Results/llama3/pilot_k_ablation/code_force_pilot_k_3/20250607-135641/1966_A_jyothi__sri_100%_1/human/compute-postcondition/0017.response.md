Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, hashmap[i] is at least k, ans is k - 1, and i is a key in hashmap with a value of at least k. Otherwise, hashmap[i] is incremented by 1. If i is not in hashmap, hashmap[i] is 1, ans is k - 1, and i is the second integer in the list arrC. In both cases, stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
