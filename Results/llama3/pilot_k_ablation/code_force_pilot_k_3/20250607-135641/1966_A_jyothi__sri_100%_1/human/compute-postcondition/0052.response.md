The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined by the condition `hashmap[i] >= k` for any `i` in `arrC`. If this condition is true, `ans` is `k - 1`, otherwise `ans` is `n`.

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, the value of `ans` will be either `k - 1` or `n`.

However, without knowing the exact values of `hashmap`, `arrC`, and `k`, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. But we can describe it based on the given conditions.

Output: **k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC, otherwise n (where k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive)**
