Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, `ans` is `k - 1`, `i` is the first integer in the list, `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, and stdin contains `t - 1` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `k - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, `i`, and `stdin` are still valid.
