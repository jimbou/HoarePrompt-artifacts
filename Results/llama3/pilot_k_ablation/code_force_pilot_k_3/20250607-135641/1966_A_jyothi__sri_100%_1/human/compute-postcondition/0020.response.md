Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer `i` in the list `arrC`, `i` is the third integer in the list `arrC` and the value of `hashmap[i]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arrC` remain the same as in the initial state. The dictionary `hashmap` still contains at least one key-value pair, but the value of the key `i` (which is the third integer in the list `arrC`) has been updated to 1.
