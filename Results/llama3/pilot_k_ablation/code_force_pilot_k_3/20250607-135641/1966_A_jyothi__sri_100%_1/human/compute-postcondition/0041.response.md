Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where `i` is a key with a value of 1, `ans` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t - 1` test cases, and `i` is the second integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap` has been updated to include a new key-value pair where `i` is the key and 1 is the value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases, and `i` is still the second integer in the list.
