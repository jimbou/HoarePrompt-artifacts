Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is an empty list, hashmap is a dictionary containing all integers from the original list with their respective counts, ans is either n or k - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arrC` is empty because all its elements have been processed, the dictionary `hashmap` contains all the integers from the original list with their respective counts, and the variable `ans` is either the original value of `n` or `k - 1`, depending on whether any integer in the list appeared at least `k` times. The values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
