Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the value of the key i is incremented by 1 if i is a key in hashmap, otherwise i is added to hashmap as a key with a value of 2, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the third integer in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the third integer in the list is used as a key in the hashmap. If this key already exists in the hashmap, its value is incremented by 1. If this key does not exist in the hashmap, it is added with a value of 2. The values of the other variables remain the same, and there is one less test case in the stdin.
