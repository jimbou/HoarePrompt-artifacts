The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list arrC, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arrC.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arrC has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in the list.
State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the third integer in the list. If i is a key in hashmap, the value of the key i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, i is added to hashmap as a key with a value of 1.**
