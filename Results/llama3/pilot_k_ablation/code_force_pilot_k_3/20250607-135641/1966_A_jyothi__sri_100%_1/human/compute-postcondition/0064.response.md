Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`, `ans` is `k - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` test cases. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added to `hashmap` with a value of 1. The current value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to `k - 1`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is still `t - 1`. The hashmap still contains the first integer `i` with a value greater than or equal to `k`.
