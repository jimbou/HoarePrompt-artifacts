To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in arrC:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `arrC`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `arrC` has at least one more integer. At the end of the previous iteration, `arrC` has at least 2 integers, and `i` is the second integer in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `arrC` must have at least 3 integers, and `i` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer `i` in the list `arrC`, `i` is the third integer in the list `arrC`.**
