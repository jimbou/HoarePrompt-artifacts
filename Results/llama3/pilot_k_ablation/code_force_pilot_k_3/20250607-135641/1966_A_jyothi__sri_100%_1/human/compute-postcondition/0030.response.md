The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arrC`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arrC`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, i is the first integer in the list**
