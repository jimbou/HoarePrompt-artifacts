Output State: **t is at least 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair, ans is k - 1 if hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC, otherwise ans is n, stdin contains t test cases, and i is the last integer in the list, and the value of ans is being printed which is either k - 1 or n depending on whether hashmap[i] >= k for any i in arrC**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of t is now at least 0, and there are t test cases remaining in the stdin. The values of n, k, arrC, hashmap, ans, and i are the same as before, and the value of ans is still being printed.
