Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is an empty list, `hashmap` is a dictionary containing all integers from the original list with their respective counts, `ans` is either `n` or `k - 1`, and `ans` which is either `n` or `k - 1` is being printed**.

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The printing of `ans` is still in progress.
