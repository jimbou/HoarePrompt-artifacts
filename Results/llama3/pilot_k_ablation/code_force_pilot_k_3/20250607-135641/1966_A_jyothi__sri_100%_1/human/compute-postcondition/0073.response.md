Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` with its value incremented by 1, if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`.**

The code increments the value of `hashmap[i]` by 1. The initial state of `hashmap[i]` is not specified, but since `hashmap` contains the first integer `i`, we know that `hashmap[i]` is at least 1. After incrementing, `hashmap[i]` is at least 2. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k - 1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain unchanged.
