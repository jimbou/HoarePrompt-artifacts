Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, hashmap is a dictionary that contains the first integer i. If i is already a key in hashmap, hashmap[i] is incremented by 1. Otherwise, i is added to hashmap with a value of 1. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, ans is k - 1. Otherwise, no change is made to ans.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list. `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, its value is incremented by 1. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, it is added with a value of 1. If `hashmap[i]` is less than `k`, `ans` is either `k - 1` or unchanged. After the if else block executes, `ans` will be `k - 1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` will be either `k - 1` or unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
