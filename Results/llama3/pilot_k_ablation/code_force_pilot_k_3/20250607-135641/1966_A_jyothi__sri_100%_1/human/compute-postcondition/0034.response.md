Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, hashmap is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first integer in the list and the value is 1, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and i is the first integer in the list.**

In this output state, the code has added a new key-value pair to the hashmap dictionary, where the key is the first integer in the list (i) and the value is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t - 1 test cases, and the first integer in the list (i) is now a key in the hashmap dictionary with a value of 1.
