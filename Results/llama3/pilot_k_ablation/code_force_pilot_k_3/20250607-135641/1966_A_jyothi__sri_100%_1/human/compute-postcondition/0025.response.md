Based on the precondition, the code will print the value of `ans`, which is determined by the frequency of integers in the list `arrC` and the value of `k`.

Since `arrC` is an empty list, there are no integers to count frequencies for. Therefore, the condition "any integer in `arrC` has a frequency of at least `k`" is never true.

As a result, the value of `ans` will be an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, which is the default value when the condition is not met.

Output: **an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive**
