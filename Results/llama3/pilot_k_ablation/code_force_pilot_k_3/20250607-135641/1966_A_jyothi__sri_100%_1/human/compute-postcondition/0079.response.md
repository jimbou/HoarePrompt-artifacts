Based on the initial state, we can analyze the print statement as follows:

* `ans` is either `n` or `k - 1`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, we can conclude that `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive.

Therefore, the print statement will output the value of `ans`, which is either `n` or `k - 1`.

Output: **either n (an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive) or k - 1 (an integer between 1 and 99 inclusive)**
