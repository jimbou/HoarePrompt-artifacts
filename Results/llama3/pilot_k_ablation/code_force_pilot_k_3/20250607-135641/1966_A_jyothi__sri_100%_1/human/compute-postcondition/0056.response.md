Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is n, stdin contains t - 1 test cases**

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to n and k, respectively. It then reads a list of n integers from stdin, assigning it to arrC. The hashmap is initialized as an empty dictionary, and the variable ans is set to n. The value of t is not modified, so it remains greater than 0. The value of i is not used in this code snippet, so its value is not affected. The stdin now contains t - 1 test cases.
