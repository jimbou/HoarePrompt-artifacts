The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arrC`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arrC`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arrC` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `arrC`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, k is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first integer i in the list arrC. If hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then hashmap[i] is at least k, ans is k - 1, and i is a key in hashmap with a value of at least k. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is the second integer in the list arrC**
