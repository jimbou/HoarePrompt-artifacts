The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list arrC, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arrC.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arrC has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in the list.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `arrC` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k - 1`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.**
