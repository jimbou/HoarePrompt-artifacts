The code accepts two space-separated integers from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively. The stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, there are `t-1` lines left in the stdin after reading the first line.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9)**
