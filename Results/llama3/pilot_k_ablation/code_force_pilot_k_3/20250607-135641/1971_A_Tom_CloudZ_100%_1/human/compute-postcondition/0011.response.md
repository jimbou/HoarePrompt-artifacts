The code prints the minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b`, which are the values of `x` and `y` from the first line of the input.

Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the minimum value between them will be the smaller of the two, and the maximum value will be the larger of the two.

Output: **min(a, b), max(a, b) (where min(a, b) is the minimum value between a and b, and max(a, b) is the maximum value between a and b)**
