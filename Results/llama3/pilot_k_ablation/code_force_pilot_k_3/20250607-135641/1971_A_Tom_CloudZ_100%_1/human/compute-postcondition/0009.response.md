The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b` are printed, the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is min(a, b) and the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is max(a, b) are being printed**
