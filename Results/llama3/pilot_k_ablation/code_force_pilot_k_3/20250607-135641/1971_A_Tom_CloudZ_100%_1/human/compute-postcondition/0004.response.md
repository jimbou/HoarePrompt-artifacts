The code prints the minimum and maximum values between the two integers `a` and `b`, where `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `b` is an integer between 0 and 9.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values between a and b are printed**
