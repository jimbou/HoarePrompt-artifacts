Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 100, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b` are printed, the minimum value between `a` and `b` which is min(a, b) and the maximum value between `a` and `b` which is max(a, b) are being printed, `a` and `b` are the values of `x` and `y` from the first line of the input.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the values of `x` and `y` from the first line of the input, and the stdin now contains `t-4` lines instead of `t-3` lines. The other variables and conditions remain the same.
