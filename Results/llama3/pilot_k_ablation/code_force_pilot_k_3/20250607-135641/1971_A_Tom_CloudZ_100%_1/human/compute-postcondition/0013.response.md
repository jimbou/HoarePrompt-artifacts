Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 100, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is `t-1`, stdin contains 0 lines, the minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b` are printed `t` times.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable `t` will be between 0 and 100, `a` and `b` will be between 0 and 9, and `_` will be equal to `t-1`. The stdin will be empty, containing 0 lines. The minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b` will be printed `t` times.
