Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values between a and b are printed**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` are unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two space-separated integers from the input. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y` (0 <= x, y <= 9), since one line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b` are printed.
