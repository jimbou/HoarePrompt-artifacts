The `print` statement will print the minimum and maximum values between the integers `a` and `b`.

Since `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `b` is also an integer between 0 and 9, the minimum value between `a` and `b` will be the smaller of the two integers, and the maximum value will be the larger of the two integers.

Therefore, the output will be the minimum value between `a` and `b`, followed by the maximum value between `a` and `b`.

Output: **min(a, b) (where min(a, b) is the minimum value between a and b), max(a, b) (where max(a, b) is the maximum value between a and b)**
