Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case. It takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum of x and y, followed by the maximum of x and y. The program uses the built-in min() and max() functions in Python, which correctly determine the minimum and maximum of two numbers.

The program also handles edge cases correctly. For example, when x and y are equal, the program outputs x (or y) twice, which is the correct output. When x and y are both 0, the program outputs 0 0, which is also correct.

The program also handles negative numbers correctly, although the problem description does not explicitly mention negative numbers, the code will work correctly for negative numbers as well.

The program also handles the case when the input is not an integer, although the problem description does not explicitly mention this, the code will throw an error if the input is not an integer, which is the correct behavior.

Overall, the program is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case and handles edge cases correctly.
