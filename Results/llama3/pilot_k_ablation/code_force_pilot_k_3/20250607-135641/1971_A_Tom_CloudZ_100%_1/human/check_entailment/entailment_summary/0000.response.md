Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum values of pairs of integers. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` correctly using `int(input())`.
2. It then iterates `t` times using a `for` loop, which is correct.
3. Inside the loop, it reads a pair of integers `a` and `b` using `map(int, input().split())`, which is correct.
4. It then prints the minimum and maximum values of the pair using `print(min(a, b), max(a, b))`, which is correct.

The program's logic is straightforward and aligns with the problem description. It correctly reads the input, processes the pairs of integers, and prints the desired output.

Correctness: **True**
