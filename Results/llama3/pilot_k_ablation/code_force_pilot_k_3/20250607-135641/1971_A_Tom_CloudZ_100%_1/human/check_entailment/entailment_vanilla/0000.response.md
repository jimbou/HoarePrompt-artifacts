Reasoning:

1. The problem requires reading the number of test cases (t) and then iterating through each test case.
2. In each test case, two integers (x and y) are read, and the minimum and maximum of these two integers need to be output.
3. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates through each test case using a for loop.
4. Inside the loop, it reads two integers (a and b) using the `map()` function and the `split()` method, which is correct.
5. The program then uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum of the two integers, respectively, and prints them.
6. The program does not handle any potential errors that might occur during input reading, but since the problem assumes valid inputs, this is not a concern.

Correctness: **True**
