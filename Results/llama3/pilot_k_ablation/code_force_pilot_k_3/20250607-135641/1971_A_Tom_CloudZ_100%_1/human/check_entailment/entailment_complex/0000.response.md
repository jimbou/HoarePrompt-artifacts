Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum values of pairs of integers. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` from the input, then iterates `t` times to read pairs of integers `a` and `b`. For each pair, it prints the minimum and maximum values using the built-in `min` and `max` functions.

The program correctly handles the input format, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains a pair of integers. The use of `map(int, input().split())` is correct to read the pair of integers and convert them to integers.

The logic of the program is also correct. It uses the `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values of each pair, which is the expected output.

The program does not have any syntax errors, and the variable names are clear and concise.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
