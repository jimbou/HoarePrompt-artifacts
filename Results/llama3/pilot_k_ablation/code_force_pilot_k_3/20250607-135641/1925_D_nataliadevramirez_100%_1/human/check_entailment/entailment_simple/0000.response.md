Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the number of children `n`, the number of pairs of friends `p`, and the number of excursions `k`.
2.  It calculates the sum `S` of the initial friendship values for all pairs of friends.
3.  It calculates the total number of possible pairs `C` using the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
4.  It calculates the numerator `num` and denominator `den` for the expected value of the sum of friendship values. The numerator takes into account the increase in friendship values over time, and the denominator represents the total number of possible pairs.
5.  It calculates the greatest common divisor `g` of `num` and `den` to simplify the fraction.
6.  It calculates the modular multiplicative inverse `den` of `2 * C * C` modulo `MOD` to avoid division by zero and to ensure the result is within the required range.
7.  Finally, it calculates the answer `ans` by multiplying `num` and `den` modulo `MOD` and prints the result.

The program correctly implements the mathematical formulas and modular arithmetic required to solve the problem. It also handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
