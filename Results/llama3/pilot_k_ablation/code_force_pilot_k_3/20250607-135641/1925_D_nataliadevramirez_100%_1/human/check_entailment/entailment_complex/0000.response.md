Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving expected values of friendship pairs in a class. The program reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates a value based on these inputs using modular arithmetic and prints the result for each test case.

The program correctly implements the necessary calculations, including the sum of the third integer in each line (S), the value of C as n*(n-1)/2, the numerator and denominator of a fraction, and the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator. It also correctly reduces the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor and takes the result modulo MOD.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program:

1.  The program assumes that the input is well-formed and does not contain any errors. In a real-world scenario, it would be a good idea to add some error checking to handle potential issues with the input.
2.  The program uses a variable named `p` to represent the number of pairs of friends, which could potentially be confused with the mathematical concept of probability. It might be clearer to use a different variable name.
3.  The program uses the `math.gcd` function to calculate the greatest common divisor of the numerator and denominator. This function is not necessary in this case, as the numerator and denominator are already relatively prime (i.e., they have no common factors other than 1). However, using `math.gcd` does not affect the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected results for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
