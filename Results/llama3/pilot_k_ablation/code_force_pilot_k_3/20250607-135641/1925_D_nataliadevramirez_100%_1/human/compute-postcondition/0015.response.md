The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If `p` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `p-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `p` must be greater than 0.

State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is 0, `i` is 0, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `p-1`**
