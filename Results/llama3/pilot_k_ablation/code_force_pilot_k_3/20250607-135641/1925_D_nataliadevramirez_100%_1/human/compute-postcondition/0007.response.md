The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `p` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `p` must be greater than 1.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `p` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer in the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 2**
