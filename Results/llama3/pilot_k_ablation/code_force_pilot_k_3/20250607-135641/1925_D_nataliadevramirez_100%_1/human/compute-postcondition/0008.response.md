Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `p` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer in the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2**

The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` increases the value of `S` by the third integer in the input. Since `S` was already increased by the third integer in the input, its new value is the sum of the original value and the new third integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus four, as one more input has been consumed.
