Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, each containing three integers n, m, and k, followed by m lines of three integers a_i, b_i, and f_i. It calculates a value based on these inputs using modular arithmetic and prints the result for each test case. The function performs the following actions: reads input, calculates the sum of the third integer in each line, computes the value of C as n*(n-1)/2, calculates the numerator and denominator of a fraction, reduces the fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator, multiplies the numerator by the modular multiplicative inverse of the denominator, takes the result modulo MOD, and prints the final result for each test case.**
