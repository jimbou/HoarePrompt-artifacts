Output State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` is the second integer in the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S`, `i` is 1, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2*C*C` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-2.**

In this output state, the value of `S` has been updated by adding the third integer from the input to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has read one line of input from stdin, which contained three integers, and has updated the value of `S` accordingly.
