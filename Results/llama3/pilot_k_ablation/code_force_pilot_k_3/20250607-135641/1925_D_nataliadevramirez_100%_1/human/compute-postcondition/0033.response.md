Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of S, i is p, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the values of the variables have been updated accordingly. The loop counter `i` has reached the value of `p`, which means the loop has executed `p` times. The variable `S` has accumulated the sum of the third integer in the input and its previous value for `p` iterations. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
