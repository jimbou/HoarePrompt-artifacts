The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the result of the expression `(num*den) % MOD`. 

Here, `num` is the result of the expression `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, where `p` is the second integer in the input, `k` is the third integer in the input, `C` is the result of the expression `n*(n-1)/2`, and `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S`. 

`den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2*C*C` modulo `MOD`, where `MOD` is 1000000007.

So, the value of `ans` is the result of multiplying `num` and `den` and taking the modulus with `MOD`.

Output: **the result of the expression (num*den) % MOD, where num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C) and den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD**
