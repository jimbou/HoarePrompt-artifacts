Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input, k is the third integer in the input, S is 0, i is p-1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the result of the modular multiplicative inverse of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) modulo MOD, calculated using the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD)**

The code block assigns the first three integers from the input to `n`, `p`, and `k`, respectively. It then initializes `S` to 0. The values of `T`, `_`, `MOD`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `ans`, and `g` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus `p-1`.
