The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `T` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of all the third integers in the input, i is p-1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the result of the modular multiplicative inverse of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) modulo MOD, calculated using the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD)**
