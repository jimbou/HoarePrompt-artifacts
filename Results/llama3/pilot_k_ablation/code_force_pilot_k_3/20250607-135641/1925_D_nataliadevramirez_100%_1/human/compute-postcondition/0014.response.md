Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input, k is the third integer in the input, S is 0, i is p-1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `p`, and `k` have been updated to the first, second, and third integers in the input, respectively. The value of `S` has been reset to 0. The values of `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `ans`, and `g` remain unchanged, as they were not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 1.
