Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of all the third integers in the input, i is p-1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1.**

The code snippet modifies the values of several variables. The first line recalculates the value of `C` based on the current values of `n`. The second line recalculates the value of `num` based on the current values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. The third line calculates the value of `den` based on the current value of `C`. The fourth line calculates the greatest common divisor `g` of `num` and `den`. The fifth and sixth lines update the values of `num` and `den` by dividing them by `g`. The seventh line calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD`. The eighth line calculates the final value of `ans` by multiplying `num` and `den` and taking the modulus `MOD`. The values of `T`, `_`, `MOD`, `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
