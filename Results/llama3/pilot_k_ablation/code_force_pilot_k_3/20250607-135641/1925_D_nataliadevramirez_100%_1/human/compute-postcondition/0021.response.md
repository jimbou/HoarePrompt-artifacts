Output State: **T is greater than 1, _ is 1, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of all the third integers in the input, i is p-1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached `p-1`, and the variable `S` has accumulated the sum of all the third integers in the input. The other variables remain unchanged.
