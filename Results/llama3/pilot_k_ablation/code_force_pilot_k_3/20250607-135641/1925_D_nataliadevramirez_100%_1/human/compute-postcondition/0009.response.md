Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `p` is 0, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer in the input for `p` times, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus `p`, `i` is `p-1`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `S` has been increased by the third integer in the input for `p` times, and the variable `i` has reached `p-1`. The number of test cases in `stdin` has decreased by `p`. The values of `T`, `_`, `MOD`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged.
