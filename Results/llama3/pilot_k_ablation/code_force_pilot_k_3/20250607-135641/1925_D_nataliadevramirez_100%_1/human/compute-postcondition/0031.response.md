The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `p` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `p` must be greater than 2.
State: **`T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` is the second integer in the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S`, `i` is 2, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2*C*C` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-2**
