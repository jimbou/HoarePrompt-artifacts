Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `p` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer in the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `S` is increased by the third integer in the input, which is accepted from the stdin. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
