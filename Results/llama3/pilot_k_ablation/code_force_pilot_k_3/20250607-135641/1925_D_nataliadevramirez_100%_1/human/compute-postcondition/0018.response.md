Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` must be greater than 1, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S`, `i` is 1, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `p-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `T`, `_`, `MOD`, `n`, `p`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `ans`, and `g` remain the same as before. The value of `S` is updated to be the sum of the third integer in the input and its previous value. The stdin now contains one less test case.
