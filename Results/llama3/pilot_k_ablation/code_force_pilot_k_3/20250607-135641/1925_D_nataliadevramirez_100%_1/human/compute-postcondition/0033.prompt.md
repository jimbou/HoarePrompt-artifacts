Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input, k is the third integer in the input, S is 0, i is p-1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the result of the modular multiplicative inverse of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) modulo MOD, calculated using the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(p):
    S += int(input().split()[2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is greater than 2, _ is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input and must be greater than 0, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of S, i is 0, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the result of the modular multiplicative inverse of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) modulo MOD, calculated using the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD)

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` is the second integer in the input and must be greater than 1, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S`, `i` is 1, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2*C*C` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` is the second integer in the input and must be greater than 2, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S`, `i` is 2, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2*C*C` modulo `MOD`, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-3




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
