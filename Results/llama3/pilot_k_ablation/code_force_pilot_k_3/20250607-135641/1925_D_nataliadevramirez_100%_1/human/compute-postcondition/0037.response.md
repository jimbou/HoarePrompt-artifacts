Output State: **T is 0, _ is T, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of S, i is p, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the result of the expression (num*den) % MOD, and num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD)**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `_` will be equal to the initial value of `T`, which is the number of test cases minus one. The value of `T` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `n`, `p`, `k`, `S`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, `ans`, and `g` will be the same as in the previous iteration, but `stdin` will contain multiple test cases minus `p`, where `p` is the number of inputs read in the last iteration. The final value of `ans` will be printed, which is the result of the expression `(num*den) % MOD`, where `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)` and `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of `2*C*C` modulo `MOD`.
