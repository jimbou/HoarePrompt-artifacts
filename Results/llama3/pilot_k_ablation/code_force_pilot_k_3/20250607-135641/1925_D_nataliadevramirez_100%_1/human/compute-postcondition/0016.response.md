Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` must be greater than 0, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S`, `i` is 0, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `p`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `S` has been updated to be the sum of the third integer in the input and its previous value. The values of all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The number of test cases in the input has been reduced by 1.
