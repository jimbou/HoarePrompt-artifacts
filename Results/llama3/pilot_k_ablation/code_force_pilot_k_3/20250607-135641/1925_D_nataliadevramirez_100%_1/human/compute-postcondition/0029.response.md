The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `p` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `p` must be greater than 1.
State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input and must be greater than 1, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of S, i is 1, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-2, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the result of the modular multiplicative inverse of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) modulo MOD, calculated using the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD)**
