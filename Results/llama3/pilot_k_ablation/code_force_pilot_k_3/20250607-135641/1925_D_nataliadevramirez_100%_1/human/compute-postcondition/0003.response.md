To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `p`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `p`. If `p` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states of other variables do not guarantee that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust the state of `p` to be at least 1 and `i` to be 0 (since it will start from 0 in the range).

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is an integer, `p` is at least 1, `k` is an integer, `S` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
