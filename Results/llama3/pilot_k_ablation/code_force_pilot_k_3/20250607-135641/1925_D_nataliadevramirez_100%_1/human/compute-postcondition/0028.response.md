Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input and must be greater than 0, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of S, i is 0, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p-1, and ans is printed, ans (where ans is the result of the modular multiplicative inverse of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) modulo MOD, calculated using the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD)**

In this output state, the value of S has been updated to include the third integer in the input, which is added to the previous value of S. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus p-1, indicating that one test case has been processed.
