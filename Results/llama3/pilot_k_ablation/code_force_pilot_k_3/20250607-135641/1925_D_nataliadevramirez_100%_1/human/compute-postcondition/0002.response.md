Output State: **T is greater than 0, _ is 0, MOD is 1000000007, n is an integer, p is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `p`, and `k`, respectively. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by one. The variable `S` is initialized to 0. The values of `T`, `_`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.
