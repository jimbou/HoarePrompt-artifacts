Output State: **`T` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `MOD` is 1000000007, `n` is the first integer in the input, `p` must be greater than 2, `k` is the third integer in the input, `S` is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of `S` plus the new third integer in the input, `i` is 2, `C` is `n*(n-1)/2`, `num` is `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C)`, `den` is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, `ans` is `(num*den) % MOD`, `g` is the greatest common divisor of `(p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)` and `(2*C*C)`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus `p-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `S`, which is updated to be the sum of the third integer in the input and its previous value plus the new third integer in the input. The number of test cases in stdin is also reduced by 1.
