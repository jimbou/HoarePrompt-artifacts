To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `T`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `T` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, MOD is 1000000007 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, MOD is 1000000007**
