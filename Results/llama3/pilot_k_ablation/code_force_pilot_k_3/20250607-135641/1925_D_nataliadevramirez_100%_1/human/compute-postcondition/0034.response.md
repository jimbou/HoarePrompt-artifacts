Output State: **T is greater than 2, _ is 2, MOD is 1000000007, n is the first integer in the input, p is the second integer in the input and must be greater than or equal to 0, k is the third integer in the input, S is the sum of the third integer in the input and the previous value of S, i is p, C is n*(n-1)/2, num is (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S)/(2*C*C), den is the modular multiplicative inverse of 2*C*C modulo MOD, ans is (num*den) % MOD, g is the greatest common divisor of (p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S) and (2*C*C), and stdin contains multiple test cases minus p.**

The code block modifies the values of C, num, den, ans, and g. The first line recalculates C as n*(n-1)/2. The second line calculates num as p*k*k-p*k+2*k*C*S. The third line calculates den as 2*C*C. The fourth line calculates g as the greatest common divisor of num and den. The fifth and sixth lines divide num and den by g, respectively. The seventh line calculates den as the modular multiplicative inverse of den modulo MOD. The eighth line calculates ans as (num*den) % MOD. The values of T, _, MOD, n, p, k, S, i, and stdin remain unchanged.
