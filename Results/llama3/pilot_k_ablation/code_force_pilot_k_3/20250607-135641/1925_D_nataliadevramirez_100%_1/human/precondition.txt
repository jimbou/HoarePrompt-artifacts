t is a positive integer, for each test case, n is a positive integer greater than 1, m is a non-negative integer such that m <= min(10^5, n*(n-1)/2), k is a positive integer, and for each of the m pairs of friends, a_i and b_i are positive integers less than or equal to n, f_i is a positive integer less than or equal to 10^9, and a_i is not equal to b_i.
