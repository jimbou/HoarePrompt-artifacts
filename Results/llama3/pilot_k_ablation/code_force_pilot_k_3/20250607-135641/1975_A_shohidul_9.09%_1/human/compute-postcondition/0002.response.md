The code snippet provided consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from the input to `a`. The third line checks if all elements in the list `a` are in increasing order.

After the execution of the code, the value of `n` is an integer, and the value of `a` is a list of integers. The value of `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order.

Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order**
