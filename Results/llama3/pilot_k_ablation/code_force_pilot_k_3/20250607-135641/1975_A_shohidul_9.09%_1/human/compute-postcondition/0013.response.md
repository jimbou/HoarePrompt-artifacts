Output State: **t is at least 1, n is an integer and is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order and its current value is true, i is 1, new is a list of integers that is a subset of a starting from index 1, new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are in increasing order and its current value is true, 'YES' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is at least 1, n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, check_all is true indicating that all elements in a are in increasing order, i is 1, new is a list of integers that is a subset of a starting from index 1, new_all is true indicating that all elements in new are in increasing order, 'YES' has been printed, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
