Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, and check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. The third line checks if all elements in `a` are in increasing order and assigns the result to `check_all`. The value of `t` is not affected by the code.
