Postcondition: **t is at least 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, and check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if check_all is false, 'YES' is printed if a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both true, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.**
