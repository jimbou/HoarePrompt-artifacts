The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `check_all` is True if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, False otherwise, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `new` is a slice of list `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, False otherwise.**
