Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 3, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, new_all is True if all elements in new are in non-decreasing order, False otherwise, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their original values, and the program has exited the current loop or if statement.
