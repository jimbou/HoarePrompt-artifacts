Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 2, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, new is a slice of list a starting from index 2, new_all is True if all elements in new are in non-decreasing order, False otherwise.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains at least 2, and `n` remains an integer equal to the input value and greater than 2. The list `a` remains unchanged, containing `n` integers from the input. The value of `check_all` is determined by whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 2 (stored in `new`) are less than the first element of `a`. The value of `_` remains 1, and `stdin` remains empty. The value of `i` remains 2. The slice of `a` starting from index 2 is stored in `new`. The value of `new_all` is determined by whether all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order.
