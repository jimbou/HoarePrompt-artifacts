Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3 are in increasing order, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then if both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
