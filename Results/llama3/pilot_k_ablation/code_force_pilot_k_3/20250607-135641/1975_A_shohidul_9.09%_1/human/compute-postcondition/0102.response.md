Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `check_all` is True if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]`, False otherwise, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, `new` is a slice of list `a` starting from index 2, `new_all` is True if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order, False otherwise, and 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, `check_all`, `_`, `i`, `new`, and `new_all` retain their initial values, and 'YES' is still being printed.
