The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `a[i:]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index `i`, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order, `i` is 3**
