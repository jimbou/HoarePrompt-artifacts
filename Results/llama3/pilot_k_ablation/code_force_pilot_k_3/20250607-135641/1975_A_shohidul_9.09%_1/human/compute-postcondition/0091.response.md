Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is True, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, new is a slice of list a starting from index i, new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are in increasing order and its current value is True, 'YES' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t is at least 2, the value of n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, the list a contains n integers from the input, the variable check_all is True, the variable _ is 1, the standard input is empty, the value of i is 1, the variable new is a slice of list a starting from index i, the variable new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are in increasing order and its current value is True, 'YES' has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
