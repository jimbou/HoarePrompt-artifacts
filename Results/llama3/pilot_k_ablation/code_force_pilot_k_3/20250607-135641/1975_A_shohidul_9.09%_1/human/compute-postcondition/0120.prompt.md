Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 49). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    check_all = all([(a[i - 1] < a[i]) for i in range(1, n)])
    if check_all:
        print('YES')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n):
            if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
                new = a[i:]
                check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
                new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len
                    (new))])
                if check_all and new_all:
                    print('YES')
                    break
                else:
                    print('NO')
                    break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, and check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. If check_all is False, we check if a[i - 1] > a[i] for i = n-1. If true, a new list new is created as a subset of a starting from index i, and a boolean new_all is set to indicate whether all elements in new are in increasing order. If both check_all and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, and check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order. If check_all is true, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if check_all is false, 'YES' is printed if a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both true, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, check_all is updated to True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
