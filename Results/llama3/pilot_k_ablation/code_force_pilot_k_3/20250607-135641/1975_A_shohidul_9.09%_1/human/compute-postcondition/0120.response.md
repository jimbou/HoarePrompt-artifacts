Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, _ is t, stdin is empty. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, check_all is updated to True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], nothing changes.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `t` will be 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of `n` and `a` will remain the same as the input values. The value of `check_all` will be a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order. If `check_all` is True, 'YES' will be printed. If `check_all` is False, the loop will check if `a[i - 1] > a[i]` for `i = n-1`. If true, a new list `new` will be created as a subset of `a` starting from index `i`, and a boolean `new_all` will be set to indicate whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order. If both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, 'YES' will be printed and the loop will break. Otherwise, the loop will break without printing anything. If `a[i - 1]` is not greater than `a[i]`, no changes will be made. The value of `_` will be equal to the initial value of `t`, and `stdin` will be empty.
