Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, and check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then either 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `check_all` and `new_all` are True, or 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `check_all` or `new_all` is False. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, n is at least 3, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean indicating whether a[0] is greater than all elements in a[i:], new is a sublist of a starting from index i, new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are in increasing order, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `a[i:]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then if `check_all` and `new_all` are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
