Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `a[i:]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order, `i` is 3, 'YES' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
