Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `i` is 1. If `a[i - 1]` is greater than `a[i]`, then either 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if both `check_all` and `new_all` are True, or 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if either `check_all` or `new_all` is False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
