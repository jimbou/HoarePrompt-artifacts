The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers from the input, `check_all` is either True or False, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**
