Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is an integer and is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean indicating whether the first element of a is greater than all elements in the slice of a starting from index 2, new is a slice of a starting from index 2, new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in the slice of a starting from index 2 are in increasing order, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
