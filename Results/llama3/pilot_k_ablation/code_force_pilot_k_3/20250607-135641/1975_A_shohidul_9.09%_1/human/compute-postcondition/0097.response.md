Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is either True or False, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then check_all and new_all are evaluated. If both are True, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no action is taken.***
