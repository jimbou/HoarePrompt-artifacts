Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is True, `i` is 1, `new` is a list of integers, `new_all` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'YES' is being printed**.

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state because the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The program still prints 'YES' as it was doing before the break statement.
