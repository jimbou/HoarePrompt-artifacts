Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is an integer and is greater than 1, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then a new list new is created as a subset of a starting from index 1, and a boolean new_all is set to indicate whether all elements in new are in increasing order. If both check_all and new_all are true, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no changes are made.***
