Output State: **t is at least 2, n is at least 2, a is a list of integers, check_all is False, i is 1, new is a list of integers, new_all is True**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns a slice of the list `a` starting from index `i` to the variable `new`. Since `i` is 1, `new` will contain all elements of `a` except the first one.

The second line updates the value of `check_all` by checking if all elements in `new` are less than the first element of `a`. Since the element at index `i-1` in `a` is greater than the element at index `i` in `a`, and `i` is 1, the first element of `a` is greater than the first element of `new`. Therefore, `check_all` becomes False.

The third line assigns the result of checking if all elements in `new` are in increasing order to the variable `new_all`. Since the element at index `i-1` in `a` is greater than the element at index `i` in `a`, and `i` is 1, the first element of `new` is less than or equal to the second element of `new`. This pattern continues for all elements in `new`, making `new_all` True.

The values of `t` and `n` are not affected by the code, so they remain at least 2. The list `a` is also not modified, so it remains a list of integers. The variable `i` is not updated, so it remains 1.
