The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2, so for the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `t` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `a` are in increasing order, `_` is 1**
