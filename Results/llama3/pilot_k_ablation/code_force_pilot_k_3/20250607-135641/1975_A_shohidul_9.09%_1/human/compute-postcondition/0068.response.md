Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is at least 3, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean indicating whether a[0] is greater than all elements in a[i:], new is a sublist of a starting from index i, new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are in increasing order, i is 2. If a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.***
