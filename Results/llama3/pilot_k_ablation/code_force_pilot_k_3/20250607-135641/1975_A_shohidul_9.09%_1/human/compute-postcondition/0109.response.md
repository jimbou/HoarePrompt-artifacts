Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 3, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, new_all is True if all elements in new are in non-decreasing order, False otherwise.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `new`, `check_all`, and `new_all`. The first line assigns a slice of list `a` starting from index `i` (which is 3) to `new`. The second line checks if all elements in `new` are less than `a[0]` and assigns the result to `check_all`. The third line checks if all elements in `new` are in non-decreasing order and assigns the result to `new_all`. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, `_`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
