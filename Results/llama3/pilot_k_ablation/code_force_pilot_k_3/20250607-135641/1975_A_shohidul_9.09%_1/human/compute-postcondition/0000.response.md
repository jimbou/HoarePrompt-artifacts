Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 49). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).**

In this output state, `t` is assigned the value of the first input integer, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but the first test case has been consumed. Each remaining test case still contains two lines, with the first line containing a single integer n (1 <= n <= 49) and the second line containing n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6).
