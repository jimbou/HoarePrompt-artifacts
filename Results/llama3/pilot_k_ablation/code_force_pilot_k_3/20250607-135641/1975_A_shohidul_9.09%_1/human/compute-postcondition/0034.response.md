Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer and is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3 are in increasing order, `i` is 3, 'YES' is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether the first element of `a` is greater than all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new` is a slice of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in the slice of `a` starting from index 3 are in increasing order, `i` is 3, 'YES' is printed, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
