Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It checks if the integers are in increasing order. If they are, it prints 'YES'. If not, it checks if the remaining integers (after the first decreasing pair) are in increasing order and all less than the first integer. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.**
