Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, i is n-1. If a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing and the value of `i` is now `n-1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true and both `check_all` and `new_all` are true, then 'YES' is printed and the loop breaks. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is true and either `check_all` or `new_all` is false, then 'NO' is printed and the loop breaks. If the condition `a[i - 1] > a[i]` is false, then no action is taken.
