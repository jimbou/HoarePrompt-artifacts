Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `check_all` is a boolean indicating whether `a[0]` is greater than all elements in `a[i:]`, `new` is a sublist of `a` starting from index 3, `new_all` is a boolean indicating whether all elements in `new` are in increasing order, `i` is 3. If `a[i - 1] > a[i]`, then if `check_all` and `new_all` are both true, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i - 1] <= a[i]`, no action is taken.***
