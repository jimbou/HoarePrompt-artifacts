Postcondition: **t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is either True or False, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, new is a slice of list a starting from index i, new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are in increasing order. If check_all is True and new_all is True, 'YES' has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
