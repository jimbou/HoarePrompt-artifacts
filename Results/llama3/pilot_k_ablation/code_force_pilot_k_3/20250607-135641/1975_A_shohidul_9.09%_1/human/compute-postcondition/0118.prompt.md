Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, _ is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[i - 1] > a[i]:
        new = a[i:]
        check_all = all([(a[0] > new[i]) for i in range(len(new))])
        new_all = all([(new[i - 1] <= new[i]) for i in range(1, len(new))])
        if check_all and new_all:
            print('YES')
            break
        else:
            print('NO')
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is either True or False, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 1. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then check_all and new_all are evaluated. If both are True, 'YES' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. If a[i - 1] is not greater than a[i], no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 2, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, new is a slice of list a starting from index 2, new_all is True if all elements in new are in non-decreasing order, False otherwise. If a[i - 1] > a[i] and check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 3, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 3, new is a slice of list a starting from index 3, new_all is True if all elements in new are in non-decreasing order, False otherwise. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], nothing changes.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
