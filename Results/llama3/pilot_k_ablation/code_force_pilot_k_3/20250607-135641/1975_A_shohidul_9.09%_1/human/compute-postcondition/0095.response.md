Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value and greater than 1, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is False, _ is 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, new is a slice of list a starting from index i, new_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in new are in increasing order, and either check_all is False or new_all is False, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
