Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a list of n integers from the input, check_all is a boolean indicating whether all elements in a are in increasing order, _ is 1, stdin is empty. If check_all is True, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, check_all is updated to True if all elements in new are less than a[0], False otherwise. If a[i - 1] > a[i], then if check_all and new_all are both True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If a[i - 1] <= a[i], nothing changes.***
