Postcondition: ***t is at least 2, n is at least 2, a is a list of integers, i is 1, new is a list of integers, new_all is True. If both check_all and new_all are True, 'YES' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, either check_all is False or new_all is False, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
