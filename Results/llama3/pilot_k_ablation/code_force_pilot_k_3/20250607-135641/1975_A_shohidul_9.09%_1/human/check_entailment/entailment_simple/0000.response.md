Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing a specific operation. The operation involves splitting the array into two parts and swapping them.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the array and the array elements.

The program then checks if the array is already sorted in increasing order using the `all` function with a generator expression. If the array is already sorted, it prints 'YES'.

If the array is not sorted, the program iterates over the array to find the first pair of elements that are in decreasing order. When it finds such a pair, it splits the array into two parts at that point and checks two conditions:

1.  If all elements in the second part are less than the first element of the first part.
2.  If the second part is sorted in non-decreasing order.

If both conditions are true, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. It correctly handles the scenario where the array can be sorted by swapping the two parts and also handles the scenario where the array cannot be sorted.

Correctness: **True**
