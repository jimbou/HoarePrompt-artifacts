Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if an array can become sorted in non-decreasing order after performing the specified operation. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first checks if the array is already in increasing order. If it is, it prints 'YES' and moves on to the next test case.

2. If the array is not in increasing order, it finds the first pair of elements that are in decreasing order. It then checks if the remaining elements (after the first decreasing pair) are in increasing order and all less than the first integer. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the array can be split into two parts and swapped to become non-decreasing. It checks if the remaining elements (after the first decreasing pair) are in increasing order and all less than the first integer, which is the condition for the array to become non-decreasing after swapping.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where the array cannot be made non-decreasing by swapping. If the remaining elements (after the first decreasing pair) are not in increasing order or not all less than the first integer, it prints 'NO'.

5. The program processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.

Correctness: **True**
