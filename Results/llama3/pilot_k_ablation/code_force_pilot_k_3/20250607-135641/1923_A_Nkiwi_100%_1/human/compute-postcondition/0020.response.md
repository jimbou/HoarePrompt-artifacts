Output State: **`sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `cnt0` is 1, `i` is `sIdx`. The current value of `arrs[i]` is 0**

The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1, so its new value is 1. The other variables are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same. The relationship between `sIdx` and `eIdx` is still valid, and the current value of `arrs[i]` is still 0.
