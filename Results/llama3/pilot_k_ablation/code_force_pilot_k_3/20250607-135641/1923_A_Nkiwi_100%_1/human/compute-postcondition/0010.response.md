To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:`

1. `eIdx >= 0`: This condition is already satisfied since `eIdx` is set to `length - 1`, which is a non-negative value.
2. `arrs[eIdx] == 0`: This condition needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Since `eIdx` is `length - 1`, we need to ensure that the last element of `arrs` is 0.

To guarantee that the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `arrs` so that its last element is 0.

State: **`sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, and `arrs` must have at least one 0 element at its last index**
