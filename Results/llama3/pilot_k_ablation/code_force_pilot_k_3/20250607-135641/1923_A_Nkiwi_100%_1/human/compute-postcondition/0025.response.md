To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, and `sIdx` is less than `eIdx`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `sIdx` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.
* `eIdx` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.
* `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now `sIdx + 2`.

The other variables, `arrs` and `cnt0`, are not part of the loop head, so their states are not adjusted.

State: **`sIdx` is less than `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `i` is `sIdx + 2`, `cnt0` is unchanged**
