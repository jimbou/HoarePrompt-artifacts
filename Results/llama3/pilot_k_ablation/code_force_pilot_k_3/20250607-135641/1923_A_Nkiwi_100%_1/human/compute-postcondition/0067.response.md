According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx]`. If `sIdx` is less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is 2, `length` is greater than 0, `arrs[sIdx]` is 0. `length` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `length` is greater than 2. `arrs[sIdx]` being 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arrs[sIdx]` is 0 and `arrs[sIdx+1]` is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`length` is greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is 2, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, and `_` is 1**
