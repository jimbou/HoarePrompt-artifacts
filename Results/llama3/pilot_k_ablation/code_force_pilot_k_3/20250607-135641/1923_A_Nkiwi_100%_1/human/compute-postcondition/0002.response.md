Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 test cases, length is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arrs is a list of integers between 0 and 1, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1 as one test case is processed. The value of `length` is assigned the value of the first integer in the test case, which is between 2 and 50 (inclusive). The `arrs` list is populated with the remaining integers in the test case, which are between 0 and 1. The `sIdx` and `eIdx` variables are assigned the values 0 and `length - 1`, respectively.
