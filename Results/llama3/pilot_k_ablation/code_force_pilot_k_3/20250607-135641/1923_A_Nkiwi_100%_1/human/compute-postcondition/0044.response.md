To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`, as they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is `length - 3` and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `eIdx` to be greater than or equal to 0, which means `length` must be greater than or equal to 3. We also need to ensure that `arrs[eIdx]` is still 0.

State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is the smallest index such that `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is greater than 1, `length` must be greater than or equal to 3, `arrs` is a list of integers with `arrs[eIdx]` being 0, `stdin` is empty**
