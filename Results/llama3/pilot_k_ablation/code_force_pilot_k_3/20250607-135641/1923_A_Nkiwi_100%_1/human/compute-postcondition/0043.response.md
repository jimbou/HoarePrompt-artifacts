Output State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is the smallest index such that `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `eIdx` is `length - 3`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` must be greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers with `arrs[eIdx]` being 0, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length - 3`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `length`, `t`, and `arrs` are still valid. The value of `i` is still `eIdx+1`, which is now `length - 2`. The value of `cnt0` is still the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx]`, but the subarray has changed due to the decrement of `eIdx`.
