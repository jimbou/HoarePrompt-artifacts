Output State: **`sIdx` is less than `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `sIdx` and `eIdx` remain unchanged, and their relationship remains the same. The value of `i` is still `sIdx + 1`, and the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1.
