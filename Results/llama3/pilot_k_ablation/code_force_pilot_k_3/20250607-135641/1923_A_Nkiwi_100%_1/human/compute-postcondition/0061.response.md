The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, sIdx is the smallest index such that arrs[sIdx] is not 0, eIdx is greater than or equal to -1, t is greater than 0, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] which is cnt0 is being printed, _ is 1**
