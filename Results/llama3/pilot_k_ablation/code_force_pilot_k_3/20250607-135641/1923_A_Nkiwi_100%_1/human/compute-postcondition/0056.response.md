Output State: **`cnt0` is 2 or 3 if `arrs[i]` is 0, otherwise `cnt0` is 1 or 2. `i` is `sIdx + 2`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx + 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2 or 3 if the current element in the list `arrs` at index `i` is 0, otherwise it becomes 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The index `i` is still `sIdx + 2`, and the relationship between `sIdx` and `eIdx` remains the same. The value of `t` is still greater than 1, and the length of the list `arrs` is still an integer. The standard input `stdin` is still empty.
