Output State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` and `eIdx` remain unchanged.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `cnt0` will hold the count of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), the loop counter `i` will be one past the last index of the subarray (`eIdx+1`), and the values of `sIdx` and `eIdx` will remain the same as they were before the loop started.
