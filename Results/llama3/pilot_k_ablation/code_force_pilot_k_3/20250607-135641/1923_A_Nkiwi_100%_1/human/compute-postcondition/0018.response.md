According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx` and `eIdx`. If `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or length if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, or -1 if all elements in `arrs` are 0, and `cnt0` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `eIdx` and `i` is now `sIdx`.

State: **`sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `cnt0` is 0, `i` is `sIdx`**
