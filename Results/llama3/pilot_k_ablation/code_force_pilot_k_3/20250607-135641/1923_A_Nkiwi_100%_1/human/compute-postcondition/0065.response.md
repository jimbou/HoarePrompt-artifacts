To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `sIdx` is less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is 1, `length` is greater than 0, and `arrs[sIdx]` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `sIdx` to be less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` to be 0. Since `sIdx` is already 1, we can keep it as is. However, we need to ensure that `arrs[sIdx]` is still 0.

Since `arrs` is a list of integers with the first element being 0, we can keep the first element as 0. However, we need to ensure that the second element (at index 1) is also 0, so that `arrs[sIdx]` is 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first two elements being 0, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1**
