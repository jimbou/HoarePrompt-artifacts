Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers between 0 and 1 where the first element must be 0, `sIdx` is less than `length` and is one more than its previous value, `eIdx` is `length - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, but it is still less than `length`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-2` test cases. The list `arrs` still contains integers between 0 and 1, with the first element being 0. The value of `eIdx` is still `length - 1`.
