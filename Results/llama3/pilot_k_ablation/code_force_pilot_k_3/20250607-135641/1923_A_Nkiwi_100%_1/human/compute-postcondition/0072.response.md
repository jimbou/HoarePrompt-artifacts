To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is `length - 2` and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. To ensure the loop can execute again, `eIdx` needs to be greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` needs to be 0.

State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with its last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1, `arrs[eIdx]` is 0**
