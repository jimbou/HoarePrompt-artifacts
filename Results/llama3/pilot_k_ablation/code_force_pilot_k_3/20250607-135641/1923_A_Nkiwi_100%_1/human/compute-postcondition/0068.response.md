Output State: **`length` is greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is 3, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, and `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `length` is greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first three elements being 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, and `_` is 1 is still valid.
