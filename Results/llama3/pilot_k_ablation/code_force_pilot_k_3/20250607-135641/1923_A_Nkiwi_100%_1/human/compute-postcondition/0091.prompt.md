Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sIdx = 0
    eIdx = length - 1
    while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:
        sIdx += 1
    while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
        eIdx -= 1
    cnt0 = 0
    for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):
        if arrs[i] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    print(cnt0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` and `eIdx` remain unchanged, and the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, sIdx is the smallest index such that arrs[sIdx] is not 0, eIdx is greater than or equal to -1, t is greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] which is cnt0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: length is greater than 0, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is the index of the last non-zero element in arrs, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, t is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] has been printed, _ is 1, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] which is cnt0 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
