To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx]` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `sIdx < length` and `arrs[sIdx] == 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, and `length` is greater than 0. Since `sIdx` is already 1, it does not need to be adjusted. However, `arrs[sIdx]` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is 0.

State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx+1:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers and `arrs[sIdx]` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
