Output State: **sIdx is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in arrs, or length if all elements in arrs are 0, eIdx is length - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the start index `sIdx` will be equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in the array `arrs`. If all elements in `arrs` are 0, then `sIdx` will be equal to `length`. The end index `eIdx` remains unchanged at `length - 1`.
