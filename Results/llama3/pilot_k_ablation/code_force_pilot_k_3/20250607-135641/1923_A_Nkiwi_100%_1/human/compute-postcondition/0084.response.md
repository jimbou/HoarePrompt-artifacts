Postcondition: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1, `i` is the index of the next element in `arrs`, if the current value of `i` is the index of the first zero element in `arrs`, then `cnt0` is 2 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0.**
