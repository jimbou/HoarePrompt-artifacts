Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers between 0 and 1 where the first element must be 0 and `arrs[sIdx]` must be 0, `sIdx` is less than `length - 1` and is two more than its previous value, `eIdx` is `length - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now two more than its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
