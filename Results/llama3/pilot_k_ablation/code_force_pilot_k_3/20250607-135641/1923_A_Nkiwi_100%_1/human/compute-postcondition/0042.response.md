To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]` since these are the variables in the loop head.

1. `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to 0 for the loop to execute again.
2. `arrs[eIdx]` must be 0 for the loop to execute again.

Considering the current state, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, which means `length` must be greater than 1 to ensure `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 after the next iteration. `arrs[eIdx]` is already 0, so no adjustment is needed for this condition.

State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is the smallest index such that `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` must be greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers with `arrs[eIdx]` being 0, `stdin` is empty**
