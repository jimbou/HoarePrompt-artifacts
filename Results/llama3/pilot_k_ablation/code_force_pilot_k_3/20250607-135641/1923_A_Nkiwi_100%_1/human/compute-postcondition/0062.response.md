Output State: **length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, t is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] which is cnt0 is being printed, _ is 1**

In this output state, the code has modified the values of `length`, `arrs`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`. The `length` variable now holds an integer value read from the input. The `arrs` variable is a list of integers read from the input. The `sIdx` variable is set to 0, and the `eIdx` variable is set to `length - 1`. The `cnt0` variable remains the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`. The `i` variable is still `eIdx+1`. The `t` variable remains greater than 0. The `stdin` is empty after reading the input. The `_` variable remains 1.
