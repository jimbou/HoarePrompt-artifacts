Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: length is greater than or equal to 0, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is length - 1, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, t is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] which is cnt0 has been printed, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
    eIdx -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with its last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with its last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+2]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+2]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with its last element being 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+2]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+2]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
