Output State: **`sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or length if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, or -1 if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `cnt0` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `sIdx` and `eIdx` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduced a new variable `cnt0` and assigned it the value 0.
