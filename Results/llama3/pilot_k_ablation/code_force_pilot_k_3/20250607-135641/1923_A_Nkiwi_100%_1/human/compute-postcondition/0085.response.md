The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, sIdx and eIdx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `sIdx` and `eIdx`. If `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the next element in `arrs`, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1, `i` is the index of the next element in `arrs` increased by 1, if the current value of `i` is the index of the first zero element in `arrs`, then `cnt0` is 2 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0**
