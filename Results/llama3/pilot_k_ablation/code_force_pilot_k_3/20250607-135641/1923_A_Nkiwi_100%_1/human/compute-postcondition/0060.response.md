Output: **cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, sIdx is the smallest index such that arrs[sIdx] is not 0, eIdx is greater than or equal to -1, t is greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] which is cnt0 is being printed**
