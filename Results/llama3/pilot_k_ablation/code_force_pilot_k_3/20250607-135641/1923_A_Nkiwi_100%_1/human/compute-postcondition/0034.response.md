Output State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx+1:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, changing the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` to `arrs[sIdx+1:eIdx+1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
