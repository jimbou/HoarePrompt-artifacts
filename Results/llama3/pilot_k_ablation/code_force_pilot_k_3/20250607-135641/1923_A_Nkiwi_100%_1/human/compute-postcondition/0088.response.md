Output State: **length is greater than 0, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is the index of the last non-zero element in arrs, cnt0 is the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, t is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] has been printed, _ is 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the length of the array is greater than 0, the array is a list of integers, the start index is the index of the first non-zero element in the array, the end index is the index of the last non-zero element in the array, the count of zeros is equal to the number of zeros in the array from the start index to the end index, the current index is one more than the end index, the input is greater than 0, the standard input is empty, and the number of zeros in the array from the start index to the end index has been printed. The value of the variable _ remains 1.
