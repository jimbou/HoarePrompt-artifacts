The variables in the loop head are `eIdx` and `arrs`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `eIdx` and `arrs`. If `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is `length - 3`, and `arrs` must have at least two 0 elements at its last two indices. For the loop to execute again, `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to 0, and `arrs[eIdx]` must be 0. Since `eIdx` is `length - 3`, it is already greater than or equal to 0 if `length` is greater than or equal to 3. However, we need to ensure that `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. Since `arrs` must have at least two 0 elements at its last two indices, we need to adjust the state of `arrs` to have at least three 0 elements at its last three indices.

State: **`sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 3`, and `arrs` must have at least three 0 elements at its last three indices**
