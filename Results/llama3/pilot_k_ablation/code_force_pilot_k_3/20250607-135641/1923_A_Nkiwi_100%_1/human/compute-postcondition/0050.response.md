Output State: **`cnt0` is 1, `i` is `sIdx`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `arrs[i]` is 0, `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `arrs[i]` is still 0.
