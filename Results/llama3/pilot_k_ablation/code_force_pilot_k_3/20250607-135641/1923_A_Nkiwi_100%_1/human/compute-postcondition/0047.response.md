Output State: **cnt0 is 0, i is eIdx+1, sIdx is the smallest index such that arrs[sIdx] is not 0, eIdx is greater than or equal to -1, t is greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of cnt0 has been reset to 0, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The variable cnt0, which previously represented the number of zeros in the subarray arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], now has a value of 0. The other variables retain their original values and properties, including i being equal to eIdx+1, sIdx being the smallest index such that arrs[sIdx] is not 0, eIdx being greater than or equal to -1, t being greater than 1, length being an integer, and arrs being a list of integers. The stdin remains empty.
