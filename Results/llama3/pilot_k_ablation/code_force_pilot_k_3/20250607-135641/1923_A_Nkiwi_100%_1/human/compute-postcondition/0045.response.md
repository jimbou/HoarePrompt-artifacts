Output State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx]`, `i` is `eIdx+2`, `sIdx` is the smallest index such that `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `t` is greater than 1, `length` must be greater than or equal to 3, `arrs` is a list of integers with `arrs[eIdx]` being 0, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `i` has been updated to `eIdx+2` to maintain the relationship between `i` and `eIdx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
