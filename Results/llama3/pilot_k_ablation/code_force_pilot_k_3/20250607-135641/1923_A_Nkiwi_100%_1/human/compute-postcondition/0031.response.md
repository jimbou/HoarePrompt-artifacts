The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` and `eIdx` remain unchanged, and the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` is being printed, `t` must be greater than 1**
