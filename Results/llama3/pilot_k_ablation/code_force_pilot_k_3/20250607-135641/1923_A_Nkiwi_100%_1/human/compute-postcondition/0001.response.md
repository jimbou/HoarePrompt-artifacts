To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable in this context, but we'll consider its state as the iteration number). Since the loop will execute `t` times, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1), _ is 0**
