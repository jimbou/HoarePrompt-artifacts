Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 test cases, length is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), arrs is a list of integers between 0 and 1, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1
Code of the loop:
while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:
    sIdx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `arrs` is a list of integers between 0 and 1 where the first element must be 0, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers between 0 and 1 where the first element must be 0, `sIdx` is less than `length` and is one more than its previous value, `eIdx` is `length - 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers between 0 and 1 where the first element must be 0 and `arrs[sIdx]` must be 0, `sIdx` is less than `length - 1` and is two more than its previous value, `eIdx` is `length - 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
