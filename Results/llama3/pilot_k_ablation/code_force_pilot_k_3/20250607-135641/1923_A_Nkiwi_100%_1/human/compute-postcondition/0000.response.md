Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 50) followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i <= 1)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first integer from the input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each consisting of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n. The values of the other variables are not affected.
