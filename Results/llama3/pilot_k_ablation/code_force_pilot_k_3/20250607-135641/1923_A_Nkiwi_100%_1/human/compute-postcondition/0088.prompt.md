Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: length is greater than 0, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is the index of the last non-zero element in arrs, cnt0 is 0, i is eIdx+1, t is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] has been printed, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):
    if arrs[i] == 0:
        cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1. If the current value of `i` is the index of the first zero element in `arrs`, then `cnt0` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `cnt0` and `arrs[i]` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1, `i` is the index of the next element in `arrs`, if the current value of `i` is the index of the first zero element in `arrs`, then `cnt0` is 2 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1, `i` is the index of the next element in `arrs` increased by 1, if the current value of `i` is the index of the first zero element in `arrs`, then `cnt0` is 3 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` is 2 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
