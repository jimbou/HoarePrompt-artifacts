Output State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is 2, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers and `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `arrs[sIdx]` is 0 is no longer valid, but `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0.
