Output State: **`sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, and `arrs` must have at least one 0 element at its last index**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length - 2`. The values of `sIdx` and `arrs` remain unchanged, with `sIdx` still representing the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` (or `length` if all elements are 0), and `arrs` still having at least one 0 element at its last index.
