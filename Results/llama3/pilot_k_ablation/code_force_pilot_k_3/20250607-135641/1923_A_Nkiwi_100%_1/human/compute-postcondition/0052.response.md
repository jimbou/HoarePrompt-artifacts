To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `sIdx`, and `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is `sIdx + 1`
* `sIdx` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head
* `eIdx` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head

The other variables, `cnt0`, `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `stdin`, are not modified in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`cnt0` is 0 or 1, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty**
