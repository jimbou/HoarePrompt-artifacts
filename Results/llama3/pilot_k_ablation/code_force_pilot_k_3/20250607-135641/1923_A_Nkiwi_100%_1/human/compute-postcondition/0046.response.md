Output State: **cnt0 is the number of zeros in the subarray arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1], i is eIdx+1, sIdx is the smallest index such that arrs[sIdx] is not 0, eIdx is greater than or equal to -1, t is greater than 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is the smallest index such that `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, and `stdin` is empty.
