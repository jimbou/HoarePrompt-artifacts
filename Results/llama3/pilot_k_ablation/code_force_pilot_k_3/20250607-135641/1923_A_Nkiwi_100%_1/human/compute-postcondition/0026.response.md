The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. The initial state of `cnt0` is unchanged, which means its value is not specified. However, we can still express the new value of `cnt0` in terms of its previous value.

Output State: **`sIdx` is less than `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `i` is `sIdx + 2`, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 from its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state means that the relationship between `sIdx` and `eIdx` remains the same, and the value of `i` is still 2 more than `sIdx`. The only change is that the value of `cnt0` has increased by 1 from its previous value, but its exact value is still unknown.
