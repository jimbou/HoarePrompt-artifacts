To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0`.

1. **`sIdx < length`**: This condition requires that `sIdx` is less than `length`. Since `sIdx` is 0 and `length` is an integer, this condition is already satisfied for the first iteration because 0 is less than any positive integer. However, to ensure this condition holds true for the first iteration, we should note that `length` must be greater than 0.

2. **`arrs[sIdx] == 0`**: This condition requires that the element at index `sIdx` in `arrs` is 0. Since `sIdx` is 0, we need the first element of `arrs` to be 0 for the loop to execute the first time.

Given these conditions, the states that need adjustment are:

- `length` must be greater than 0.
- The first element of `arrs` must be 0.

Other states mentioned (`arrs` being a list of integers, `eIdx` being `length - 1`, `cnt0` being the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` being `eIdx+1`, `t` being greater than 0, `stdin` being empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` being printed, `_` being 1) do not affect the execution of the first iteration of the `while` loop based on the loop head conditions.

State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first element being 0, `sIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` is being printed, `_` is 1**
