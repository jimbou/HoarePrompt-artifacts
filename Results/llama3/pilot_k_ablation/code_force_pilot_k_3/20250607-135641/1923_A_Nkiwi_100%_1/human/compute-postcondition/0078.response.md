According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx` and `eIdx`. If `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `eIdx+1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `sIdx`. 

State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 0, `i` is `sIdx`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1**
