Output State: **sIdx is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in arrs, or length if all elements in arrs are 0, eIdx is the index of the last non-zero element in arrs, or -1 if all elements in arrs are 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `sIdx` remains the same as the initial state, which is the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or the length of `arrs` if all elements are 0. On the other hand, `eIdx` will be the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, or -1 if all elements in `arrs` are 0. This is because the loop continues to decrement `eIdx` as long as the element at `eIdx` is 0, and stops when it encounters a non-zero element or reaches the beginning of the array.
