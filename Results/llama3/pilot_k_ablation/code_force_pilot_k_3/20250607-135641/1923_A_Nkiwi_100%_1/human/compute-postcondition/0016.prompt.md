Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sIdx is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in arrs, or length if all elements in arrs are 0, eIdx is length - 1.
Code of the loop:
while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
    eIdx -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, and `arrs` must have at least one 0 element at its last index
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 3`, and `arrs` must have at least two 0 elements at its last two indices.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 4`, and `arrs` must have at least three 0 elements at its last three indices


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
