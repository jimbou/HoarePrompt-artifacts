Output State: **length is greater than 0, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is the index of the last non-zero element in arrs, cnt0 is 0, i is eIdx+1, t is greater than 0, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] has been printed, _ is 1**

In this output state, the value of cnt0 has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The length is still greater than 0, arrs is still a list of integers, sIdx and eIdx still represent the indices of the first and last non-zero elements in arrs, i is still eIdx+1, t is still greater than 0, stdin is still empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] has already been printed. The value of _ remains 1.
