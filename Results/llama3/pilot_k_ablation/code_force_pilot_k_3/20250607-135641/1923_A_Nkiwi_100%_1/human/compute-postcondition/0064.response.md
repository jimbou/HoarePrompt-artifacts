Output State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with the first element being 0, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1**

The code increments the value of `sIdx` by 1, so its new value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `sIdx` was 0 is no longer valid, but the other preconditions are still valid. The output state reflects the updated value of `sIdx` and the fact that the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed.
