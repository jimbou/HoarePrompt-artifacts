Output State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1, `i` is the index of the next element in `arrs`, if the current value of `i` is the index of the first zero element in `arrs`, then `cnt0` is 2 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0. Otherwise, `cnt0` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length is still greater than 0, and the list of integers, start index, end index, and value of t remain unchanged. The standard input is still empty, and the number of zeros in the specified range of the list has been printed. The value of `_` is still 1. The index `i` still points to the next element in the list. If `i` is the index of the first zero element, then the count of zeros `cnt0` is incremented to 2, and the current element at index `i` is 0. If `i` is not the index of the first zero element, then `cnt0` is still 1, and the current element at index `i` is 0.
