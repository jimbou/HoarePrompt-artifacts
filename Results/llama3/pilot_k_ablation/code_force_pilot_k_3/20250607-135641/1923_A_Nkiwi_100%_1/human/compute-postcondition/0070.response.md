To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0`.

1. **`eIdx >= 0`**: Since `eIdx` is already defined as `length - 1`, and `length` is greater than or equal to 0, `eIdx` will always be greater than or equal to -1. However, for the loop to execute, `eIdx` must be at least 0. Given that `length` is already greater than or equal to 0, `eIdx` being `length - 1` will always meet this condition if `length` is greater than 0. Thus, we need to ensure `length` is greater than 0.

2. **`arrs[eIdx] == 0`**: For this condition to be true, the last element of `arrs` (since `eIdx` is the last index) must be 0. Since `arrs` is a list of integers and `eIdx` is `length - 1`, we need to ensure that the last element of `arrs` is 0.

Given these conditions, the states that need adjustment are:

- `length` must be greater than 0 to ensure `eIdx` is at least 0.
- The last element of `arrs` must be 0 to satisfy `arrs[eIdx] == 0`.

Other states like `sIdx`, `cnt0`, `i`, `t`, `stdin`, and `_` do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute the first time, given the conditions in the loop head.

State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with its last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1**
