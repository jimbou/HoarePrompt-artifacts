Output State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with its last element being 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+2]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+2]` which is `cnt0` has been printed, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
