Output State: **`sIdx` is equal to the smallest index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, or `length` if all elements in `arrs` are 0, `eIdx` is `length - 3`, and `arrs` must have at least two 0 elements at its last two indices.**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length - 3`. The values of `sIdx` and `arrs` remain unchanged, and the condition that `arrs` must have at least two 0 elements at its last two indices still holds.
