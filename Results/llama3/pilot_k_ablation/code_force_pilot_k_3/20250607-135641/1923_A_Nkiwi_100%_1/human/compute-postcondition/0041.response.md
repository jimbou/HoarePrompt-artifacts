Output State: **`cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx]`, `i` is `eIdx+1`, `sIdx` is the smallest index such that `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` must be greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers with `arrs[eIdx]` being 0, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `length - 2`. The value of `i` is still `eIdx+1`, but since `eIdx` has changed, `i` is now `length - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` now ends at `eIdx`, which is `length - 2`, and `cnt0` is still the number of zeros in this subarray. The list `arrs` still has `arrs[eIdx]` being 0, but now `eIdx` is `length - 2`.
