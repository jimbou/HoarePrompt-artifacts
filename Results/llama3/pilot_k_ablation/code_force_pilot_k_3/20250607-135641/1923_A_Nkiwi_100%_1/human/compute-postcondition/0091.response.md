Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, and the number of zeros in arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] has been printed for all test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing for all test cases, and the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed for each test case. The variable `t` has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed, and the standard input `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input data has been consumed.
