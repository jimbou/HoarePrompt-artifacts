According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx` and `length` and `arrs`. If `sIdx` is less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is 1, `length` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and `arrs[sIdx]` is 0. `length` being between 2 and 50 (inclusive) does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `length` is greater than 1. `sIdx` being 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `sIdx` is less than `length`. `arrs[sIdx]` being 0 does ensure that the loop will execute again, so it does not need to be adjusted. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers between 0 and 1 where the first element must be 0, `sIdx` is less than `length`, `eIdx` is `length - 1`**
