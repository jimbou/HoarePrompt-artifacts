Postcondition: ***`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `t` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, and the number of zeros in `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` has been printed, `_` is 1. If the current value of `i` is the index of the first zero element in `arrs`, then `cnt0` is 1 and the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `cnt0` and `arrs[i]` remains unchanged.***
