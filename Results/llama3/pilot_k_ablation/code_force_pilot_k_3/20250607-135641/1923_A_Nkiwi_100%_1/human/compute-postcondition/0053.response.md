Output State: **`cnt0` is 1 or 2, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `t` is greater than 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it can be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
