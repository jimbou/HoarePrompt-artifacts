Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips in such a way that they form a single block, without any free cells between them.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  The program first finds the start and end indices of the block of chips by iterating from the beginning and end of the array, respectively, until it finds a non-zero element.
2.  It then counts the number of zeros within this block, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips together.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

*   If the block of chips is already contiguous, the program will correctly output 0, as no operations are needed.
*   If there are zeros within the block of chips, the program will correctly count the number of zeros and output the minimum number of operations required to move the chips together.
*   If the input array contains only zeros, the program will correctly output 0, as there are no chips to move.

Overall, the program is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
