Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input: It reads the number of test cases `t`, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array itself `arrs`.

2. It correctly finds the start and end indices of the block of chips: It uses two while loops to find the start index `sIdx` and end index `eIdx` of the block of chips. The start index is the first index from the left where a chip is found, and the end index is the last index from the right where a chip is found.

3. It correctly counts the number of zeros in the block of chips: It uses a for loop to count the number of zeros in the block of chips, which is the number of operations needed to move the chips together.

4. It correctly prints the result: It prints the count of zeros in the block of chips for each test case.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and it handles the input and output correctly.

Correctness: **True**
