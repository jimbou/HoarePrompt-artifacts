Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of moving chips in a ribbon to form a single block without any free cells between them. The program reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the count of zeros in a specific range of a binary array for each test case.

The program correctly implements the following steps:

1.  Reads the number of test cases (`t`) and the length of the ribbon (`n`) for each test case.
2.  Reads the binary array (`arrs`) representing the ribbon for each test case.
3.  Finds the start index (`sIdx`) of the first chip (1) in the array by iterating from the beginning until a 1 is found.
4.  Finds the end index (`eIdx`) of the last chip (1) in the array by iterating from the end until a 1 is found.
5.  Counts the number of zeros (`cnt0`) in the range `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, which represents the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

The program correctly handles the constraints mentioned in the problem, including:

*   `1 <= t <= 1000` (number of test cases)
*   `2 <= n <= 50` (length of the ribbon)
*   `0 <= a_i <= 1` (binary array elements)
*   At least one cell contains a chip in each test case

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to move the chips to form a single block.

Correctness: **True**
