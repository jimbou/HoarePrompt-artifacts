Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the given conditions. The issue lies in the line `ans = ans + n // b + 1`. This line incorrectly assumes that for each value of b, all values of a from 1 to n // b + 1 satisfy the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b). However, this is not the case.

A counterexample is when n = 10 and m = 8. The program will output 14, but the correct answer is 13. The pair (10, 2) is counted by the program, but it does not satisfy the condition because 10 + 2 = 12 is not a multiple of 2 * gcd(10, 2) = 2 * 2 = 4.

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of a and b, and check if the condition a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a, b) is satisfied. This can be done using the math.gcd function in Python to calculate the greatest common divisor of a and b.
