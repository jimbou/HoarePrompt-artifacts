To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for T in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `T`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `T` must be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `T` is 1
* `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (no change)

The other variables, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `b`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than or equal to `min(n, m)`, `ans` is `ans + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`**
