Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines of input, each line containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, ans is 0, b is not defined**

Explanation:
The first line reads a line from stdin, which contains two positive integers n and m, and assigns them to the variables n and m. This reduces the number of lines in stdin by 1, leaving t-2 lines. The second line converts the strings n and m to integers. The third line initializes the variable ans to 0, overwriting its previous value. The variable b is not defined in the given code snippet, so its value remains undefined.
