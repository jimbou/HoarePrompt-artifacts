Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `ans` is `ans + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is still 1, `stdin` still contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, `n` is still a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is still a positive integer that is at least 2, `ans` has been updated to be `ans + n // 2 + 1`, and `b` is still 2.
