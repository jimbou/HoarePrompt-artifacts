The first line reads a line from stdin and splits it into two strings, assigning them to `n` and `m`. Since stdin contains `t` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, `n` and `m` become the first pair of integers from the input. The second line converts `n` and `m` to integers. The third line initializes `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, T is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6), n and m are positive integers, ans is 0**
