To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 3.

The loop condition is `b` in `range(1, min(n, m) + 1)`, which means `b` should be less than or equal to `min(n, m)`. Since `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The states of `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `ans`, and `n` and `m` are not directly affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3**
