Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`, `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `ans` is `ans + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `n // 3 + 1`, where `n` is the positive integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still 3, and the input in `stdin` remains the same.
