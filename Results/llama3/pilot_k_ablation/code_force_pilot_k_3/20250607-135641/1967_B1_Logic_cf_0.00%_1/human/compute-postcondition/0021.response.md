The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the terms calculated as `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m) + 1`, where `n` and `m` are positive integers that are at least `min(n, m)`. The value of `ans` is the sum of these terms for `t-2` pairs of `n` and `m` read from stdin.

Output: **sum of (n // b + 1) for each b in range from 1 to min(n, m) + 1, for t-2 pairs of n and m read from stdin**
