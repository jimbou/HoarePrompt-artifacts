To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` is indeed at least 1.

However, we need to adjust the state of `T` to ensure the loop can execute. Since `T` is the loop variable, it should start from 0 (the first iteration) and go up to `t-1` (the last iteration).

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, stdin contains `t` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6)**
