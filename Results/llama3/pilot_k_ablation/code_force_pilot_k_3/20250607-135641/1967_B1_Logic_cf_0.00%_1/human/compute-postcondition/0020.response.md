Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `m` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `ans` is `ans + sum(n // b + 1 for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1))`, `b` is `min(n, m)`**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `b`. The loop iterates over the range of `min(n, m)` and updates the value of `ans` by adding the sum of `n // b + 1` for each iteration. The final value of `b` is `min(n, m)`, which is the last value in the range. The values of `t`, `T`, and the input lines in stdin remain unchanged.
