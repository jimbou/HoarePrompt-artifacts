The code prints the value of `ans` which is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + ... + n // min(n, m) + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `m` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, and `min(n, m)` is the minimum of `n` and `m`.

Output: ** `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `m` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + ... + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`, and the value of `ans` is being printed**
