Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than 1, `ans` is `ans + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // 2 + 1` to its previous value. The values of `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, and `b` remain unchanged.
