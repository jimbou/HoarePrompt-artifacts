The `print(ans)` statement will print the calculated value of `ans`, which is a sum of terms involving the positive integers `n` and `m`.

Based on the precondition, `n` and `m` are positive integers with `n` being at least `min(n, m)` and `m` being at least `min(n, m)`. The value of `ans` is calculated as `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + ... + n // min(n, m) + 1`.

Since the exact values of `n` and `m` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated sum.

Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of terms involving n and m, calculated as n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + ... + n // min(n, m) + 1)**
