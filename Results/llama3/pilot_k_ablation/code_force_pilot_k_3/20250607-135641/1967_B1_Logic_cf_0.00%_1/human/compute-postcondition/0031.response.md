Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `m` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + ... + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the sum of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `min(n, m)`, plus 1 for each of these divisions. The value of `b` is `min(n, m)`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all integers from 1 to `min(n, m)`. The other variables, `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, and `m`, remain unchanged.
