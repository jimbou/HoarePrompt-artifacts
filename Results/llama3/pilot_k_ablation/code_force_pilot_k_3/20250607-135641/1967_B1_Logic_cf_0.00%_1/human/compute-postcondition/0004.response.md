Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than 0, `ans` is `ans + n // 1 + 1`, `b` is 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the integer division of `n` by `b` (which is 1) plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, each with two positive integers `n` and `m`.
