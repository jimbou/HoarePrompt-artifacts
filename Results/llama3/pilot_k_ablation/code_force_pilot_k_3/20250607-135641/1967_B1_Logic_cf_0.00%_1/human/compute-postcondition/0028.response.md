Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, where `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`.
