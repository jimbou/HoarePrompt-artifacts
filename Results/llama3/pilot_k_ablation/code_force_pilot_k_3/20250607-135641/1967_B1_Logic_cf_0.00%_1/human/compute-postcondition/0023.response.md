The only variable in the loop head is variable T, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable T and t. If T is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, T is 1, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again T must be increased by 1 so T is 2 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `m` is a positive integer that is at least `min(n, m)`, `ans` is `ans + sum(n // b + 1 for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1))`, `b` is `min(n, m)`, and the sum of the terms `n // b + 1` for each `b` in the range from 1 to `min(n, m) + 1` is being printed**
