To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 2, and `n` and `m` are positive integers with a minimum value greater than 1.

To adjust the states, we need to consider the following:

* `b` needs to be incremented by 1 to execute the loop again.
* `n` and `m` must have a minimum value greater than 2 to ensure that `min(n, m) + 1` is greater than 2.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than 2, `ans` is `ans + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 3**

Note that the state of `ans` is not adjusted, as it is not an object in the loop head.
