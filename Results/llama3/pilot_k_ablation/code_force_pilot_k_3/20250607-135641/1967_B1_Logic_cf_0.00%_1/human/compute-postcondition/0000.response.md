Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing two positive integers n and m (1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input from stdin, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The remaining lines of input in stdin, which are t in number, each contain two positive integers n and m, where n and m are between 1 and 2 * 10^6.
