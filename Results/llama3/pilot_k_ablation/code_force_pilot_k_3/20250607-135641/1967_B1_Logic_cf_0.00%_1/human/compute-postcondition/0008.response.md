Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than 2, `ans` is `ans + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // 3 + 1` to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`. The minimum value of `n` and `m` is still greater than 2.
