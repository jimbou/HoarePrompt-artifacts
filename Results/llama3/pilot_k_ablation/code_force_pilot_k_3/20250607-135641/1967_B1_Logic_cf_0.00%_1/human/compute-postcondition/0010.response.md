The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the results of the expression `n // min(n, m) + 1` for each pair of positive integers `n` and `m` read from `stdin`, where `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
Output: **ans (where ans is the sum of the results of the expression n // min(n, m) + 1 for each pair of positive integers n and m read from stdin)**
