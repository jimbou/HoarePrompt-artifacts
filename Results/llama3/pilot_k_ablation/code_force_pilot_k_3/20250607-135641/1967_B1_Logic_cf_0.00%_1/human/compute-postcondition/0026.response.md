The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its current value. Since `b` is 1, `n // b` is equal to `n`. Therefore, `ans` is updated by adding `n + 1` to its current value. The current value of `ans` is 0, so `ans` is updated to `0 + n + 1`, which is equal to `n + 1`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. `t` is still an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is still 2, `stdin` still contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is still a positive integer that is at least 1, `m` is still a positive integer that is at least 1, and `b` is still 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `ans` is `n + 1`, `b` is 1**
