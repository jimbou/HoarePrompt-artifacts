The only objects in the loop head are variables  b, n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `n` and `m`. If `b` is less than `min(n, m)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 1, `n` is at least 1, `m` is at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `b` is 2 and `min(n, m)` must be at least 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `ans` is `n + 1`, `b` is 2**
