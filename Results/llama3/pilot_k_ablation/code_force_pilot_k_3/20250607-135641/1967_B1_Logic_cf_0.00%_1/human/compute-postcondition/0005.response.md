The only objects in the loop head are variables  b, n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable b, n and m. If b is less than min(n, m) + 1 the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, b is 1, n and m are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time b must be 2 and n and m must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than 1, `ans` is `ans + n // 1 + 1`, `b` is 2**
