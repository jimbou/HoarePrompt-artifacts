Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 2, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `n // b + 1`, where `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `n`, `m`, and `min(n, m)` are still valid.
