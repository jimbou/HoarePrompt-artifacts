Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than or equal to `min(n, m)`, `ans` is `ans + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `t` remains unchanged, `T` remains 0, and `stdin` still contains `t-1` lines of input with two positive integers `n` and `m` each. The values of `n` and `m` must be greater than or equal to the minimum of `n` and `m`. The value of `ans` is updated to include the sum of `n` divided by the minimum of `n` and `m`, plus 1. The loop variable `b` reaches its final value, which is the minimum of `n` and `m`.
