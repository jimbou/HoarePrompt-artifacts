Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `m` is a positive integer that is at least 1, `ans` is `ans + n // b + 1`, `b` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its previous value. The value of `n` is a positive integer that is at least 1, and `b` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m`.
