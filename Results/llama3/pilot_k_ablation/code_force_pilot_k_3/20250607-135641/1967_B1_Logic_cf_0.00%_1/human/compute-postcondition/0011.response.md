The code prints the value of `ans` which is the sum of `n // min(n, m) + 1` for each pair of positive integers `n` and `m` in the `t-1` lines of input from `stdin`, where `n` and `m` are greater than or equal to `min(n, m)`.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each line containing two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 <= `n`, `m` <= 2 * 10^6), `n` and `m` are positive integers that must have a minimum value greater than or equal to `min(n, m)`, `ans` is `ans + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`, and the value of `ans` is being printed**
