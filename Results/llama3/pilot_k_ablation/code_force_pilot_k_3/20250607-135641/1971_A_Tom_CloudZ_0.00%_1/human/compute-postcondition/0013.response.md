Output State: **`_` is `t`, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin is empty, and the maximum of `a` and `b` and the minimum of `a` and `b` are being printed**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed `t` times, and the loop variable `_` has reached its final value of `t`. The variables `a` and `b` still hold the last pair of integers read from stdin, which are between 0 and 9. The stdin buffer is now empty, as all `t` lines have been read. The program is still printing the maximum and minimum of `a` and `b`, but this is the last iteration, and the loop will terminate after this.
