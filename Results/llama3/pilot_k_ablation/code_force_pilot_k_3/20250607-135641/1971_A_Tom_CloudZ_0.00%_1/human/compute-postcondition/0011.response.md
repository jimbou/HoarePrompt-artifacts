The code prints the maximum and minimum of the two integers `a` and `b`. Since `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, and `b` is also an integer between 0 and 9, the maximum of `a` and `b` will be the larger of the two integers, and the minimum of `a` and `b` will be the smaller of the two integers.

Output: **max(a, b) (which is the larger of the two integers a and b), min(a, b) (which is the smaller of the two integers a and b)**
