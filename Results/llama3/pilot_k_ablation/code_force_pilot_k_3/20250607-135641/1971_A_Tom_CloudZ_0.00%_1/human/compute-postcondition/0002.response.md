The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads a line from the input, splits it into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `a` and `b`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, the first line is read and split into `a` and `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are now integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by this code.

The stdin now contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `_` is 0, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-1` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`.**
