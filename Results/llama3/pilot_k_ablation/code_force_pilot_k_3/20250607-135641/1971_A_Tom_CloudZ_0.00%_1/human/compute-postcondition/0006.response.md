Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `_` is 1, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, stdin contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, and the maximum of `a` and `b` and the minimum of `a` and `b` are being printed**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the two space-separated integers read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two space-separated integers `x` and `y`, since one line has been read and processed. The maximum and minimum of `a` and `b` are being printed, but their values are not explicitly stated, so they are not included in the output state.
