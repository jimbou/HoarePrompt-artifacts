Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It reads the number of test cases t, then for each test case, it reads two integers x and y, and prints the maximum and minimum of the two integers. The program's behavior matches the problem description and the execution summary. The use of the built-in max and min functions in Python ensures that the correct maximum and minimum values are printed for each pair of integers.

Correctness: **True**
