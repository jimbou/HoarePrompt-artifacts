Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it prints the maximum of x and y followed by the minimum of x and y, whereas the problem description requires the minimum of x and y to be printed first, followed by the maximum of x and y.

For example, if the input is "1 9", the program will print "9 1" instead of the correct output "1 9".
