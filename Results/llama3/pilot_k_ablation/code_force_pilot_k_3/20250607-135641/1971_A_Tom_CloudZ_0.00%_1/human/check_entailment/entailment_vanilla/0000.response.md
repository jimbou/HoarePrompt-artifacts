Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y, and output them in that order.

The provided program defines a function `func()` that:

1. Reads an integer `t` from the input, which represents the number of test cases.
2. Loops `t` times, reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input in each iteration.
3. For each pair of integers, it prints the maximum of `a` and `b` followed by the minimum of `a` and `b`.

However, the problem statement specifically asks to output the minimum followed by the maximum. The program does the opposite, printing the maximum first and the minimum second.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as stated.

Correctness: **False**
