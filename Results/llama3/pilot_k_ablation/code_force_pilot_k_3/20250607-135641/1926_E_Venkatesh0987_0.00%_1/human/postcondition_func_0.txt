This function reads input from stdin, where the first input is an integer t, representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers n and k. If k is greater than half of n, it calculates a value y based on a series of operations involving n and k, and prints y. If k is less than or equal to half of n, it simply prints 2 times k minus 1. The function repeats this process for all t test cases.
