Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It first checks if the k-th card is among the odd-numbered cards. If it is, the program prints the corresponding odd number. If not, it calculates the number of cards that have been laid down in the previous iterations and then calculates the k-th card in the current iteration.

The program correctly handles the case when k is greater than the number of odd-numbered cards, and it correctly calculates the k-th card in each iteration. The use of the while loop to calculate the number of cards in each iteration is correct, and the calculation of the k-th card using the formula `y = 2 ** (i - 1) * f` is also correct.

The program also correctly handles the edge case when n is 1, and it correctly prints the only card in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases.
