According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `d`. If `s` is less than `k` and `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to `(d + 1)`, `d` is equal to `(d + 1) // 2`, `k` is an integer greater than half of the sum of `n` and 1. `d` being equal to `(d + 1) // 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `d` is greater than 0. `s` being equal to `(d + 1)` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is less than `k`. `k` being an integer greater than half of the sum of `n` and 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is greater than s, s is less than k, d is greater than 0, i is equal to 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: t - 1 pairs of integers.**
