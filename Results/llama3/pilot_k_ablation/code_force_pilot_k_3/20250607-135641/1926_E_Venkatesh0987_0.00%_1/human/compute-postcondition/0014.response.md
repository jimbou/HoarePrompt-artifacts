According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is increased by 1 and `i` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop and must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by at least 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is equal to `k`, `d` is equal to 0, `i` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop and must be at least 3, `g` is increased by half of the original value of `h` plus one, `h` is decreased by half of its original value plus one, `p` is increased by 1**
