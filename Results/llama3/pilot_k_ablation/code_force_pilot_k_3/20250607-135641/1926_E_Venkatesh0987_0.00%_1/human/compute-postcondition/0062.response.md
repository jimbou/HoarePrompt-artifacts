Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is at least 2, s is k, i is at least 2, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, f is k, y is 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the variables not affected by the loop head and body (s, d, f, and y) remain unchanged. The loop head and body only affect the variables p, g, and h. After the loop executes all the iterations, p will be equal to i, g will be equal to n, and h will be 0.
