Output State: **s is equal to k, d is equal to 0, i is equal to the number of iterations of the loop.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable s is equal to k, the variable d is equal to 0, and the variable i is equal to the number of iterations of the loop. This means that the loop has executed until the condition s < k is no longer true, and the variable d has been reduced to 0. The variable i has been incremented for each iteration of the loop, so it now represents the total number of iterations. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
