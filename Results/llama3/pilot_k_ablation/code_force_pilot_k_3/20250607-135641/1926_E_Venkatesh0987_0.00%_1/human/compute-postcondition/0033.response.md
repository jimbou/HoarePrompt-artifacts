To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `while p <= i - 1:`. This condition depends on the values of `p` and `i`.

Given the initial states:
- `n` is an integer
- `k` is an integer
- `s` is greater than or equal to `k` or `d` is 0
- `i` is greater than or equal to 1
- `d` is greater than or equal to 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0

The loop condition `p <= i - 1` must be true for the loop to execute. Given that `p` is 1, for the condition to be true, `i - 1` must be greater than or equal to 1. This implies that `i` must be greater than or equal to 2.

Since `i` is already stated to be greater than or equal to 1, we need to adjust its state to ensure it meets the condition for the loop to execute at least once. Therefore, `i` must be greater than or equal to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted as the loop condition only depends on `p` and `i`, and `p` is already set to 1, which is compatible with the adjusted state of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `s` is greater than or equal to `k` or `d` is 0, `i` must be greater than or equal to 2, `d` is greater than or equal to 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0**
