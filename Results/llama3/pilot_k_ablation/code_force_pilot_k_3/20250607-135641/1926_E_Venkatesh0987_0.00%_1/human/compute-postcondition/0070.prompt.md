Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), then t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = 0
    i = 0
    d = n
    h = n
    p = 1
    g = 0
    if k > (n + 1) // 2:
        while s < k and d > 0:
            s += (d + 1) // 2
            d -= (d + 1) // 2
            i += 1
        while p <= i - 1:
            g += (h + 1) // 2
            h -= (h + 1) // 2
            p += 1
        f = k - g
        y = 2 ** (i - 1) * f
        print(y)
    else:
        print(2 * k - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n, k, s, i, d, h, p, g are integers. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is equal to k, d is equal to 0, i is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, g is increased by half of the original value of h plus one, h is decreased by half of its original value plus one, p is increased by i, f is equal to k minus g, y is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f, and the value of y is printed which is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and 2 times k minus 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n and k are integers, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than or equal to k or d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is less than or equal to -i+1, p is i, g is greater than or equal to (n+1)//2 + (h+1)//2 + (h+1)//2 + ... + (h+1)//2 (i-1 times), f is k minus g, y is 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f, and y is printed, where y is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f. If k <= (n + 1) // 2, then 2 times k minus 1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n and k are integers, s, i, d, h, p, g, f, and y are updated based on the condition k > (n + 1) // 2. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then n is greater than 0, k is at least 2, s is k, i is at least 2, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, f is k - n, y is 2, and 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and 2 * k - 1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
