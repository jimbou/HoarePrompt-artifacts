Output State: **n and k are integers, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0, f is k, y is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integer values input by the user. The values of `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` are reset to 0, and the value of `f` is updated to `k`. The value of `y` is updated to 1, which is 2 to the power of `i` (0) minus 1, times `f` (k).
