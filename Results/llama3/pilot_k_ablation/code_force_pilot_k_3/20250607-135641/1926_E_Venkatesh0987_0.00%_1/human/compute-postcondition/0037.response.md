The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is 3 and i is greater than or equal to 3. Since p is 3, it is less than or equal to i - 1 only if i is greater than or equal to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is greater than or equal to k or d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 4, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is less than or equal to 0, p is 3, g is greater than or equal to (n+1)//2 + (h+1)//2**
