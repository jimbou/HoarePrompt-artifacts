The code snippet assigns new values to the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g`. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line sets `s` to 0. The third line sets `i` to 0, effectively resetting the initial increment of `i` by 1. The fourth line sets `d` to the value of `n`. The fifth line sets `h` to the value of `n`. The sixth line sets `p` to 1. The seventh line sets `g` to 0.

Output State: **n and k are integers, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0**
