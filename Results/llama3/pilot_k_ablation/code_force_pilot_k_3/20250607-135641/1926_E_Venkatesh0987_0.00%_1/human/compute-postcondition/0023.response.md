Postcondition: ***n, k, s, i, d, h, p, g are integers. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is equal to k, d is equal to 0, i is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, g is increased by half of the original value of h plus one, h is decreased by half of its original value plus one, p is increased by i, f is equal to k minus g, y is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f, and the value of y is printed which is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and 2 times k minus 1 is printed.***
