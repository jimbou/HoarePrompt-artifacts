According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 2, `i` is greater than or equal to 2. `i` being greater than or equal to 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is greater than or equal to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is greater than or equal to k or d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 3, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is less than or equal to n, p is 2, g is greater than or equal to (n+1)//2**
