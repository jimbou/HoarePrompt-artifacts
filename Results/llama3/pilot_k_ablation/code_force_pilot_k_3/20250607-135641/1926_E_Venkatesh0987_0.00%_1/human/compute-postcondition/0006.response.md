Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer greater than half of the sum of n and 1, s is equal to (d + 1), d is equal to (d + 1) // 2, i is equal to 2, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: t - 1 pairs of integers.**

Explanation:
The first line increments `s` by `(d + 1) // 2`, effectively doubling its value. The second line decrements `d` by `(d + 1) // 2`, effectively halving its value. The third line increments `i` by 1, making it equal to 2. No other variables are affected.
