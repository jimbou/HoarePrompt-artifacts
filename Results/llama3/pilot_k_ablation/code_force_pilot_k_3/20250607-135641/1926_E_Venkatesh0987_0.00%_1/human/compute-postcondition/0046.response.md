Postcondition: ***n and k are integers, s is 0, i is 0, d is n, h is n, p is 1, g is 0. If k > (n + 1) // 2, then s is greater than or equal to k or d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is less than or equal to -i+1, p is i, g is greater than or equal to (n+1)//2 + (h+1)//2 + (h+1)//2 + ... + (h+1)//2 (i-1 times), f is k minus g, y is 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f, and y is printed, where y is equal to 2 to the power of i minus 1, times f. If k <= (n + 1) // 2, then 2 times k minus 1 is printed.***
