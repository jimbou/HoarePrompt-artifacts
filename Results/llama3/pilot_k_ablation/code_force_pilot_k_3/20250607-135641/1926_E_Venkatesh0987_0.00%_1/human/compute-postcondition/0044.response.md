Based on the precondition, we know that `k` is an integer and `k` is less than or equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The print statement is `print(2 * k - 1)`. This statement multiplies `k` by 2 and then subtracts 1.

Since `k` is an integer, the result of `2 * k - 1` will also be an integer.

Therefore, the print statement will print an odd integer that is one less than twice the value of `k`.

Output: **an odd integer that is one less than twice the value of k**
