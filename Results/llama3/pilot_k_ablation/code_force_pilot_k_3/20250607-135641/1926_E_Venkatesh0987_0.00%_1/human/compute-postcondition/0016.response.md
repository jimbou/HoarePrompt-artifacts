Output State: **s is equal to k, d is equal to 0, i is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, g is increased by half of the original value of h plus one, h is decreased by half of its original value plus one, p is increased by i.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values of s and d remain unchanged, the value of i remains the same as the number of iterations of the loop, the value of g is increased by half of the original value of h plus one for each iteration, the value of h is decreased by half of its original value plus one for each iteration, and the value of p is increased by the number of iterations of the loop.
