According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `p` and `i`. If `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `p` is 3, `i` is at least 3. `i` being at least 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 2, `s` is `k`, `i` is at least 4, `d` is 0, `h` is `(n+1)//4`, `p` is 3, `g` is `(3n+3)//4`, `f` is `k`, `y` is 1**
