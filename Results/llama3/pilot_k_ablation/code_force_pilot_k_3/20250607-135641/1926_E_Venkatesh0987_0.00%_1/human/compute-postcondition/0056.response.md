To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `p <= i - 1`. The variables involved in this condition are `p` and `i`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `k` is greater than 0
- `s` is `k`
- `i` is `k`
- `d` is 0
- `h` is `n`
- `p` is 1
- `g` is 0
- `f` is `k`
- `y` is 1

We focus on `p` and `i` since they are the variables in the loop condition. For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `p <= i - 1` must be true.

- `p` is 1
- `i` is `k`, and `k` is greater than 0

For `p <= i - 1` to be true, considering `p` is 1, `i - 1` must be at least 1. This means `i` must be at least 2. Since `i` is `k`, `k` must be at least 2 for the condition to hold.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure `k` (and thus `i`, since `i` is `k`) is at least 2. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is at least 2, `s` is `k`, `i` is `k`, `d` is 0, `h` is `n`, `p` is 1, `g` is 0, `f` is `k`, `y` is 1**
