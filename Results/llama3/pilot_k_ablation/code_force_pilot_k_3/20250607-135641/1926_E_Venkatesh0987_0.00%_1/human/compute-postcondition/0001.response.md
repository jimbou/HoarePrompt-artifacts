The code block reads an integer `t` and a pair of integers `n` and `k` from stdin, then initializes several variables. The first line assigns the values of `n` and `k` to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line initializes the variable `s` to 0. The third line initializes the variable `i` to 0. The fourth line assigns the value of `n` to the variable `d`. The fifth line assigns the value of `n` to the variable `h`. The sixth line initializes the variable `p` to 1. The seventh line initializes the variable `g` to 0.

After the code executes, the value of `t` is no longer in stdin, and `n` and `k` have been assigned the values of the first pair of integers from stdin. The variables `s`, `i`, `d`, `h`, `p`, and `g` have been initialized to their respective values.

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is 0, i is 0, d is equal to n, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers**
