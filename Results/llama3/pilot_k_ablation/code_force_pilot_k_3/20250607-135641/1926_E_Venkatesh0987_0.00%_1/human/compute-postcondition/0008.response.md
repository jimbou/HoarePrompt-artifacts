Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is greater than s, s is greater than or equal to its original value plus 1, d is less than or equal to its original value minus 1, i is 3, h is equal to n, p is 1, g is 0, stdin contains t - 1 inputs: t - 1 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has increased by at least 1, and the value of `d` has decreased by at least 1. The value of `i` has increased by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `h`, `p`, and `g` remain unchanged. The contents of stdin also remain unchanged.
