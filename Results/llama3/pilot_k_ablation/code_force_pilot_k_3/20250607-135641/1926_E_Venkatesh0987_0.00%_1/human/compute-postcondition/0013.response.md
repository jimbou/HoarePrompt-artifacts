Output State: **s is equal to k, d is equal to 0, i is equal to the number of iterations of the loop and must be at least 2, implying p must be less than i, g is increased by half of the original value of h plus one, h is decreased by half of its original value plus one, p is increased by 1**

In this output state, the values of s, d, and i remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of g is increased by half of the original value of h plus one, and the value of h is decreased by half of its original value plus one. The value of p is increased by 1.
