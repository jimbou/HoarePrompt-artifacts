The variables in the loop head are p and i, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables p and i. If p is less than or equal to i - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, p is 2, i is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, p must be less than or equal to i - 1, so i must be at least 3.

State: **n is greater than 0, k is at least 2, s is k, i is at least 3, d is 0, h is (n+1)//2, p is 2, g is (n+1)//2, f is k, y is 1**
