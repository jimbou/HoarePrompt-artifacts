Postcondition: **n and k are integers, s, i, d, h, p, g, f, and y are updated based on the condition k > (n + 1) // 2. If k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, then n is greater than 0, k is at least 2, s is k, i is at least 2, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, f is k - n, y is 2, and 2 is printed. Otherwise, k is less than or equal to (n + 1) // 2, and 2 * k - 1 is printed.**
