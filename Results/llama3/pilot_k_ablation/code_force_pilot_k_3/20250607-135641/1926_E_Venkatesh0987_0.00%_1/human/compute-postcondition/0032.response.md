Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, s is greater than or equal to k or d is 0, i is greater than or equal to 1, d is greater than or equal to 0, h is n, p is 1, g is 0**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is such that the loop has finished executing when either the sum `s` is greater than or equal to `k` or `d` is 0. The number of iterations `i` is greater than or equal to 1, and `d` is greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n`, `h`, `p`, and `g` remain unchanged.
