To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `p <= i - 1`.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is equal to `k`
- `d` is equal to `0`
- `i` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop

The loop condition involves `p` and `i`. Since `i` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, and we want the loop to execute at least once, we need to ensure that `p` is less than or equal to `i - 1`. This means `i` must be greater than `p` by at least 1 for the loop to execute.

However, the initial state does not provide information about `p`. Since `p` is not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot directly adjust its value. But we can infer that for the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 (since `i` is equal to the number of iterations), and `p` must be less than `i`.

Given that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, and `p` is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we focus on `i`. For the loop to certainly execute one time, `i` must be at least 1 (to satisfy `p <= i - 1` when `p` is 0 or any negative value). However, since `i` is equal to the number of iterations and we are considering the first iteration, `i` being at least 1 is a given. The critical adjustment is ensuring that `p` is less than `i`, but since we cannot directly adjust `p` based on the provided information, we acknowledge that `p` must be less than `i` for the loop to execute.

Thus, the adjusted state focuses on the implication for `i` and the relationship with `p`:

State: **`s` is equal to `k`, `d` is equal to `0`, `i` is equal to the number of iterations of the loop and must be at least 1, implying `p` must be less than `i`**
