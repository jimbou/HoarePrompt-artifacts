Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is at least 2, s is k, i is at least 2, d is 0, h is 0, p is i, g is n, f is k - n, y is 2 ** (i - 1) * (k - n)**

The code modifies the values of `f` and `y`. The first line assigns the value of `k - n` to `f`, which is the difference between `k` and `n`. The second line assigns the value of `2 ** (i - 1) * f` to `y`, which is the product of `2` raised to the power of `i - 1` and the new value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
