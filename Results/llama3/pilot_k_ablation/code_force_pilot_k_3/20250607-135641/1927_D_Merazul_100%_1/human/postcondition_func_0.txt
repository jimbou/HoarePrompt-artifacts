This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n, a list of n integers, an integer q, and q pairs of integers. It then processes each test case by iterating through the list of integers and maintaining a list 'a' that keeps track of the last index where the current integer was first seen. After processing the list, it reads q pairs of integers and for each pair, it prints either the value at the corresponding index in list 'a' along with the index if the value is greater than or equal to the first integer in the pair, or [-1, -1] if the value is less than the first integer in the pair. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.
