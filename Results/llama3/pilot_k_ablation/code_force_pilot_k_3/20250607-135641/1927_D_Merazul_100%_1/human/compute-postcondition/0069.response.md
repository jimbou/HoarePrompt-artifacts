Output: **t is 0, a is [0, j, j, ..., j] with t original value elements, p is the second last element in R, i is the original value of t, j is 1 if x is not equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is 0, x is the last element in R, q is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value minus 1, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t minus 2, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is greater than or equal to l, or [-1, -1] if a[r] is less than l**
