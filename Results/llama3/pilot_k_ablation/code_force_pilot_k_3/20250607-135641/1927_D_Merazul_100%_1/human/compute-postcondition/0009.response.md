Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains a series of test cases minus two test cases, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged, `stdin` still contains a series of test cases minus two test cases, the list `a` has been appended with the value of `j` (which is either its original value or 0) for each iteration of the loop, `p` now holds the last element of the input `R`, `i` is equal to the length of `R`, and `j` is either its original value or 0 if the last element of `R` is the same as the second last element, otherwise `j` is the index of the second last element in `R`. The input `R` must have at least one element, and `x` is the last element in `R`.
