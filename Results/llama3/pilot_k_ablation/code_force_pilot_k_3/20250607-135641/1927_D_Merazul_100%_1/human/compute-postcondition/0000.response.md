Output State: **t is an integer, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains an integer n, followed by a list of n integers, followed by an integer q, followed by q pairs of integers.**

The code defines a lambda function `R` that reads a line from stdin, splits it into space-separated integers, and returns them as a map object. The second line reads the first integer from stdin using the `R` function and assigns it to the variable `t`. This effectively removes the first test case from stdin. The remaining test cases in stdin are unchanged, each consisting of an integer `n`, followed by a list of `n` integers, followed by an integer `q`, and then `q` pairs of integers.
