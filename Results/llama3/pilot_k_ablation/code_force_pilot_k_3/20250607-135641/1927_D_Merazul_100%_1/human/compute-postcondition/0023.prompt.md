Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, `p` is the last element in R, `i` is the length of R, `j` is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, `R` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the last element in the R, `q` is the first element in R
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than or equal to 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R, q is truthy and equals to its original value minus 1, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than or equal to 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R, q is its original value minus 2 and q is greater or equal to 1, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than or equal to 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R, q is its original value minus 3 and q is greater or equal to 1, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
