The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater or equal to 1 and q is its original value minus 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of q needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and q currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R, q is its original value minus 2 and q is greater or equal to 2, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
