The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is a truthy value minus 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, q must be a truthy value minus 1 where the truthy value is greater than 1. So q must be greater than 0.
State: **t is 0, a is [0, j, j, ..., j] with t original value elements, p is the second last element in R, i is the original value of t, j is 1 if x is not equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is 0, x is the last element in R, q is greater than 0, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t minus 2, and this is printed: if a[r] is less than l, then a tuple containing a[r] and r is printed, otherwise a list containing -1 two times is printed**
