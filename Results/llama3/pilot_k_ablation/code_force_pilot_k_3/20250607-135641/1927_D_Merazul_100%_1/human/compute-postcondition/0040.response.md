To determine what will be printed, let's break down the given information and the print statement step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial State:**
   - `t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value.
   - `a` is a list where the first element is 0, and all other elements are `j`.
   - `p` is the last element in `R`.
   - `i` equals the length of `R`.
   - `j` is either its original value or equal to the length of `R` minus 1.
   - `x` is the last element in `R`.
   - `q` is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value.
   - `l` is the first element in `R`.
   - `r` is the last element in `R`.
   - `R` has at least as many elements as the original value of `t`.

2. **Analyzing the Print Statement:**
   - The print statement uses the syntax `print(*expression)`, which unpacks the elements of the expression and prints them as separate arguments.
   - The expression `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]` is a conditional expression that selects between two tuples based on the condition `a[r] < l`.
   - If `a[r] < l`, it selects the first tuple `(a[r], r)`.
   - If `a[r] >= l`, it selects the second tuple `[-1] * 2`, which is equivalent to `(-1, -1)`.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - Since `a` is a list where all elements except the first are `j`, and `r` is the index of the last element in `R`, `a[r]` will be `j`.
   - The condition `a[r] < l` depends on the values of `j` and `l`. However, without explicit values for `j` and `l`, we can't definitively say which tuple will be selected.
   - If `j < l`, the output will be `(j, r)`.
   - If `j >= l`, the output will be `(-1, -1)`.

Given the information and the structure of the print statement, the output depends on the comparison between `j` and `l`. However, since we can't compute the exact numerical values of `j` and `l` based on the provided information, we describe the output based on the condition.

Output: **(j, r) if j is less than l, otherwise (-1, -1)**
