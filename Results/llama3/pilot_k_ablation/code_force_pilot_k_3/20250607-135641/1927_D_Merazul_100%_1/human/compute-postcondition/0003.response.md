The only objects in the loop head are variables  x and R, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the R.  If the R has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains a series of test cases minus two test cases, a is [0], p is 0, i is 0, j is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the R must have at least 1 element and the x is the first element in the R.
State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains a series of test cases minus two test cases, a is [0], p is 0, i is 0, j is 0, R must have at least 1 element, x is the first element in the R**
