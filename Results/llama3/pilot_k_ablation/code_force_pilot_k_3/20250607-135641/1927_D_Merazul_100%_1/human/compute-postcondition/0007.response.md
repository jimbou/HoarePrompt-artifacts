The only object in the loop head is variable x and R, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the R.  If the R has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, R has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the R. So for the loop to be executed one more time the R must have at least 3 elements and the x is the third element in the R.
State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the second element in R, i is 2, j is either its original value or 0, R must have at least 3 elements, x is the third element in the R**
