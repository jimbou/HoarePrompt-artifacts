Output State: **t is 0, a is [0, j, j, ..., j] with t original value elements, p is the last element in R, i is the original value of t, j is 1 if x is not equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is 0, x is the last element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t minus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of t becomes 0, the list a contains t original value elements, all of which are j, the value of p becomes the last element in R, the value of i becomes the original value of t, the value of j becomes 1 if x is not equal to the second last element in R, otherwise it becomes 0, the value of x becomes the last element in R, the values of q, l, and r remain unchanged, and R has at least as many elements as the original value of t minus 1.
