Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j, j, j, ..., j], p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is: the value of t is 1 less than its original value, the list a contains the value j repeated a number of times equal to the length of R, p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, and R has at least as many elements as the original value of t.
