Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, `p` is the last element in R, `i` is the length of R, `j` is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, `R` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the last element in the R, `q` is the first element in R**

The value of `q` is assigned the first element of `R`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains a series of test cases minus two test cases.
