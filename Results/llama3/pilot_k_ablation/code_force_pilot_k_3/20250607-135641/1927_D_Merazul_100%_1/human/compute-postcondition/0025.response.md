Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0], p is 0, i is 0, j is 0, x is the last element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed.**

In this output state, the value of t is reduced by 1, and the values of a, p, i, and j are reset to 0. The values of x, q, l, and r remain unchanged. The print statement remains the same, depending on the value of a[r] and l.
