Output: **t is 0, a is [0, j, j, ..., j] with t original value elements, p is the second last element in R, i is the original value of t, j is 1 if x is not equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is 0, x is the last element in R, q is a truthy value minus 1, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t minus 2, and this is printed: if a[r] is less than l, then a tuple containing a[r] and r is printed, otherwise a list containing -1 two times is printed**
