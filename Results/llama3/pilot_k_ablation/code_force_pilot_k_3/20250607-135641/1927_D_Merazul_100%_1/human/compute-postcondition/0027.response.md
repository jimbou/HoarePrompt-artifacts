Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j], p is x, i is 1 greater than its original value, j is either its original value or i, x is the last element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, R must have at least 1 element.**

Here's a description of the final state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being greater than 0 and 1 less than its original value. The list `a` now has an additional element, which is the value of `j`. The value of `p` is updated to be the value of `x`. The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is either its original value or the value of `i`, depending on whether `x` is equal to `p`. The values of `x`, `q`, `l`, `r`, and `R` remain unchanged.
