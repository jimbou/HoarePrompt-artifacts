Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j, j, j, ..., j], p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is the first element in R, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t.
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j, j, j, ..., j], p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is truthy (not empty, not zero, not None) and is one less than its original value, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j, j, j, ..., j], p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is greater than 0 and is 2 less than its original value, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j, j, j, ..., j], p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus 2, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
