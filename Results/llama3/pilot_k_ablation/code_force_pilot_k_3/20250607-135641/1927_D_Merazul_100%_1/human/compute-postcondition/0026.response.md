To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `R`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `R`. If `R` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since `x` is the last element in `R`, we need to adjust the state of `R` to have at least 1 element.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, `a` is [0], `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `x` is the last element in the `R`, `q` is 0, `l` is the first element in `R`, `r` is the second element in `R`, `R` must have at least 1 element, and either (`a[r]`, `r`) is printed if `a[r]` is not less than `l`, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed.**
