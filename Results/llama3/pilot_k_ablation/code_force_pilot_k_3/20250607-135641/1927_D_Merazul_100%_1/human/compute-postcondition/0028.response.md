According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `R`. If `R` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `R` has at least 1 element, `x` is the last element in `R`, `l` is the first element in `R`, `r` is the second element in `R`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `R` must have at least 2 elements and `x` is the second element in `R`. 
State: **t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j], p is x, i is 1 greater than its original value, j is either its original value or i, x is the second element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the third element in R, R must have at least 2 elements.**
