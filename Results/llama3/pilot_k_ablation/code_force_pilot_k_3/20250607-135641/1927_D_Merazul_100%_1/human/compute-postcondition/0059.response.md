To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list containing `t` original value elements, which means `a` is a list with 0 elements, so `a` is an empty list `[]`.
   - `p` is the second last element in `R`.
   - `i` is the original value of `t`, which is 0.
   - `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the second last element in `R`, otherwise `j` is 0.
   - `x` is the last element in `R`.
   - `q` is a truthy value minus 1.
   - `l` is the first element in `R`.
   - `r` is the second element in `R`.
   - `R` has at least as many elements as the original value of `t` minus 2.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The expression `a[r]` tries to access the `r`-th element of list `a`. However, since `a` is an empty list `[]` and `r` is the second element in `R` (which is not specified but presumably an integer), this will result in an `IndexError` because there are no elements in `a` to access.

However, since the task is to determine what will be printed based on the given initial state and the Python code snippet, we'll proceed with the understanding that the code might not execute as expected due to the `IndexError`.

Given the initial state and the code snippet, the expression `a[r] < l` will not be evaluated due to the `IndexError` from trying to access `a[r]`. However, for the sake of understanding what the code intends to do, let's analyze the rest:

- If `a[r] < l` were true, it would print `a[r]` and `r`. However, since `a` is empty, this condition cannot be met.
- If `a[r] < l` were false, it would print `[-1] * 2`, which is `[-1, -1]`.

Since the code will actually result in an `IndexError` and not print any of the intended values due to the empty list `a`, the correct interpretation based on the task's requirements would focus on the error rather than the conditional outcomes.

**Output: An IndexError will occur because list 'a' is empty and there is no element at index 'r' to access.**
