Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0], p is 0, i is 0, j is 0, x is the last element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed.
Code of the loop:
for x in R():
    j = (j, i)[x != p]
    a += j,
    p = x
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j], p is x, i is 1 greater than its original value, j is either its original value or i, x is the last element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, R must have at least 1 element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j, j], p is x, i is 2 greater than its original value, j is either its original value or i, x is the second element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the third element in R, R must have at least 2 elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0 and is 1 less than its original value, a is [0, j, j, j], p is the third element in R, i is 3 greater than its original value, j is either its original value or 3 greater than its original value, x is the third element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the fourth element in R, R has at least 3 elements




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
