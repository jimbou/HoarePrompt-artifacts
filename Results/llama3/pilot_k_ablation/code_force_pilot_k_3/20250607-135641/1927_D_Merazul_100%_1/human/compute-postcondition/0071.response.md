Output State: **t is 0, a is [0, j, j, ..., j] with the original value of t elements, p is the last element in R, i is the original value of t, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is greater than or equal to l, or [-1, -1] if a[r] is less than l, for each iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the loop has finished executing, the value of t is 0, the list a contains the original value of t elements, all of which are equal to j, the value of p is the last element in R, the value of i is the original value of t, the value of j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, the value of x is the last element in R, the value of q is 0, the value of l is the first element in R, the value of r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t, and for each iteration of the loop, either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is greater than or equal to l, or [-1, -1] is printed if a[r] is less than l.
