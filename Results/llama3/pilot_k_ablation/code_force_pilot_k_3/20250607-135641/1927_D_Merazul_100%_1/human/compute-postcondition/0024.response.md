According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed.**
