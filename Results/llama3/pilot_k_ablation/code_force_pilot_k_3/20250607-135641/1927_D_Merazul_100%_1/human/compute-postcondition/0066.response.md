The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of q needed to have been equal or greater than 2 and q currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is 0, a is [0, j, j, ..., j] with t original value elements, p is the second last element in R, i is the original value of t, j is 1 if x is not equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is 0, x is the last element in R, q is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value and the original value of q is greater than 1, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t minus 2, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
