To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list with `t` original value elements, all of which are `j`. Since `t` is 0, `a` is an empty list.
   - `p` is the second last element in `R`.
   - `i` is the original value of `t`, which is 0.
   - `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the second last element in `R`, otherwise `j` is 0.
   - `x` is the last element in `R`.
   - `q` is a truthy value minus 1.
   - `l` is the first element in `R`.
   - `r` is the second element in `R`.
   - `R` has at least as many elements as the original value of `t` minus 2.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

Given the initial state, let's analyze the code:

- `a` is an empty list because `t` is 0. Therefore, `a[r]` will raise an `IndexError` because there are no elements in `a` to index.
- However, the logic of the code suggests that it's intended to compare the value of `a[r]` with `l` and then print accordingly. But since `a` is empty, this comparison cannot be made as intended.
- The expression `[-1] * 2` will always evaluate to `[-1, -1]`.
- The expression `(a[r], r)` cannot be evaluated due to the `IndexError` from trying to access an element in an empty list.

Given the precondition and the code, the execution will result in an `IndexError` because it attempts to access an element in an empty list (`a[r]`). However, the task asks for what will be printed, and based on the structure of the code, it seems there was an intention to print either `(a[r], r)` or `[-1, -1]` based on the comparison `a[r] < l`. Since `a[r]` cannot be evaluated due to the error, the comparison and the intended print logic cannot be executed as described.

Therefore, the precise description of what will be printed is not possible due to the error, but the intention seems to be to print one of the two tuples based on a comparison that cannot be made due to the initial state of `a` being an empty list.

Output: **An IndexError will occur due to attempting to access an element in an empty list (`a[r]`).**
