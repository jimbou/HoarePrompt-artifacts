According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, a is [0, j, j, j, ..., j], p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
