Output State: **`t` is 0, `a` is [0, j, j, ..., j] with `t` original value elements, `p` is the second last element in `R`, `i` is the original value of `t`, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the second last element in `R`, otherwise `j` is 0, `x` is the last element in `R`, `q` is the last element in `R`, `l` is the first element in `R`, `r` is the last element in `R`, `R` has at least as many elements as the original value of `t` minus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `q` has been updated to be the last element in `R`, and the value of `p` has been updated to be the second last element in `R`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `R` now has at least as many elements as the original value of `t` minus 2, since one element has been removed from `R` by the `R()` operation.
