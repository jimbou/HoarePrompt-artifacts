The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, t is an integer, So for the loop to  executed the first time t needed to have been greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains an integer n, followed by a list of n integers, followed by an integer q, followed by q pairs of integers.**
