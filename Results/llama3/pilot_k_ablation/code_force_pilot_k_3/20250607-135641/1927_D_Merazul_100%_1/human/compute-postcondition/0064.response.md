To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given initial state and the Python code snippet step by step.

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is 0.
   - `a` is a list containing `t` original value elements, which means `a` is initially an empty list because `t` is 0. However, it's described as `[0, j, j, ..., j]`, indicating it might be populated later with `j` values, but initially, it's empty or has a single element 0 based on the description.
   - `p` is the second last element in `R`.
   - `i` is the original value of `t`, which is 0.
   - `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the second last element in `R`, otherwise `j` is 0.
   - `x` is the last element in `R`.
   - `q` is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value.
   - `l` is the first element in `R`.
   - `r` is the second element in `R`.
   - `R` has at least as many elements as the original value of `t` minus 2, which means `R` has at least -2 elements, but since you can't have a negative number of elements, this description seems to be a bit off. It likely means `R` has at least 2 elements given the context of `p`, `x`, `l`, and `r`.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code `print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])` is using tuple unpacking and conditional expression.
   - `(a[r], r)` is a tuple containing the `r`-th element of `a` and `r` itself.
   - `[-1] * 2` creates a list with two `-1` elements.
   - The expression `[a[r] < l]` is a conditional expression that evaluates to an index. If `a[r]` is less than `l`, it returns the first element of the tuple `(a[r], r)`, otherwise it returns the list `[-1] * 2`.
   - However, given `t` is 0 and `a` is described as being initially empty or having a single element, accessing `a[r]` where `r` is the second element of `R` (and thus not necessarily 0) would result in an `IndexError` if `a` is indeed empty or only has one element.

Given the initial state and the code, there's a discrepancy in how `a` is described and how it's used. If we strictly follow the initial state, `a` is empty or has one element, making `a[r]` inaccessible without an `IndexError`. However, if we consider `a` might be populated with `j` values as hinted, the behavior would depend on the value of `j` and `l`.

**Assuming `a` is populated and accessible:**

- If `a[r]` is less than `l`, it prints the `r`-th element of `a` and `r` itself.
- Otherwise, it prints `-1` twice.

**Given the ambiguity and potential for an `IndexError`, the precise output cannot be determined without further clarification on the state of `a`.**

However, following the format strictly and considering the potential for `a` to be populated:

Output: **Either (a[r], r) if a[r] < l, or [-1, -1] if a[r] >= l, assuming a[r] is accessible.**
