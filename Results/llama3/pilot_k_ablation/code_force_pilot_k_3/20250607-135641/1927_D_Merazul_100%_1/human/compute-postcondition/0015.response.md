According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is truthy and equals to its original value minus 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time q needed to have been equal or greater than 2 and q currently must be truthy.
State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R, q must be truthy and equals to its original value minus 1 and q must be greater or equal to 2, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
