To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `R`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `R`. If `R` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `R` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the `R`, `p` is the first element in `R`, and `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute again, `R` must have at least one more element, and `x` must be the next element in `R`. Since `p` is the first element in `R` and `x` is also the first element in `R`, it means that `p` and `x` are the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `p` must be the second element in `R`.

State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains a series of test cases minus two test cases, a is [0, j], p is the second element in R, i is 1, j is either its original value or 0, R must have at least 2 elements, x is the second element in the R**
