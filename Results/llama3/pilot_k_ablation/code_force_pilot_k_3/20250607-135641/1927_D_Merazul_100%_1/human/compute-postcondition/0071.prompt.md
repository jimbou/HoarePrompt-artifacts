Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, stdin contains a series of test cases minus one test case. Each remaining test case contains an integer n, followed by a list of n integers, followed by an integer q, followed by q pairs of integers.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    R()
    a = [0]
    p = i = j = 0
    for x in R():
        j = (j, i)[x != p]
        a += j,
        p = x
        i += 1
    q, = R()
    while q:
        q -= 1
        l, r = R()
        print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than or equal to 0, a is [0, j] where j is either its original value or 0, p is the last element in R, i is the length of R, j is either its original value or 0 if the last element in R is equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is the second last index of R, R must have at least 1 element, x is the last element in the R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the second element in R, and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is 0, a is [0, j, j, j, ..., j], p is the last element in R, i is equal to the length of R, j is either its original value or equal to the length of R minus 1, x is the last element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l, for each iteration of the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is 0, a is [0, j, j, ..., j] with t original value elements, p is the second last element in R, i is the original value of t, j is 1 if x is not equal to the second last element in R, otherwise j is 0, x is the last element in R, q is 0, l is the first element in R, r is the last element in R, R has at least as many elements as the original value of t minus 2, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is greater than or equal to l, or [-1, -1] if a[r] is less than l, for each iteration of the loop.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
