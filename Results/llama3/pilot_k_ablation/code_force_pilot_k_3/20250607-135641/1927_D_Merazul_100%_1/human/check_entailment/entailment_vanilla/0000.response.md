Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t`.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and then the array `a` itself.

3. It initializes an array `a` with a dummy value at index 0, and variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to keep track of the previous element, the current index, and the index of the last different element, respectively.

4. It then iterates over the array `a`, updating `j` to be the current index `i` if the current element is different from the previous element `p`. It appends `j` to the array `a` and updates `p` to be the current element.

5. After processing the array, it reads the number of queries `q`.

6. For each query, it reads the left and right boundaries `l` and `r`. It then checks if the value at index `r` in the array `a` is less than `l`. If it is, it means that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`, so it prints `-1 -1`. Otherwise, it prints the value at index `r` in the array `a` and `r` itself.

The program's logic is correct. It correctly identifies the last different element for each prefix of the array and uses this information to answer the queries. The time complexity is O(n + q), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
