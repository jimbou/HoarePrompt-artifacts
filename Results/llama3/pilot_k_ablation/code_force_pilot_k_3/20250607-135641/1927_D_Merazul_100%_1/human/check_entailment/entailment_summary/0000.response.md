Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which includes the length of the array `n`, the array `a` itself, the number of queries `q`, and the `q` pairs of integers representing the queries.

2. The program then processes the array `a` and maintains a list `a` (note that the list `a` is different from the input array `a`) that keeps track of the last index where the current integer was first seen. This is done by iterating through the input array `a` and updating the list `a` accordingly.

3. After processing the array `a`, the program reads the `q` pairs of integers and for each pair, it checks if the value at the corresponding index in list `a` is greater than or equal to the first integer in the pair. If it is, the program prints the value at the corresponding index in list `a` along with the index. If it's not, the program prints [-1, -1].

4. The program correctly handles the case where the value at the corresponding index in list `a` is less than the first integer in the pair by printing [-1, -1].

5. The program continues this process until all test cases have been processed.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and its execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
