Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of an integer `n`, a list of `n` integers, an integer `q`, and `q` pairs of integers.

2. The program correctly initializes the list `a` with a single element `0`, and then iterates through the list of integers. For each integer, it updates the list `a` to keep track of the last index where the current integer was first seen.

3. After processing the list of integers, the program correctly reads `q` pairs of integers and for each pair, it prints either the value at the corresponding index in list `a` along with the index if the value is greater than or equal to the first integer in the pair, or `[-1, -1]` if the value is less than the first integer in the pair.

4. The program correctly handles the edge case where the value at the corresponding index in list `a` is less than the first integer in the pair, in which case it prints `[-1, -1]`.

5. The program correctly continues this process until all test cases have been processed.

Correctness: **True**
