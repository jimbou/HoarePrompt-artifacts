Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly identifies the pair of different elements within the given range for each query.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It first reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It then creates a new array `a` where each element `a[i]` is the index of the previous element that is different from `a[i]`. If no such element exists, `a[i]` is set to `0`.
4. It reads the number of queries `q` and for each query, it reads the range `[l, r]`.
5. For each query, it checks if `a[r]` is within the range `[l, r]`. If it is, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`. If not, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* When the range `[l, r]` contains only one element, in which case it prints `(-1, -1)`.
* When the range `[l, r]` contains multiple elements, but all of them are the same, in which case it prints `(-1, -1)`.
* When the range `[l, r]` contains multiple elements, and at least two of them are different, in which case it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
