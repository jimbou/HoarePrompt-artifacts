Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in an array `a` such that `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a clever approach to preprocess the array and store the indices of the first occurrence of a different element for each prefix of the array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array `a` itself.
3. It initializes an array `a` with a single element `0` and variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to keep track of the previous element, the current index, and the index of the first occurrence of a different element, respectively.
4. The program then iterates over the array `a` and updates the `j` index whenever it encounters a different element. The `a` array is updated with the `j` index at each position.
5. After preprocessing the array, the program reads the number of queries `q` and iterates over each query.
6. For each query, it reads the left and right boundaries `l` and `r` and checks if the `a[r]` index is greater than or equal to `l`. If it is, it prints the pair `(a[r], r)`. Otherwise, it prints `(-1, -1)`.

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem by preprocessing the array and using the stored indices to answer each query in constant time.

Correctness: **True**
