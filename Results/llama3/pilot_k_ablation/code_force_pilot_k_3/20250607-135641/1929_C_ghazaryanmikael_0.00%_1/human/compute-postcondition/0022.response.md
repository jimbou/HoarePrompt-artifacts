To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is used to iterate over the range of `int(input())`. The `input()` function is used to read the number of test cases.


At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. To execute the loop again, `_` should be incremented by 1, and `stdin` should contain multiple test cases minus four.


State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` plus `x` times the integer division of 0 by `k-1`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is `x`**
