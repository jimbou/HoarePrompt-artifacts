Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` plus `x` times the integer division of 0 by `k-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is `x`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `k`, `x`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged, `s` is updated to be `x` plus `x` times the integer division of 0 by `k-1`, and `i` is updated to be equal to `x`. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it was not affected by the loop.
