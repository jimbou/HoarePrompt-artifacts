The `print` statement is a conditional expression that checks whether the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`. If the condition is true, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

Based on the initial state, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `s` is also an integer between 1 and 10^9. The values of `a` and `s` are not explicitly provided, so we cannot determine the exact outcome of the comparison.

However, we can describe the output based on the condition. If `a` is indeed greater than or equal to `s`, the output will be 'YES'. Otherwise, the output will be 'NO'.

Output: **YES if a is greater than or equal to s, NO otherwise**
