Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is either 2 or 3, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**

The value of `s` is updated by adding the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its current value. Since `s` is initially either 1 or 2, and `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, the expression `s // (k - 1)` will be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the value of `s` will be either 2 or 3 after the update. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
