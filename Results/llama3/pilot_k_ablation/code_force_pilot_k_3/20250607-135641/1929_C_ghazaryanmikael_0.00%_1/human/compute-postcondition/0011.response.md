The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the number of test cases in `stdin`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases in `stdin`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1 and `stdin` must contain multiple test cases minus two.
State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is 0, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is `x`**
