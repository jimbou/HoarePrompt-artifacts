The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 1 plus the integer division of 0 by `k-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1**
