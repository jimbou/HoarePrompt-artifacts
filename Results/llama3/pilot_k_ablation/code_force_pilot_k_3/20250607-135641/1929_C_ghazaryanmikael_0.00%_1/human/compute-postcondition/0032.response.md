Output: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` plus the sum of `x-1` times the integer division of the sum of the integer division of `s` by `k-1` and 1 by `k-1`, `_` is 2, `i` is `x-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or not.**
