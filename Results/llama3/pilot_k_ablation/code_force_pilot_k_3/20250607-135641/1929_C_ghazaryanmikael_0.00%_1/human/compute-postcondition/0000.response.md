To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and the expression `int(input())`. The loop will execute if `int(input())` is at least 1.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three integers k, x and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9), _ is 0, int(input()) must be greater than 0**
