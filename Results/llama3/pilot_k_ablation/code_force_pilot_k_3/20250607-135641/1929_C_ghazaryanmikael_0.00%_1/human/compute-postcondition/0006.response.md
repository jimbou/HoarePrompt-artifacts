The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 1.
State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is either 2 or 3, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**
