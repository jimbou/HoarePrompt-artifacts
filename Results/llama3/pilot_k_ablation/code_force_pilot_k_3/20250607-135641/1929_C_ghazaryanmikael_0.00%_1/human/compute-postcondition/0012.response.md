The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `k`, `x`, and `a`. Since `k` was an integer between 2 and 30, `x` was 0, and `a` was an integer between 1 and 10^9, their values are updated to the input values. The second line assigns 0 to `s`, overwriting its previous value.

Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is 0, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, i is 0**
