Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is 4 plus twice the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the additional terms `s // (k - 1) + 1`, where `s` was initially 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
