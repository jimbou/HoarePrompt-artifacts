Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus twice the integer division of 0 by `k-1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1**

The code increments the value of `s` by the result of the expression `s // (k - 1) + 1`. Since `s` is initially 1 plus the integer division of 0 by `k-1`, the new value of `s` is 2 plus twice the integer division of 0 by `k-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
