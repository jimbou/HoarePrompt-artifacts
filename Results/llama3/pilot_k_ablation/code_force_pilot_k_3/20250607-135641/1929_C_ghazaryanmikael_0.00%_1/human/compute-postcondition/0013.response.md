According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0 and `x` must be greater than 0.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 0, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 0**
