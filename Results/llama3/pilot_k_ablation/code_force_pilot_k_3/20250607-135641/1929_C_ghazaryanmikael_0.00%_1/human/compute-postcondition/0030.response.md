Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` plus the sum of `x-1` times the integer division of the sum of the integer division of `s` by `k-1` and 1 by `k-1`, `_` is 2, `i` is `x-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `k`, `a`, and `_` as in the initial state. The value of `s` will be the sum of `x` and the sum of `x-1` times the integer division of the sum of the integer division of `s` by `k-1` and 1 by `k-1`. The value of `i` will be `x-1`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged.
