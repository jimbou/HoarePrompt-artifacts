Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` plus the sum of `x-1` times the integer division of the sum of the integer division of `s` by `k-1` and 1 by `k-1`, `_` is the number of test cases minus 1, `i` is `x-1`, `stdin` is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or not.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

*   The variables `k`, `x`, and `a` will still be integers, but their values will be the last values read from the input.
*   The variable `s` will hold the final sum calculated after all iterations of the inner loop.
*   The variable `_` will be equal to the number of test cases minus 1, indicating that the outer loop has finished executing.
*   The variable `i` will be equal to `x-1`, which is the last value it took in the inner loop.
*   The `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases have been processed.
*   Finally, either 'YES' or 'NO' will be printed, depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or not, indicating the result of the last test case.
