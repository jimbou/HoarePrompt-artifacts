Output State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is either 3 or 4 or 5, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated. Since `s` is either 2 or 3 and `k` is an integer between 2 and 30, the expression `s // (k - 1)` will be either 0 or 1. Therefore, `s` is incremented by 1 or 2, resulting in `s` being either 3, 4, or 5. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
