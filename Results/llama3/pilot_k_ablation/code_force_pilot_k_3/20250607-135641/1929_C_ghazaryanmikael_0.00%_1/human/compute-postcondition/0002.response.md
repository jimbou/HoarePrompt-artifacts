To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `x` is already defined as an integer between 1 and 100, we can conclude that `x` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, we can set `i` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 0**
