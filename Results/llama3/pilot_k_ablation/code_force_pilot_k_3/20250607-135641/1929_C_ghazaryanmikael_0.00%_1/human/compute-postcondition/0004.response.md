To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `x` is an integer between 1 and 100.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`k` is an integer between 2 and 30, `x` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `s` is either 1 or 2, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**
