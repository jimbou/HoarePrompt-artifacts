Reasoning:

The program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The outer loop iterates over each test case, and the inner loop calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee that he can win any number of coins.

The inner loop works by simulating the worst-case scenario, where Sasha loses x times in a row. In each iteration, it calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to recover from the previous loss. This is done by adding the minimum amount of coins needed to win the next bet, which is `s // (k - 1) + 1`, to the total amount of coins Sasha needs to have.

Finally, the program prints "YES" if Sasha's initial amount of coins is greater than or equal to the minimum amount of coins needed to guarantee a win, and "NO" otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
