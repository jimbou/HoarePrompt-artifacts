Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine whether Sasha can guarantee winning any number of coins in the casino game. The program iterates over the maximum number of consecutive losses (x) and calculates the minimum amount of coins required to guarantee a win. If the initial amount of coins (a) is greater than or equal to this minimum amount, the program prints "YES", indicating that Sasha can achieve his goal. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all potential cases. The calculation of the minimum amount of coins required to guarantee a win is accurate, and the comparison with the initial amount of coins is correct. The program also correctly handles the edge case where the initial amount of coins is 1, in which case Sasha cannot guarantee winning any number of coins.

I have thoroughly reviewed the program and could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
