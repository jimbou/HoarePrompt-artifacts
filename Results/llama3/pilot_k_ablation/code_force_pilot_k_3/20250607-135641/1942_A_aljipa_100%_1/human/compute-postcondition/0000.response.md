The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. Since the stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`, the value of `t` is now an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.**
