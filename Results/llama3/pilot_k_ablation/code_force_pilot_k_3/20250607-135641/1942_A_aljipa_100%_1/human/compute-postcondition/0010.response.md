Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of length n containing either all 1s, a range of integers from 1 to n, or all -1s, and stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k.**

The code first reads two integers n and k from stdin, which are used to determine the value of res. If k is equal to n, res is a list of n ones. If k is equal to 1, res is a list of integers from 1 to n. Otherwise, res is a list of n negative ones. The value of t is not affected by the code, and the value of _ is not used in the code. The stdin is left with t-4 lines, each containing two integers n and k.
