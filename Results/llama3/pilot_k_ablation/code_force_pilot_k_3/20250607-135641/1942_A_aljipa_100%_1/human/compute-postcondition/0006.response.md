Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, res is a list of length n containing either all 1s, a range of integers from 1 to n, or all -1s, and stdin contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers n and k.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 1 as it is not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input from stdin, which now contains `t-2` lines. The list `res` is updated based on the values of `n` and `k`, and its elements are being printed.
