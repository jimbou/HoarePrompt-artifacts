Based on the initial state, the print statement `print(*res)` will print the elements of the list `res`.

The list `res` has a length of `n` and contains either all 1s, a range of integers from 1 to `n`, or all -1s.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't determine the exact length of the list `res`. However, we can describe the possible values that will be printed.

Output: **Either all 1s, a sequence of integers from 1 to n, or all -1s, where n is the length of the list res**
