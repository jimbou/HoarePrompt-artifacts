Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

1. If k equals n, the program generates a list of all 1s, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the list are sorted.

2. If k equals 1, the program generates a list of integers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the list is sorted (the original list itself).

3. If k is neither 1 nor n, the program generates a list of all -1s, which indicates that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, and it correctly implements the logic to generate the desired output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
