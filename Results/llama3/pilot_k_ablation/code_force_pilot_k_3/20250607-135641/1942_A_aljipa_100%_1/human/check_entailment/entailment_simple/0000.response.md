Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program uses a simple approach based on the value of `k`.

If `k` is equal to `n`, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program creates an array of all 1s, which satisfies the condition.

If `k` is equal to 1, it means that only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program creates an array of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition.

If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, it means that there is no possible array that satisfies the condition, and the program outputs -1.

The program's approach is correct because it covers all possible cases for the value of `k`. The use of list comprehension and the ternary operator makes the code concise and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
