Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program takes two inputs, `n` and `k`, and outputs an array `a` that satisfies the conditions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `k` is equal to `n`, the program outputs an array of `n` ones. This is because an array of all ones has all its cyclic shifts sorted.

2. If `k` is equal to 1, the program outputs an array of numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because an array of consecutive numbers has only one sorted cyclic shift (the original array itself).

3. If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, the program outputs -1. This is because the problem statement guarantees that there is no array `a` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles the three possible cases for `k` and outputs the corresponding array `a` or -1.

Correctness: **True**
