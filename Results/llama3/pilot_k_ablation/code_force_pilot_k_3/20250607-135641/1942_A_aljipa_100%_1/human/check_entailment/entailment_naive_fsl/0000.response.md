Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when k is 2 and n is greater than 2. In this case, the program outputs [-1], but it should output a valid array a that satisfies the conditions.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program outputs [-1], but a valid array a is [1, 1, 2], which has 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 1, 2] and [1, 2, 1].

The program only handles the cases when k is equal to n or 1, but it does not handle the cases when k is between 1 and n. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
