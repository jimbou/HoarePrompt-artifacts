Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three possible cases for the value of k:

1. If k equals n, it generates a list of all 1s, which satisfies the condition that all cyclic shifts of the list are sorted.
2. If k equals 1, it generates a list of integers from 1 to n, which satisfies the condition that exactly one cyclic shift of the list is sorted (the original list itself).
3. If k is neither 1 nor n, it generates a list containing only -1, which indicates that there is no valid array a that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
