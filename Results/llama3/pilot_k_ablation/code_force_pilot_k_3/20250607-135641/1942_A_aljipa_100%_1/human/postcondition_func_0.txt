This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each case consists of two integers n and k. It then generates a list of length n based on the values of n and k: if k equals n, the list contains all 1s; if k equals 1, the list contains a range of integers from 1 to n; otherwise, the list contains all -1s. Finally, it prints the generated list for each test case.
