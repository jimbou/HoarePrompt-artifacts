Output State: **`n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr` plus 1, `i` is `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and `n` is not equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached the second last index of the list `s` (which is `n-2`), and the value of `ans` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the difference between consecutive elements in `s` was ever greater than 1 during the loop's execution. The other variables remain unchanged.
