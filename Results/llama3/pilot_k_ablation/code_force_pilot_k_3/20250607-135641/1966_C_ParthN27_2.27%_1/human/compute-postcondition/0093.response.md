Postcondition: **`n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr` plus 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and `n` is not equal to 2 and is greater than 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in the list `s` is less than or equal to 1 and `ans` is 0.**
