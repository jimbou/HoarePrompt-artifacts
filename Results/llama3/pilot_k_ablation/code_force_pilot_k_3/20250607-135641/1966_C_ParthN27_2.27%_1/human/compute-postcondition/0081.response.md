The code adds the third element of `arr` to the set `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` is 2, `arr[i]` refers to the third element of `arr`. The set `s` initially contains the first and second elements of `arr`, and now it also contains the third element.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first, second, and third elements of `arr`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case.**
