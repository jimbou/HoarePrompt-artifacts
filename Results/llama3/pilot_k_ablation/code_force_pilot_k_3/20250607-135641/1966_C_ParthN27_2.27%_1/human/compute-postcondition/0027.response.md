Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0, and `ans` is either 0 or 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.***
