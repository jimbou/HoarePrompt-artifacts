The value of `ans` is updated to 1 minus its current value. Since `ans` is either 0 or 1, its new value will be the opposite of its current value. Therefore, if `ans` was 0, it will become 1, and if it was 1, it will become 0.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0, and `ans` is either 1 or 0**
