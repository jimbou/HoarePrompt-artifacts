Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is still greater than 1.
