Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `_` is 0.***
