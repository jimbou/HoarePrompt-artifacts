Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 1. If the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` is greater than 1 or `n-1` is odd, then 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between any two consecutive elements in `s` is not greater than 1 and `n-1` is even, then 'Bob' is printed.***
