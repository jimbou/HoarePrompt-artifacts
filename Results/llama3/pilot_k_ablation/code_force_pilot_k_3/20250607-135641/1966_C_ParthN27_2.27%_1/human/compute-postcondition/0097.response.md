Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr` plus 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and `n` is not equal to 3 and is greater than 3. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in list `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is the opposite of its original value (i.e., if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 0).***
