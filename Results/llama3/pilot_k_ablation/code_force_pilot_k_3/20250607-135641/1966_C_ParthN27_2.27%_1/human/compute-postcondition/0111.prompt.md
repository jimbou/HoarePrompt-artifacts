Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2*10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), where a_i is the initial number of stones in the i-th pile. The number of test cases is given in the first line of the input (1 <= t <= 10^4).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    ans = 1
    s = [0] + s
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans = 1 - ans
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is the length of s, arr is a list of integers, s is a list containing all elements of arr plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, ans is either 0 or 1, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case, i is the index of the last element in s. If n is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If n is greater than 3, if ans is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. If ans is 0, 'Bob' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is the number of elements in the original set s plus 1, i is n-1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set s, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 2, if the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is greater than 1 or n-1 is odd, then 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is not greater than 1 and n-1 is even, then 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is the number of elements in the original list arr plus 1, i is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list arr, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is not 2, i is n - 1, and if ans is 1, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, 'Bob' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
