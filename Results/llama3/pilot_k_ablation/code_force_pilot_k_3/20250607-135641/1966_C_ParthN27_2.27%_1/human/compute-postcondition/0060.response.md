Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
