Output State: **`n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr` plus 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case.
