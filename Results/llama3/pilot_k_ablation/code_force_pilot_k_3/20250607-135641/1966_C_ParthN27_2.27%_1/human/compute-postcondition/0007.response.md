Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the first three elements of `arr`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the third element of `arr` (since `i` is 2), in addition to the first two elements it already contained. The other variables remain unchanged.
