Output State: **`n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr` plus 1, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, `n` is not equal to 4 and is greater than 4, `ans` is 1 minus its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the opposite of its previous value, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` still has at least 2 elements, and `s` still contains 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`. The value of `n` is still greater than 4 and not equal to 4, and the stdin still contains at least 1 test case.
