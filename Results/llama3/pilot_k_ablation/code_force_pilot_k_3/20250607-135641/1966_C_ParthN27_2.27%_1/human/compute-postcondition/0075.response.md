Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, i is n-1, ans is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case.**

The code block reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by 1. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `arr`, further reducing the number of test cases in stdin by 1. Finally, it initializes an empty set `s`. The values of `i`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged.
