The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases in stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 and stdin must contain at least 2 test cases.
State: **n is the number of elements in the original set s plus 1, i is n-1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set s, ans is 1, _ is 2, stdin contains at least 2 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is greater than or equal to 2, if the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is greater than 1 or n-1 is odd, then 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference between any two consecutive elements in s is not greater than 1 and n-1 is even, then 'Bob' is printed.**
