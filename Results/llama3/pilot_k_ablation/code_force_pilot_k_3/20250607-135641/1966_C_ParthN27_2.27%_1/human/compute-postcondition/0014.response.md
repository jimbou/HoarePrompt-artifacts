To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2 (since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`). Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 1, as it is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case**
