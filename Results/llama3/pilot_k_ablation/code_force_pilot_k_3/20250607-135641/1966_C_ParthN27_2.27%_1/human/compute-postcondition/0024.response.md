To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is already greater than 3, it remains the same.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 0, and `ans` is either 0 or 1**
