To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0**
