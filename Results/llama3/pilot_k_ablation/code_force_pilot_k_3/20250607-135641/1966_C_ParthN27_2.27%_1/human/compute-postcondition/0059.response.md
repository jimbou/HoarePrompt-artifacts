Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `_` is 1, and `ans` is 0 if the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 1.**

The code simply flips the value of `ans`, so if `ans` was 1, it becomes 0, and if `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
