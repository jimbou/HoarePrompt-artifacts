Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be one less than the initial value of `n`, and the set `s` will contain all elements from the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
