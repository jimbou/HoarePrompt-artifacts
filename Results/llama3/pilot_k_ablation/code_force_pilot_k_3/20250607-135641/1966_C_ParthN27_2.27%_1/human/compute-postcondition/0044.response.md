Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first, second and third elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case**

The value of `s` is updated by adding the third element of `arr` to the set, since `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
