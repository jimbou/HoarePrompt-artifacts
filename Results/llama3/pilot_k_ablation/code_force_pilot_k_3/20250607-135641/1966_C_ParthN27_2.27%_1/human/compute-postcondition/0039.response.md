To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is undefined before the loop, we can set it to 0, which is the starting value for the range function. The other variables (`arr`, `s`, `ans`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case**
