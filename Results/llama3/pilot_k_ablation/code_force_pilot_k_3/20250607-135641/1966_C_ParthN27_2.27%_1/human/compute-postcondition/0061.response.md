To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `_`, and `ans`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.**
