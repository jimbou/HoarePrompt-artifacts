To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `n` being an integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0 and `i` to be 0 (since it starts from 0 in the range).

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is an empty set, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `i` is 0**
