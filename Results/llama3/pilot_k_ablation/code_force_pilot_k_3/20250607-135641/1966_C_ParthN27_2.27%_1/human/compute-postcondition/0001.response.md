Output State: **n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, _ is 0, stdin contains at least 1 test case**

The code snippet reads an integer from the input and assigns it to `n`, then reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `arr`. The third line initializes an empty set `s`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that at least one test case has been consumed.
