The code `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` to the opposite of its current value. Since `ans` is either 0 or 1, the new value of `ans` will be the opposite of that, i.e., if `ans` was 0, it will become 1, and if `ans` was 1, it will become 0.

The other variables are not affected by this code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr` plus 1, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`, `ans` is the opposite of its original value (i.e., if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 0), `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and `n` is not equal to 3 and is greater than 3.**
