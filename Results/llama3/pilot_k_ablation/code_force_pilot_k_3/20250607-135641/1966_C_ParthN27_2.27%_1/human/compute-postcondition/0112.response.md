Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a number of piles and the initial number of stones in each pile. It then determines the winner of a game based on the number of piles and the differences in stone counts between consecutive piles. If there are only two piles, the function prints 'Alice'. If there are more than two piles, it checks the differences in stone counts between consecutive piles and prints 'Alice' if the last difference is greater than 1, otherwise it prints 'Bob'. The function processes all test cases and prints the winner for each case.**
