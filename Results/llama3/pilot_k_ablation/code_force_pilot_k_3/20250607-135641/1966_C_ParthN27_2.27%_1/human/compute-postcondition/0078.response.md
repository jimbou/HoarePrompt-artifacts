The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case.**
