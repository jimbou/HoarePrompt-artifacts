Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is still greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `i`, `arr`, `s`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged. The condition `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is still greater than 1. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case.
