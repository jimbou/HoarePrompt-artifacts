To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case**
