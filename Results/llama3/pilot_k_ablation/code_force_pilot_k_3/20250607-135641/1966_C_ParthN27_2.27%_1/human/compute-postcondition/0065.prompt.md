Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *n is the number of elements in the original set s plus 1, i is n-1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set s, ans is 1, _ is 1, stdin contains at least 1 test case, and n is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans = 1 - ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
