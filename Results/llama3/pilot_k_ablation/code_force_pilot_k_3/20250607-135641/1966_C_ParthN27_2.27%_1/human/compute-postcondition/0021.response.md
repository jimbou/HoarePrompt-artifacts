Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `ans` is 0, `_` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The initial state remains the same except that we are now outside the most internal loop or if statement.
