Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of the original set `s`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 1. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
