Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, and `_` is 0. If the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` remains 0. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.**
