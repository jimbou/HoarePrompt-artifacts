Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains all elements of `arr`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `i` is `n-1`**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all the elements from the list `arr`. The value of `n` will remain unchanged, as it is not modified within the loop. The variable `_` remains 0, and `stdin` still contains at least 1 test case, as these are not affected by the loop. The variable `i` will be one less than `n`, since it starts at 0 and increments up to but does not include `n`.
