Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all elements of `arr`, `ans` is 1, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same initial state, except that the variable `i` will be equal to `n` (the number of elements in the list `arr`), and the set `s` will contain all elements of the list `arr`. The other variables (`ans`, `_`, and stdin) remain unchanged.
