The code adds the element at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 1, it adds the second element of `arr` to `s`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first and second elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case**
