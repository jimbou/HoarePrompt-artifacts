The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of `arr` is added to `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` contains the first element of `arr`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `i` is 0**
