Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing all elements of `arr` plus an additional element 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `ans` is 1, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1, which is calculated by subtracting the initial value of `ans` (0) from 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
