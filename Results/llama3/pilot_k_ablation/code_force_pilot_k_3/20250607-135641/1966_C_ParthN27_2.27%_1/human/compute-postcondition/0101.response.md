Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of elements in the original list `arr` plus 1 and is greater than 4 and not equal to 4, `i` is 3, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is a list containing 0 and all elements of the original list `arr`, `_` is 2, stdin contains at least 1 test case. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 minus its previous value.***
