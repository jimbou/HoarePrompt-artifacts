Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The program works by generating a list of integers from 1 to n, alternating between even and odd numbers. This approach ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the list divide each other, thus satisfying the problem's condition.

The program correctly reads the number of test cases and the size of each list from standard input, generates the list of integers, and prints the list for each test case.

However, the program does not handle the case where n is less than 3. According to the problem statement, n is guaranteed to be between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive). Therefore, the program does not need to handle cases where n is less than 3.

In conclusion, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
