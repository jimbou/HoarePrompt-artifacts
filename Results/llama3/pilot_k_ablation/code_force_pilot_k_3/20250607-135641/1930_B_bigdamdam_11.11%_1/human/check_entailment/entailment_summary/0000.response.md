Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding a permutation of length n such that there do not exist two distinct indices i and j (1 ≤ i, j < n; i ≠ j) such that p_i divides p_j and p_{i+1} divides p_{j+1}.

The program works by generating a list of integers from 1 to n, alternating between even and odd numbers. This approach ensures that no two consecutive numbers in the list are divisible by each other, which satisfies the condition of the problem.

The program correctly handles the input and output formats, reading the number of test cases and the size of each list, and printing the generated list for each test case.

The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, generating the correct output for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the program's behavior, and the execution summary, it can be concluded that the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
