To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `a + 1` and `i` is incremented by 2 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, `a` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 4. Since `i` is now 4, `a` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`i` is 4, `a` is greater than or equal to 4, `p` is a list containing the integer 2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
