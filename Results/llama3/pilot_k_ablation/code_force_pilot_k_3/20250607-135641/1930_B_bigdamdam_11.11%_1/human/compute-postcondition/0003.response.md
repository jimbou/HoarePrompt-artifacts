Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is greater than or equal to 2, `p` is a list containing the integer 2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `a` is still greater than or equal to 2, as the code does not modify it. The list `p` now contains the integer 2, which was appended to it using the `+=` operator. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n within the range 3 to 10^5, as the code does not consume or modify the input.
