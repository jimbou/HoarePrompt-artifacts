Output State: **`i` is 4, `a` is greater than or equal to 4, `p` is a list containing the integers 2 and 4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains the same, which is 4. The value of `a` is still greater than or equal to 4. The list `p` now contains two integers: 2 and 4. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n, where n is between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive).
