To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the expression `int(input())`. For the loop to execute, `int(input())` must evaluate to a value that allows the loop to run at least once. Since `i` is used in the `range` function, it will start from 0 and go up to the value returned by `int(input()) - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5). `i` is 0, `int(input())` must return a value greater than 0**
