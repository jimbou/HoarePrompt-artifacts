Output: **The value of `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise it is `a-1` plus twice the integer division of `a-1` by 2, the value of `a` remains unchanged, still between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), the list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), the state of stdin remains unchanged, still containing t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5), and the list `p` containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive) is being printed**
