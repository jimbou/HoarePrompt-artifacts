Output State: **`i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1` + 4, `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and `i`, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is either `a` if `a` is even or `a-1` + 4 if `a` is odd, the list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and the value of `i`. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
