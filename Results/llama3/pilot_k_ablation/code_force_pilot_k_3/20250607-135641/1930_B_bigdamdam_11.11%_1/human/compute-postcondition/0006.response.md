The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `a` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 6, and `a` must be greater than or equal to 6.
State: **`i` is 6, `a` is greater than or equal to 6, `p` is a list containing the integers 2 and 4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
