Output: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `i` is `a-1` plus twice the integer division of `a-1` by 2, `p` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5), and the list `p` containing all integers from 1 to `a` is being printed**
