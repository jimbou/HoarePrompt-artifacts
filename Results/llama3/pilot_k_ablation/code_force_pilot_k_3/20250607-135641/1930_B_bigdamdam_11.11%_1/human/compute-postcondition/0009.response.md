The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If a is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `a` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is greater than or equal to 3 and i is now 1. 
State: **`i` is 1, `a` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is greater than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
