Output State: **`a` is an integer between 7 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 6, `p` is a list containing the elements 2, 4, and 6, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged, still being an integer between 7 and 10^5 (inclusive). The value of `i` also remains the same, which is 6. The list `p` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 6, in addition to its original elements 2 and 4. The stdin still contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n, with the range of n being between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive).
