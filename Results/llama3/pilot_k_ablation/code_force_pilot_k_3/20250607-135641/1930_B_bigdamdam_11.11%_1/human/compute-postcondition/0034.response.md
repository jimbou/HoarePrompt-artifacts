Output State: `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1` + 2 * ((a-1)//2), `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is as follows:

- The value of `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise it is `a-1` plus twice the integer division of `a-1` by 2.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged, still between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- The list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive).
- The state of stdin remains unchanged, still containing t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
