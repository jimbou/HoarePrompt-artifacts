The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 1, the list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and the number 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `a` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is greater than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and the number 1, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
