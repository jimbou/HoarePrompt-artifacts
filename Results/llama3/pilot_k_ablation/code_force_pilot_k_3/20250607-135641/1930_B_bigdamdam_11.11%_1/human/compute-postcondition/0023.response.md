Output State: **`i` is 4, `a` is a value between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing the integers 2 and 4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 4. The value of `a` is still between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), as it was not affected by the code. The list `p` now contains two integers: 2 (which was already present) and 4 (which was added by the code). The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n, where 3 <= n <= 10^5.
