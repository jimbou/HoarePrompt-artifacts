The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 2, the list `p` will now contain the single element 2. The values of `a` and the contents of stdin are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `p` is a list containing the single element 2, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
