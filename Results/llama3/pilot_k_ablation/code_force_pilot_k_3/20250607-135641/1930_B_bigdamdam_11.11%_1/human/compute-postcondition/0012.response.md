Output State: **`i` is 3, `a` is greater than or equal to 3, `a` is greater than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), the number 1 and the number 3, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains the same, which is 3. The value of `a` is still greater than or equal to 3, and it is also greater than or equal to itself, which is a trivial condition that does not provide any additional information. The list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), the number 1, and the number 3, which was appended to the list by the code. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
