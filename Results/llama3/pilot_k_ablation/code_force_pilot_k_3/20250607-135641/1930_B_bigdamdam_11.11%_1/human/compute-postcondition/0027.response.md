To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` is greater than 1.

State: **`i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1`, `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
