The code `p += [i]` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `p`. Since `i` is 6, the list `p` will now contain the integers 2, 4, and 6.

The values of `a` and the contents of stdin are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 6, `a` is a value between 6 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, and 6, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
