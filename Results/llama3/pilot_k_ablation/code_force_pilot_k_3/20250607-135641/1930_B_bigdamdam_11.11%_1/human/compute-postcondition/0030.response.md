Output State: **`i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1` + 2, `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and `i`, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains the same as in the initial state, which is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1` + 2. The value of `a` is still between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i`. The list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and `i`, as the code appends `i` to the list `p`. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
