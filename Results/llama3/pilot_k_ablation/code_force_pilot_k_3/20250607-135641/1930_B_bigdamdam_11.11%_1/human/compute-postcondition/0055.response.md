Output State: **`i` is `t`, `a` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin is empty, and the list `p` containing all integers from 1 to `a` is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `i` will be equal to the number of test cases `t`, the value of `a` will be the last input integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), the list `p` will contain all integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), the standard input `stdin` will be empty since all input lines have been processed, and the list `p` will be printed.
