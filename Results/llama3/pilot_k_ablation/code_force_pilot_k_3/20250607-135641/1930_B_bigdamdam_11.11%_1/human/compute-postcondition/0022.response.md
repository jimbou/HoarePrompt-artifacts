To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):`. This means that the loop will iterate over the range of numbers starting from 2, up to and including `a`, with a step size of 2.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 4.

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `a`. Since `a` is a value between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), we can conclude that `a` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, `p` and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is 4, `a` is a value between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing the integer 2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
