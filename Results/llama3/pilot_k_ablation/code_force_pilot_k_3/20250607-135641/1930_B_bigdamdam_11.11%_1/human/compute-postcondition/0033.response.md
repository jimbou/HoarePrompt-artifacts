Output State: `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1` + 2 * ((a-1)//2), `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise it is `a-1` plus twice the integer division of `a-1` by 2. This is because the loop increments `i` by 2 in each iteration, and the number of iterations is determined by the range of the loop, which is from 1 to `a` with a step of 2.
* The value of `a` remains the same as the initial value, which is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive).
* The list `p` contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive). This is because the loop appends the current value of `i` to the list `p` in each iteration, and the range of the loop covers all odd integers from 1 to `a`.
* The state of the stdin remains unchanged, containing t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
