Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases, and each subsequent integer represents the size of a list. For each list size, the function generates a list of integers from 1 to the list size, alternating between even and odd numbers, and prints the list. The function repeats this process for the specified number of test cases, until standard input is empty.**
