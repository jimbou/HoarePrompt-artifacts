Output State: **`i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1`, `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `a` if `a` is even, otherwise it will be `a-1`. The variable `a` remains unchanged, still within the range of 3 to 10^5 (inclusive). The list `p` will contain all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), in ascending order. The state of the stdin remains unchanged, containing t-1 lines of input, each with a single integer n within the range of 3 to 10^5 (inclusive).
