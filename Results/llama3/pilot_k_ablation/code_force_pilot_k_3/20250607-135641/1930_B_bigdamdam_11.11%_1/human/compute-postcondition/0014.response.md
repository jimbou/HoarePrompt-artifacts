Output State: **`i` is 5, `a` is greater than or equal to 5, `a` is greater than or equal to `a`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), the number 1, the number 3, and the number 5, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 5. The value of `a` is still greater than or equal to 5, and it is also greater than or equal to itself, which is a trivially true statement. The list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), as well as the numbers 1, 3, and 5, which was appended to the list using the `+=` operator. The state of the stdin remains the same, containing t-1 lines of input, each with a single integer n between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive).
