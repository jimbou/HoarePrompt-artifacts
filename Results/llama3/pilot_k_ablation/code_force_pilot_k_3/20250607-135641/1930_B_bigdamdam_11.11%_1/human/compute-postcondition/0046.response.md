To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and increments by 2). The value of `i` should be 1 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
