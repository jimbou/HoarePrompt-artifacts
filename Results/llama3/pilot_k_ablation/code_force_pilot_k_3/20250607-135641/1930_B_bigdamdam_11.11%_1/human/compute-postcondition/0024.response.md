The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `a` is a value between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2) and `a` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, `i` becomes 6 and `a` must be greater than 6.
State: **`i` is 6, `a` is a value between 6 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing the integers 2 and 4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
