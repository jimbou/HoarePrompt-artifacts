Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `i` is `a-1` plus twice the integer division of `a-1` by 2, `p` is a list containing all integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `a` remains unchanged, `i` is either `a` if it's even or a calculated value based on `a` if it's odd, and `p` now contains all integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), including both even and odd numbers. The stdin remains unchanged, containing t-3 lines of input, each with a single integer n between 3 and 10^5.
