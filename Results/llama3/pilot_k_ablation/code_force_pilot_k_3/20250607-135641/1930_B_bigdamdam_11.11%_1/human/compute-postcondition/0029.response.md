The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a` and `i` is an odd number, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1`, `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is increased by 2 and `a` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise `a-1` + 2, `a` is a value between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and `i`, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
