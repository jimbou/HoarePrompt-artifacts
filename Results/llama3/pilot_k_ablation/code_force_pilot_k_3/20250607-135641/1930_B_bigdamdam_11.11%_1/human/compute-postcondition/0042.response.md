The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. The initial state of `p` is a list containing the single element 2, and the value of `i` is 4. Therefore, the list `p` will now contain two elements: 2 and 4.

The values of `a` and the contents of stdin are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 5 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 4, `p` is a list containing the elements 2 and 4, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
