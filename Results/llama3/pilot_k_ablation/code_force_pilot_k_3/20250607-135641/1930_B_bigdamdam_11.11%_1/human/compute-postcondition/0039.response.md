To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` is at least 4 (since the range starts from 2 and increments by 2), and `i` should be 2 for the first iteration.

State: **`a` is an integer between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `p` is an empty list, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
