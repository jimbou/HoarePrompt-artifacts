The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 5, the list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), 1, 3, and 5.

The values of `a` and `i` are not changed by the code. The stdin still contains t-4 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).

Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 5, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), 1, 3, and 5, stdin contains t-4 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
