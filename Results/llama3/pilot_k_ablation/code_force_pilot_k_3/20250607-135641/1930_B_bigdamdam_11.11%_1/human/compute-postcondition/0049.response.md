Output State: **`a` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is 3, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive), 1 and 3, stdin contains t-3 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
