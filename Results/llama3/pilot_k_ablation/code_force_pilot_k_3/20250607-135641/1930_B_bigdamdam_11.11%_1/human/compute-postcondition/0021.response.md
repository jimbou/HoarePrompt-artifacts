Output State: **`i` is 2, `a` is a value between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` is a list containing the integer 2, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The value of `a` is still between 4 and 10^5 (inclusive), as it was not affected by the code. The list `p` now contains the integer 2, which was appended to it by the code. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each containing a single integer n, where n is between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive).
