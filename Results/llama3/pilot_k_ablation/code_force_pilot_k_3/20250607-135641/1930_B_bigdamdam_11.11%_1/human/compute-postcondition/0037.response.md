State: **`i` is `a` if `a` is even, otherwise it is `a-1` plus twice the integer division of `a-1` by 2, `a` is between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `p` contains all even integers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd integers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains t-2 lines of input, each containing a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5)**
