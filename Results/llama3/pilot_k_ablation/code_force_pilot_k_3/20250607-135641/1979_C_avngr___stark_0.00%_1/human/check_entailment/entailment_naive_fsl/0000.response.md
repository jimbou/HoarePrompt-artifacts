Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to distribute the coins in such a way that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is equal to the LCM.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, it prints the amounts of coins to bet on each outcome.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the case where the multipliers are all equal, and the case where the multipliers are all different. It also correctly handles the case where the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is equal to the LCM, in which case it prints -1.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
