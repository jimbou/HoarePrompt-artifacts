Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each outcome, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. The program then checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. If not, it prints -1.

The program uses a function `func_1` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of numbers. However, the implementation of this function is not provided in the given code snippet. Assuming that the function is correctly implemented, the program should work as expected.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. It calculates the LCM of the multipliers, calculates the bets for each outcome, and checks if the sum of the bets is less than the LCM. If the sum is less than the LCM, it prints the bets for each outcome. If not, it prints -1.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
