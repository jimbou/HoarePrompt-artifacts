Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine how to distribute coins among different outcomes such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The given program attempts to solve this problem by first calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers (k_i). It then calculates the amount of coins to bet on each outcome by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier. The program then finds the highest common factor (HCF) of these amounts and divides each amount by the HCF to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program then checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the amounts to bet on each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The reasoning behind this approach is correct. By minimizing the total amount of coins bet, the program ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function `func_1` is not necessary, as the `gcd` function from the `math` module can be used directly to find the HCF of the amounts.

Correctness: **True**
