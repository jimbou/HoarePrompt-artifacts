Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where you have to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program takes the number of test cases, the number of outcomes, and the multipliers for each outcome as input.

The program calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. It then calculates the bets for each outcome by dividing the LCM by the multiplier for that outcome. The program also calculates the highest common factor (HCF) of the bets and divides each bet by the HCF to minimize the total amount of coins bet.

The program checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. If it is, the program prints the bets for each outcome. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required.

The program uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the HCF of a list of numbers. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the HCF.

Based on the problem description and the execution states of the program, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the LCM and HCF of the multipliers and bets, and it checks if the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM. If the total amount of coins bet is less than the LCM, the program prints the bets for each outcome, which is the correct output.

Correctness: **True**
