Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is a list of integers representing a test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the test case**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the number of test cases (`numbers[0]`) and the test case (`num`). The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.
