Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is the last test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and all test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same structure as the initial state, but with the `hcf` variable updated to be the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and all test cases. The `numbers` list will remain unchanged, and the `num` variable will hold the last test case.
