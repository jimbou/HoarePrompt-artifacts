Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is a list of integers representing the next test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases, the next test case, and the previous value of `hcf`.**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases, the next test case, and the previous value of `hcf`. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged.
