Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is a list of integers representing the third test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases, the third test case, and the previous value of `hcf` and the new value of `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the previous value of `hcf` and `num`**.

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor of its previous value and `num`, which represents the third test case. The other variables, `numbers` and `num`, remain unchanged.
