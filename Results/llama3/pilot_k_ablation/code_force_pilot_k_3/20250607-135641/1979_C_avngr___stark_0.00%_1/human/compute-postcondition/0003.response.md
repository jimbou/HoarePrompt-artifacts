To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for num in numbers[1:]:`, which means we are iterating over the elements of the `numbers` list, starting from the second element (index 1).

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases. We also know that `num` is a list of integers representing a test case, and `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the test case.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when we move to the next element in the `numbers` list.

* `numbers` remains the same, as we are not modifying the list itself.
* `num` will be the next element in the `numbers` list, which is a new test case.
* `hcf` will be recalculated based on the new test case (`num`) and the number of test cases (which is the first element of the `numbers` list).

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is a list of integers representing the next test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the next test case**

Note that we don't need to specify the exact values of `num` and `hcf`, as they will be determined by the loop body. We only need to specify the relationships between the variables and the constraints on their values.
