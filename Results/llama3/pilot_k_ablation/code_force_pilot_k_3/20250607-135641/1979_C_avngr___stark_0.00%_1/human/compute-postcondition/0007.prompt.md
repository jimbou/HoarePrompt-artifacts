Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `numbers` is a list of integers, where the first element is the number of test cases, and each test case consists of a list of integers, where the first integer is the number of outcomes, and the remaining integers are the multipliers for each outcome; `hcf` is the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for num in numbers[1:]:
    hcf = gcd(hcf, num)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is a list of integers representing a test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases and the test case

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is a list of integers representing the next test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases, the next test case, and the previous value of `hcf`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, where the first element is the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are test cases, `num` is a list of integers representing the third test case, `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the number of test cases, the third test case, and the previous value of `hcf` and the new value of `hcf` is the greatest common divisor of the previous value of `hcf` and `num`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
