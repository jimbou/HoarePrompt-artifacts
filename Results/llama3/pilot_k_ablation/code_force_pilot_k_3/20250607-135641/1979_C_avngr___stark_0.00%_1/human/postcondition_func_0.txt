This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of test cases and all test cases in the input list 'numbers'. The input list is expected to have at least one element, where the first element represents the number of test cases, and the remaining elements are the test cases themselves. The function processes each test case to find the GCD, which is then returned as the result.
