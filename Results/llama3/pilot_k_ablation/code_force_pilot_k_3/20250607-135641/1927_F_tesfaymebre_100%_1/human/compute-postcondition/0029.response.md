Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains 0 edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing no elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1, and `node` is the node with the minimum edge weight.**

In this output state, the value of `node` is updated to be the node with the minimum edge weight, which is the same as `start` and `end`. The deque `que` is now empty since the only element, `start`, has been removed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
