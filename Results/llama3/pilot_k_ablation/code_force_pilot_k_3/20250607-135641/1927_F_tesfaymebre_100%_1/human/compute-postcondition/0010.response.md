Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m-1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1, w, u, and v are the values of the first tuple in the edges list, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` data structure to `parent_u` and `parent_v`, respectively. The values of `u` and `v` are obtained from the first tuple in the `edges` list, which is in descending order. The `dsu` data structure is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
