Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m-1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements. If the parent of u is equal to the parent of v in the dsu data structure, then _min_edge is the value of the first tuple in the edges list, start is the value of u from the first tuple in the edges list, and end is the value of v from the first tuple in the edges list. Otherwise, parent_u is now equal to parent_v because dsu.union(u, v) has been executed, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.***
