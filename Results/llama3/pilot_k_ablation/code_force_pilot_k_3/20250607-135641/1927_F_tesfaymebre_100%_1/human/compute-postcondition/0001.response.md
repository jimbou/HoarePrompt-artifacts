To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `test_cases`. The loop will execute if `test_cases` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `test_cases` to be greater than 0. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the execution of the loop, so we can ignore it.

State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0**
