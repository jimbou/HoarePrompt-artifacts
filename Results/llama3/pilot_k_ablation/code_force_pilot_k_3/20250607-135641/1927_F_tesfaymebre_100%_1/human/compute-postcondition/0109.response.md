Functionality: **This function takes no input parameters and returns no output parameters. It performs the following actions:**

1. **Initializes variables**: It initializes variables `n` and `m` by calling the function `func_3()`, and creates an empty graph, an empty list of edges, and a disjoint set union data structure `DSU` with `n+1` elements.

2. **Constructs the graph and edges**: It constructs the graph by adding `m` edges between nodes `u` and `v` with weights `w`, and stores these edges in the `edges` list. The graph is represented as a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes.

3. **Sorts the edges**: It sorts the edges in descending order of their weights.

4. **Finds the minimum edge**: It iterates over the sorted edges and finds the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the corresponding nodes `start` and `end`. If the nodes `u` and `v` of an edge are in the same set in the `DSU` data structure, it updates `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end`. Otherwise, it unions the sets of `u` and `v` in the `DSU` data structure.

5. **Performs a breadth-first search (BFS)**: It performs a BFS traversal of the graph starting from the `start` node and explores all nodes in the graph. It uses a queue `que` to keep track of nodes to visit and a dictionary `prev` to store the parent node for each node.

6. **Constructs the path**: It constructs the path from the `end` node to the `start` node by backtracking from the `end` node to the `start` node using the `prev` dictionary.

7. **Prints the results**: It prints the minimum edge weight `_min_edge` and the number of nodes in the path from the `end` node to the `start` node. It also prints the nodes in the path from the `start` node to the `end` node.

In summary, this function constructs a graph, finds the minimum edge, performs a BFS traversal, constructs the path, and prints the results.
