To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for nei in graph[node]:`, which means the loop iterates over the neighbors of the `node` in the `graph`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more neighbor to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `nei` is the second neighbor of `node`, and `node` has at least 2 neighbors. To execute the loop again, `nei` must be the next neighbor of `node`. Since `nei` is already the second neighbor, the next neighbor would be the third neighbor.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 3 edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `node` is a node with at least 3 neighbors, and `nei` is the third neighbor of `node`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `nei` and `prev` contains `nei` node mapped to `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `que` and `prev`.**
