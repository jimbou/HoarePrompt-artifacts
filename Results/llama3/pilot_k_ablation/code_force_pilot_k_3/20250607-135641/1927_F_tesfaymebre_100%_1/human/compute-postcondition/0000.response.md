Output State: **`test_cases` is the value returned by `func_1()`.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` has been updated to the value returned by the function `func_1()`. The previous value of `test_cases` as a positive integer is no longer valid, as it has been overwritten by the new value returned by `func_1()`. The output state only includes the updated value of `test_cases`, as the other variables and conditions in the initial state are not affected by the code.
