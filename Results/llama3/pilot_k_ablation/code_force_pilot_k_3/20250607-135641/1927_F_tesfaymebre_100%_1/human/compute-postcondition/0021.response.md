To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is: `for (w, u, v) in edges:`

The objects in the loop head are `w`, `u`, `v`, and `edges`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more tuples in the `edges` list. Since the list is in descending order, the next tuple will be the one with the next smallest weight `w`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `edges` has at least 0 tuples, and `i` is `m`, which means the loop has already processed `m` edges.

To execute the loop again, `edges` must have at least 1 more tuple. Let's assume the next tuple is `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`.

The states that need to be adjusted are:

* `edges`: must have at least 1 more tuple, specifically `(w_next, u_next, v_next)`
* `w`: will take the value of `w_next`
* `u`: will take the value of `u_next`
* `v`: will take the value of `v_next`

The other variables, such as `n`, `m`, `graph`, `DSU`, `dsu`, `parent_u`, `parent_v`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end`, are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `graph` contains `m` edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` in the `dsu` data structure, `_min_edge` is `w`, `start` is `u`, `end` is `v`**
