The code prints the elements of the `path` list in reverse order.
Since `path` is a list containing all nodes in the path from end to start, the print statement will output the nodes in the path in the reverse order, i.e., from start to end.
Output: **the nodes in the path from start to end (where the nodes are the elements of the path list in reverse order)**
