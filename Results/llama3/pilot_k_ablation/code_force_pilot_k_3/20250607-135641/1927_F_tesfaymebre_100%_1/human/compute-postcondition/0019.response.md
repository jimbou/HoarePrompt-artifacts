Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `graph` contains `m` edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` in the `dsu` data structure, and `u` and `v` are now in the same set in the `dsu` data structure.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the disjoint set union data structure `dsu` has been updated such that `u` and `v` are now in the same set. This means that `u` and `v` are now connected in the `dsu` data structure, and any future operations on `u` or `v` will be reflected in the same set.
