Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains 0 edges between nodes u and v, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is a deque containing the start node, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1.
Code of the loop:
while que:
    node = que.popleft()
    if node == end:
        break
    for nei in graph[node]:
        if node == start and nei == end:
            continue
        if nei not in prev:
            prev[nei] = node
            que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing all neighbors of `node` that are not `end` when `node` is `start`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is a node with all its neighbors explored.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing all neighbors of `node` that are not `end` when `node` is `start`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is the last neighbor of `start` in `que`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is an empty deque, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is `end`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
