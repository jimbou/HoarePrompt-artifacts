Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure**

The code snippet assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`, the value of `u` to `start`, and the value of `v` to `end`. No other variables are affected. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `DSU`, `i`, `dsu`, `parent_u`, and `parent_v` remain unchanged.
