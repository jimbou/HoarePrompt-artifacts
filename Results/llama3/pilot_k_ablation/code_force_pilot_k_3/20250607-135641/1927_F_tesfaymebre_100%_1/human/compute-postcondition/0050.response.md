Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing all neighbors of `node` that are not `end` when `node` is `start`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is a node with all its neighbors explored.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the loop has explored all neighbors of the current node, and the queue and previous node dictionary have been updated accordingly. The queue contains all neighbors of the node that are not the end node when the node is the start node, and the previous node dictionary maps each neighbor to the current node. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
