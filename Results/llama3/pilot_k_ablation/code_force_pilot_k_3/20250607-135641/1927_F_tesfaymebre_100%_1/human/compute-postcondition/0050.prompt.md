Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains 0 edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing no elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1, and if the current value of `node` is the same as `end`, which is the node with the minimum edge weight, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 1 edge connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing either no elements or `nei`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and either `nei` node mapped to `node` or no `nei` node, `node` is a node with at least 1 neighbor, and `nei` is the first neighbor of `node`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `nei` and `prev` contains `nei` node mapped to `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 2 edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `node` is a node with at least 2 neighbors, and `nei` is the second neighbor of `node`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `nei` and `prev` contains `nei` node mapped to `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `que` and `prev`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 3 edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `node` is a node with at least 3 neighbors, and `nei` is the third neighbor of `node`. If `node` is the same as `start` and `nei` is the same as `end`, then no changes are made to `que` and `prev`. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `nei` and `prev` contains `nei` node mapped to `node`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
