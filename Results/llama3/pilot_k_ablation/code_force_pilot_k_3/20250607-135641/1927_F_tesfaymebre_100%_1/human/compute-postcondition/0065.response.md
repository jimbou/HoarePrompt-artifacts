Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node and graph[node] has at least 2 neighbors, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is a deque containing at least one neighbor of node that is not end when node is start, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, all neighbors of node mapped to node, nei is mapped to node in prev, and node is the leftmost neighbor of start in que, nei is the second neighbor of node in graph[node].**

The code modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. This means that `nei` is now mapped to `node` in the `prev` dictionary. Additionally, the code appends `nei` to the `que` deque. This means that `nei` is now added to the end of the deque `que`. All other variables remain unchanged.
