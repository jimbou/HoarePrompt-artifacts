According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `graph` and `node`. If `graph` has at least 1 edge connected to `node` the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains 0 edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing no elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1, and if the current value of `node` is the same as `end`, which is the node with the minimum edge weight, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. So for the loop to be executed  the graph must have at least 1 edge connected to `node` and `nei` is the first neighbor of `node`.
