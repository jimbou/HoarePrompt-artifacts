To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `edges`, `w`, `u`, and `v`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` in descending order, and it must have at least 1 tuple. Since we've already processed the first tuple, we need to remove it from the list. So, `edges` will have at least 1 fewer tuple.
2. `i` is `m-1`, which means we've processed `m-1` edges so far. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented to `m`.
3. `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`. Since we've already processed the first tuple, we need to move to the next tuple in the list. So, `u`, `v`, and `w` will take the values of the next tuple in the list.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `graph` contains `m` edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is `m`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements. If the parent of `u` is equal to the parent of `v` in the `dsu` data structure, then `_min_edge` is the value of the first tuple in the `edges` list (if it exists), `start` is the value of `u` from the first tuple in the `edges` list (if it exists), and `end` is the value of `v` from the first tuple in the `edges` list (if it exists). Otherwise, `parent_u` is now equal to `parent_v` because `dsu.union(u, v)` has been executed, `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is -1, and `end` is -1.**
