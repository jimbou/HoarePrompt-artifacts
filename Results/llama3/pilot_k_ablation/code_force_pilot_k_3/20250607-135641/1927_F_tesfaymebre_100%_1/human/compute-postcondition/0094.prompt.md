Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing all neighbors of `node` that are not `end` when `node` is `start` and is not empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is the second last neighbor of `start` in `que`. If `node` is equal to `end`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Code of the loop:
for nei in graph[node]:
    if node == start and nei == end:
        continue
    if nei not in prev:
        prev[nei] = node
        que.append(nei)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node` and must have at least 1 neighbor of `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing all neighbors of `node` that are not `end` when `node` is `start` and is not empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1, all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `nei` is mapped to `node`. `node` is the second last neighbor of `start` in `que`, and `nei` is the first neighbor of `node`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node and must have at least 2 neighbors of node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is a deque containing all neighbors of node that are not end when node is start and is not empty, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, all neighbors of node mapped to node. If nei is not in prev, then nei is mapped to node. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to node and must have at least 3 neighbors of node, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing all neighbors of node that are not `end` when node is `start` and is not empty, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1, all neighbors of node mapped to node. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `nei` is mapped to node. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `nei` is the next neighbor of node in the graph. If `node` is `start` and `nei` is `end`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
