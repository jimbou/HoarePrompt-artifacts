Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `graph` contains `m` edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is `m-1`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `w`, `u`, and `v` are the values of the first tuple in the `edges` list, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure, `parent_v` is the parent of `v` in the `dsu` data structure, and `parent_u` is now equal to `parent_v` because `dsu.union(u, v)` has been executed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The disjoint set union data structure `dsu` has been updated by merging the sets containing `u` and `v`, making `parent_u` equal to `parent_v`. All other variables remain unchanged.
