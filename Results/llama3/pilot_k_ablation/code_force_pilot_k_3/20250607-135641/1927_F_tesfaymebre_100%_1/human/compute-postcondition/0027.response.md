Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains 0 edges between nodes u and v, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is a deque containing the start node, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1.**

In this output state, the code has introduced two new variables: `que` and `prev`. The `que` variable is a deque data structure containing the `start` node, which is the node with the minimum edge weight. The `prev` variable is a dictionary that maps the `start` node to -1, indicating that there is no previous node for the start node in the graph. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties.
