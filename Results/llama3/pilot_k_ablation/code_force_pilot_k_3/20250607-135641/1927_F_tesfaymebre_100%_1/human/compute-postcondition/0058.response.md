Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node` and `graph[node]` is not empty, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing at least one neighbor of `node` that is not `end` when `node` is `start`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, `node` is the leftmost neighbor of `start` in `que`, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`. If `node` is the same as `start` and `nei` is the same as `end`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
