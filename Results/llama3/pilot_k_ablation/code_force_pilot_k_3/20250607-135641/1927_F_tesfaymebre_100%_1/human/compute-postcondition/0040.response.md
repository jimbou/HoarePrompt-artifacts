To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.


The loop head is `for nei in graph[node]:`. The objects involved are `nei` and `graph[node]`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node`, and `graph[node]` contains at least 1 edge connected to `node`.


For the loop to execute again, `graph[node]` must contain at least 2 edges connected to `node`, and `nei` must be the second neighbor of `node`.


State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 2 edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing either no elements or `nei`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and either `nei` node mapped to `node` or no `nei` node, `node` is a node with at least 2 neighbors, and `nei` is the second neighbor of `node`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `nei` and `prev` contains `nei` node mapped to `node`.**
