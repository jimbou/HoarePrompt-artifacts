Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is not equal to -1, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of node mapped to node, node is end, path is a list containing end, the previous node in the path, and curr, and curr is the previous node in the path.**

In this final state, the code has appended the current node (curr) to the path list and updated the value of curr to be the previous node in the path, as indicated by the prev dictionary. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties.
