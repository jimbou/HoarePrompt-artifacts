Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 1 edge connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing no elements, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1, `node` is a node with at least 1 neighbor, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node`, and the current value of `node` is the same as `start` and the current value of `nei` is the same as `end`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to any variables. The `continue` statement simply skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without modifying any variables or data structures.
