Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is not equal to -1, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of node mapped to node, node is end, path is a list containing end and the previous node in the path, and curr is the previous node in the path.**

The code snippet modifies the `path` and `curr` variables. The first line appends the current value of `curr` to the `path` list. Since `curr` is initially equal to `end`, the `path` list now contains `end`. The second line updates the value of `curr` to the previous node in the path, which is stored in the `prev` dictionary. The `prev` dictionary maps each node to its previous node in the path, so `curr` is now set to the node that comes before `end` in the path.
