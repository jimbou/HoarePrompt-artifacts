You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, graph is a dictionary where each key is a node and its corresponding value is a list of its neighboring nodes, edges is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the weight of an edge and the two nodes it connects, and DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements.

    #State: Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is an empty deque, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is `end`.
    #
    #In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished exploring all nodes in the graph, and the `que` deque is empty. The `prev` dictionary contains the parent node for each node in the graph, and the `node` variable is set to the `end` node. All other variables remain unchanged.

    #This is printed: _min_edge (the minimum edge value in the path), len(path) (the number of nodes in the path from end to start)
    print(*path[::-1])
    #This is printed: the nodes in the path from start to end (where the nodes are the elements of the path list in reverse order)

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
