Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure. If parent_u is the same as parent_v, then the state of the variables remains the same. Otherwise, m is decreased by 1, graph contains m-1 edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m-1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where u and v are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v.**
