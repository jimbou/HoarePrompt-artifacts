Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 3 edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `node` is a node with at least 3 neighbors, and `nei` is the third neighbor of `node`. If `node` is the same as `start` and `nei` is the same as `end`, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `nei` and `prev` contains `nei` node mapped to `node`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `que` and `prev`.**
