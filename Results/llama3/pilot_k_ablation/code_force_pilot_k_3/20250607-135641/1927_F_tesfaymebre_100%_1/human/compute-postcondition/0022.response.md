Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure**

The code snippet modifies the values of `parent_u` and `parent_v` by assigning them the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` data structure, respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
