Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges contains m tuples (w, u, v) in descending order, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m-1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, end is -1
Code of the loop:
for w, u, v in edges:
    parent_u = dsu.find(u)
    parent_v = dsu.find(v)
    if parent_u == parent_v:
        _min_edge = w
        start = u
        end = v
    else:
        dsu.union(u, v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m-1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements. If the parent of u is equal to the parent of v in the dsu data structure, then _min_edge is the value of the first tuple in the edges list, start is the value of u from the first tuple in the edges list, and end is the value of v from the first tuple in the edges list. Otherwise, parent_u is now equal to parent_v because dsu.union(u, v) has been executed, _min_edge is positive infinity, start is -1, and end is -1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure. If parent_u is equal to parent_v, then _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v. Otherwise, u and v are now in the same set in the dsu data structure.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure. If parent_u is the same as parent_v, then the state of the variables remains the same. Otherwise, m is decreased by 1, graph contains m-1 edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m-1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where u and v are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
