To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition that allows the loop to execute. The loop condition is `while que:`, which means the loop will execute as long as the deque `que` is not empty.

Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `m` is 0
- `graph` contains 0 edges between nodes `u` and `v`
- `edges` is an empty list
- `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements
- `i` is -1
- `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`
- `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set
- `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`
- `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight
- `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight
- `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight
- `que` is a deque containing the `start` node
- `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1

The only variable in the loop head is `que`. For the loop to execute the first time, `que` must not be empty. According to the given state, `que` is already described as containing the `start` node, which means it is not empty. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains 0 edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing the `start` node, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1**
