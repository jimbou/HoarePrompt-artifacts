Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than or equal to 0, and the function `func_6()` has been executed `test_cases` times, and `_` is `test_cases - 1`.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `test_cases` remains unchanged, the function `func_6()` has been executed a number of times equal to the value of `test_cases`, and the variable `_` has been incremented to a value one less than `test_cases`.
