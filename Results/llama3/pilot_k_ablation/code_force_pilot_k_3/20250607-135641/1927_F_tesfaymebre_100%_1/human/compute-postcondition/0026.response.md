Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains 0 edges between nodes u and v, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the graph has been fully processed, and all nodes are now in the same set in the disjoint set union data structure. The minimum edge weight and the corresponding nodes have been found and stored in the variables _min_edge, start, and end. The loop has iterated over all edges in the graph, and the edges list is now empty. The variable i has reached -1, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
