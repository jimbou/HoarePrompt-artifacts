Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node and must have at least 2 neighbors of node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is a deque containing all neighbors of node that are not end when node is start and is not empty, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, all neighbors of node mapped to node. If nei is not in prev, then nei is mapped to node. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
