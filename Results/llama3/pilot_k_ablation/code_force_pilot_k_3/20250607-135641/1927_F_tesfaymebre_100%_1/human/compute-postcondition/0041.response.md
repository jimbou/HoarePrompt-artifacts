The code snippet is a continue statement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since there are no assignments or modifications to any variables, the state of the program remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains at least 2 edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing either no elements or `nei`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and either `nei` node mapped to `node` or no `nei` node, `node` is a node with at least 2 neighbors, and `nei` is the second neighbor of `node`. If `nei` is not in `prev`, then `que` contains `nei` and `prev` contains `nei` node mapped to `node`. We move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
