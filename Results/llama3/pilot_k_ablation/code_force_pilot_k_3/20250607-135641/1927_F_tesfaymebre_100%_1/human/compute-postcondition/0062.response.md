The only variable in the loop head is variable  nei, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `graph[node]`. If `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` is not empty, `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `graph[node]` must have at least 2 neighbors and the `nei` is the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node` and `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing at least one neighbor of `node` that is not `end` when `node` is `start`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1, all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and if `nei` is not in `prev`, then `nei` is mapped to `node` in `prev`, `node` is the leftmost neighbor of `start` in `que`, `nei` is the second neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]`.**
