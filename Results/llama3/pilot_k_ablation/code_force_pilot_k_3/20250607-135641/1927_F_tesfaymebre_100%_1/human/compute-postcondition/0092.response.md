Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node and must have at least 3 neighbors of node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is a deque containing all neighbors of node that are not end when node is start and is not empty, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, all neighbors of node mapped to node, and nei is mapped to node.**

The code modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new entry where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. Additionally, it appends `nei` to the `que` deque. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
