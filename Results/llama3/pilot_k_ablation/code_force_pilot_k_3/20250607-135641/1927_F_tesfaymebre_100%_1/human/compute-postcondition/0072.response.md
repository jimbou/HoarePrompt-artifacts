Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is a deque containing all neighbors of `node` that are not `end` when `node` is `start`, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is the last neighbor of `start` in `que`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates over all neighbors of the current node. If the current node is the start node and the neighbor is the end node, the loop skips this iteration. Otherwise, if the neighbor is not already in the `prev` dictionary, it is added to the dictionary with the current node as its value, and it is also added to the `que` deque. The loop continues until all neighbors of the current node have been processed.

After the loop finishes executing, the `que` deque contains all neighbors of the start node that are not the end node, and the `prev` dictionary maps each neighbor to the node that it was reached from. The `node` variable is set to the last neighbor of the start node in the `que` deque. All other variables remain unchanged.
