Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign the parent of `u` and `v` in the `dsu` data structure to `parent_u` and `parent_v`, respectively. The values of `u` and `v` are assigned by the `func_3()` function, which is not shown in the code snippet. The `dsu` data structure is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements. The `graph` contains `m` edges between nodes `u` and `v`, and `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples. The value of `i` is `m`. The values of `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` are not affected by the code snippet.
