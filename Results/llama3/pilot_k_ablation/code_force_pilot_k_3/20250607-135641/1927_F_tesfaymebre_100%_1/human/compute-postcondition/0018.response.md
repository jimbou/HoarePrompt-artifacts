Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is greater than or equal to 0, graph contains m edges between nodes u and v, edges is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is m, _min_edge is w, start is u, end is v, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure, parent_v is the parent of v in the dsu data structure.**

The code assigns the value of `w` to `_min_edge`, the value of `u` to `start`, and the value of `v` to `end`. No other variables are affected. The values of `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned by the `func_3()` function, but the code snippet does not provide information about this function, so their values remain unchanged. The rest of the variables retain their initial values.
