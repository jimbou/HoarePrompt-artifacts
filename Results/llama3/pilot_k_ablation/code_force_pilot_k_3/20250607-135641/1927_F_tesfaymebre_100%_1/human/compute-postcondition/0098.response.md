The only variable in the loop head is variable curr, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable curr. If curr is not equal to -1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, curr is end, so for the loop to execute the first time, end must not be equal to -1.

State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is not equal to -1, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of node mapped to node, node is end, path is an empty list, and curr is end**
