Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `graph` contains `m-1` edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is a list of tuples `(w, u, v)` in descending order that must have at least 0 tuples, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is `m-1`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where `u` and `v` are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is `w`, `start` is `u`, `end` is `v`.**

In this output state, the `dsu.union(u, v)` operation has merged the sets containing `u` and `v` into a single set, making `u` and `v` connected in the disjoint set union data structure. The values of `n`, `m`, `graph`, `edges`, `i`, `u`, `v`, `w`, `dsu`, `_min_edge`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged, except for the fact that `u` and `v` are now in the same set in the `dsu` data structure.
