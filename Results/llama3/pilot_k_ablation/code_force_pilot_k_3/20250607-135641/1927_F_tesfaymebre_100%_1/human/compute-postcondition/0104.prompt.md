Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of node mapped to node, node is end, path is an empty list, and curr is end.
Code of the loop:
while curr != -1:
    path.append(curr)
    curr = prev[curr]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is not equal to -1, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of node mapped to node, node is end, path is a list containing end and the previous node in the path, and curr is the previous node in the path.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is not equal to -1, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of node mapped to node, node is end, path is a list containing end, the previous node in the path, and curr, and curr is the previous node in the path.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
