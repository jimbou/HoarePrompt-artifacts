Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node and graph[node] is not empty, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is a deque containing at least one neighbor of node that is not end when node is start, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1, all neighbors of node mapped to node, and nei mapped to node, node is the leftmost neighbor of start in que, nei is the first neighbor of node in graph[node] and is in prev.**

The code modifies the `prev` dictionary by adding a new key-value pair where the key is `nei` and the value is `node`. This means that `nei` is now mapped to `node` in the `prev` dictionary. Additionally, the code appends `nei` to the `que` deque. Since `nei` is the first neighbor of `node` in `graph[node]` and is not in `prev` initially, this addition to `que` ensures that `nei` is now a part of the deque. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet.
