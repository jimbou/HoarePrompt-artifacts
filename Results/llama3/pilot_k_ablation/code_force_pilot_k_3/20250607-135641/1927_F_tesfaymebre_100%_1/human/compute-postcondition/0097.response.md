Output State: **n is a positive integer, m is 0, graph contains all edges connected to node, edges is an empty list, DSU is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements, i is -1, u, v, and w are assigned values returned by func_3(), dsu is a disjoint set union data structure with n+1 elements where all nodes are in the same set, parent_u is the parent of u in the dsu data structure which is the same as parent_v, _min_edge is the minimum edge weight, start is the node with the minimum edge weight, end is the node with the minimum edge weight, que is an empty deque, prev is a dictionary with start node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of node mapped to node, node is end, path is an empty list, and curr is end.**

The code initializes an empty list `path` and sets the variable `curr` to the value of `end`. The `path` list remains empty, and the `curr` variable is updated to the value of `end`. All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The loop has finished exploring all nodes in the graph, and the `que` deque is empty. The `prev` dictionary contains the parent node for each node in the graph, and the `node` variable is set to the `end` node.
