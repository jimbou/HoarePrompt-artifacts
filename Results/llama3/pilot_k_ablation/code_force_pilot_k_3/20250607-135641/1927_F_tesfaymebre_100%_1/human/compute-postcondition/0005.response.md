The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` is greater than 0, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, and the function `func_6()` has been executed again, `_` is 2**
