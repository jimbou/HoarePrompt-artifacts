Based on the precondition, we can determine the output as follows:

* `_min_edge` is not explicitly defined in the precondition, so we cannot determine its exact value. However, based on the context, it is likely that `_min_edge` is a variable that stores the minimum edge value in the path.
* `len(path)` is the length of the `path` list, which contains all nodes in the path from end to start.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `_min_edge` (which is unknown) and the length of the `path` list.

Output: **_min_edge (the minimum edge value in the path), len(path) (the number of nodes in the path from end to start)**
