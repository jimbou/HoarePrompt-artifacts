Output State: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 0, `graph` contains all edges connected to `node`, `edges` is an empty list, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is -1, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements where all nodes are in the same set, `parent_u` is the parent of `u` in the `dsu` data structure which is the same as `parent_v`, `_min_edge` is the minimum edge weight, `start` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `end` is the node with the minimum edge weight, `que` is an empty deque, `prev` is a dictionary with `start` node mapped to -1 and all neighbors of `node` mapped to `node`, and `node` is `end`.

The loop has finished executing all its iterations. The `que` deque is empty, indicating that all nodes have been explored. The `prev` dictionary contains the parent nodes for all neighbors of the `node` that was explored in the last iteration. The `node` variable is now set to `end`, indicating that the loop has reached the end node. All other variables remain unchanged.
