To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `edges`, `w`, `u`, and `v`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `edges` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. Since `i` is `m-1`, it implies that `m` is at least 1, and `edges` has at least 1 tuple.

For the loop to execute, `edges` must have at least 1 tuple, and `w`, `u`, and `v` must be the values of the first tuple in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `graph` contains `m` edges between nodes `u` and `v`, `edges` is a list of tuples (w, u, v) in descending order that must have at least 1 tuple, `DSU` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `i` is `m-1`, `u`, `v`, and `w` are assigned values returned by `func_3()`, `dsu` is a disjoint set union data structure with `n+1` elements, `_min_edge` is positive infinity, `start` is -1, `end` is -1, `w`, `u`, and `v` are the values of the first tuple in the `edges` list**
