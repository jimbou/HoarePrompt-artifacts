Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the case where both `a` and `b` are odd numbers. In this case, it's impossible to form another rectangle, so it prints 'NO'.
2.  The program also correctly handles the case where either `a` or `b` (or both) are even numbers. If `a` is equal to 2 times `b` and `b` is odd, or if `b` is equal to 2 times `a` and `a` is odd, then it's impossible to form another rectangle, so it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
3.  The program uses the correct logic to determine whether it's possible to form another rectangle. If `a` and `b` are both even, or if one is even and the other is odd, then it's always possible to form another rectangle by cutting the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearranging them.

Correctness: **True**
