Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is 3 3, the program will print 'NO', but according to the problem description, it should print 'YES' because the 3x3 rectangle can be cut into two 3x1 rectangles and then these two rectangles can be used to form the 1x6 rectangle, which is different from the 3x3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the rectangle can be cut into two equal rectangles, but it does not consider the case where the rectangle can be cut into two different rectangles that can be used to form a new rectangle.
