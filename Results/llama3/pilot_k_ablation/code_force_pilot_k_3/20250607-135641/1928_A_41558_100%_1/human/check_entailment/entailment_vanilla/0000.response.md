Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles and then rearranged to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of test cases (n) and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the dimensions of the rectangle (a and b).
3. It then checks if both a and b are odd numbers. If they are, it prints "NO" because it's impossible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
4. If a and b are not both odd, it checks if a is equal to 2 times b (or vice versa) and if b (or a) is an odd number. If this condition is met, it prints "NO" because the resulting smaller rectangles would have the same dimensions as the original rectangle.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints "YES" because it's possible to cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and rearrange them to form a new rectangle with different dimensions.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
