Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The program first checks if both the length and width of the rectangle are odd. If they are, it prints 'NO' because it's not possible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

Then, it checks if the length is twice the width or the width is twice the length, and if the width or length is odd, respectively. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO' because it's not possible to form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

If none of these conditions are true, it prints 'YES' because it's possible to cut the rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides and form another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

Correctness: **True**
