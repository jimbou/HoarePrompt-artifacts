Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to determine if a given rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and if these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

The program works by iterating over multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers `a` and `b` representing the size of the rectangle. It then checks the following conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides.
2. If either `a` is even or `b` is even (or both), it checks if `a` is equal to 2 times `b` and `b` is odd, or if `b` is equal to 2 times `a` and `a` is odd. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'NO' because the rectangle can only be cut into two identical rectangles.
3. If none of the above conditions are true, it prints 'YES' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides, and these two rectangles can be rearranged to form a new rectangle that is different from the original one.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately implements the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
