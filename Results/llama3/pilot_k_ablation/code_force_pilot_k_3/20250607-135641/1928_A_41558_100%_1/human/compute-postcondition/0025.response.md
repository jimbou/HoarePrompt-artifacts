The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then if `a` is equal to 2 times `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is equal to 2 times `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**
