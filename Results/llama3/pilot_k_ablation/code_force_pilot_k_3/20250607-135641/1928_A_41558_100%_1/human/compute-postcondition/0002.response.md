Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The code assigns the values of `a` and `b` to the integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `[int(i) for i in ...]` converts them to integers. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, since one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
