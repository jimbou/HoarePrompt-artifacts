Output State: **`n` is 0, `i` is `n`, `a` and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus `n` test cases. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then if `a` is equal to 2 times `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is equal to 2 times `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` will be 0, and the value of `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`. The values of `a` and `b` will be the last pair of integers read from the input. The number of test cases in the input will be reduced by the number of iterations of the loop. The loop will continue to print 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is even and the other is odd and their ratio is 2:1. Otherwise, it will print 'YES'.
