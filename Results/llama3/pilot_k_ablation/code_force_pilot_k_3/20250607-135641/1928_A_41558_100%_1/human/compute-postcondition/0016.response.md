Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers assigned from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then if `a` is equal to 2 times `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is equal to 2 times `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the integers assigned from the input, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one. The conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' remain the same as in the initial state.
