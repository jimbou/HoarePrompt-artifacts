Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers representing the size of a rectangle. It then checks each test case and prints 'YES' if the rectangle can be divided into 2x1 tiles without any leftovers, and 'NO' otherwise. The function continues this process until all test cases have been processed.**
