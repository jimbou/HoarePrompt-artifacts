Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case.**

In this output state, `n` is assigned the value of an integer between 1 and 10^9 from the input, where `input()` accepts an integer and `int()` converts it to an integer. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but since one test case has been read and assigned to `n`, there is one less test case remaining in the stdin.
