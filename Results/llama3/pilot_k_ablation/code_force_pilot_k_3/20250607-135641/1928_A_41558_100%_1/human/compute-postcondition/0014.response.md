Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. If both `a` and `b` are odd numbers, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even, then if `a` is equal to 2 times `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is equal to 2 times `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
