Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases. Either `a` is even or `b` is even or both are even. Additionally, it is not the case that `a` is equal to half of `b` and `b` is odd, and it is not the case that `b` is equal to half of `a` and `a` is odd***
