Output: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), _ is 1, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar is being printed, where the sum is calculated as the sum of (ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)**
