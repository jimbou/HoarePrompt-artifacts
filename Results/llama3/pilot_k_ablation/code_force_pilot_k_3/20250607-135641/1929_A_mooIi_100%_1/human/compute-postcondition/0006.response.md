The code prints the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`. The sum is calculated as the sum of `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` for `i` in range `1` to `n`, where `n` is the number of elements in the list `ar`. Since `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between `1` and `10^9` inclusive, the sum of the differences will be the sum of the differences between each pair of consecutive integers in the list.

Output: **the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
