The code prints the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`. The differences are calculated by subtracting each element from its previous element, starting from the second element (at index 1) up to the last element (at index `n-1`). The sum of these differences represents the total variation or spread of the numbers in the list.

Since `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the differences between consecutive elements will be non-negative integers. The sum of these differences will also be a non-negative integer.

Output: **the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
