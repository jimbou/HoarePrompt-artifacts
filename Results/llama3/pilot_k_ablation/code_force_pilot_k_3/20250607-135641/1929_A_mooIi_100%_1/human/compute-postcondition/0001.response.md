Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), _ is 0**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, which is the number of integers in the test case. The variable `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, which are the integers in the test case. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= n <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The value of `_` remains 0.
