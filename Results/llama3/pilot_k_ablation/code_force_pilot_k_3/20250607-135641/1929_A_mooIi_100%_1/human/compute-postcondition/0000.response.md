According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If the input is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and the `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `_` is 0**
