The code calculates the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar`. The differences are calculated by subtracting each element from its previous element (`ar[i] - ar[i - 1]`) for all elements except the first one (since there's no previous element for the first one). The sum of these differences is then printed.

Output: **the sum of differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar**
