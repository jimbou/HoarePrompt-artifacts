Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It sorts the integers in ascending order, calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, and prints this sum. The function processes multiple test cases, with the number of test cases specified by an initial integer t.**
