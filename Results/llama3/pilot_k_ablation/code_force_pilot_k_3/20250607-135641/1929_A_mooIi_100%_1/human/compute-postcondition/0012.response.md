Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, _ is t-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, and the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list ar is being printed, where the sum is calculated as the sum of (ar[i] - ar[i - 1]) for i in range(1, n)**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the loop variable `_` will have reached the value `t-1`, indicating that all `t` test cases have been processed. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, containing no more test cases. The variables `n` and `ar` will still hold the values of the last test case processed, with `n` being an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and `ar` being a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted list `ar` will be printed, calculated as the sum of `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` for `i` in range(1, `n`).
