Output State: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, ar is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, _ is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 100) followed by n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9)**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was already an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, its value is updated to the new input value, which is also between 2 and 100 inclusive. The second line assigns a sorted list of integers from the input to `ar`. Since `ar` was already a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, its value is updated to the new sorted list of integers, which is also between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 2. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 1, so it now contains `t-4` test cases.
