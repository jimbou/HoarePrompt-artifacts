The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the number of test cases `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and there are `t-2` test cases left in `stdin`. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, `ar` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 100) followed by `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `_` is 2**
