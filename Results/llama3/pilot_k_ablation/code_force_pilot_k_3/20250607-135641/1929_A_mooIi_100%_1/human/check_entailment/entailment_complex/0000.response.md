Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` from the input.
3. It sorts the array elements in ascending order using the `sorted` function and stores the sorted array in the variable `ar`.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension and the `sum` function. The list comprehension generates a list of differences `(ar[i] - ar[i - 1])` for `i` ranging from 1 to `n-1`.
5. It prints the calculated sum for each test case.

The program correctly implements the problem statement, which asks to find the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty is defined as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements. By sorting the array in ascending order, the program ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum beauty.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
