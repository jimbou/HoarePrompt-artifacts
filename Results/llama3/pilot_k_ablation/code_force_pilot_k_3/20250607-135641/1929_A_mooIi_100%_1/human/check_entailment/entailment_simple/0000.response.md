Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.

2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements themselves.

3. It sorts the array elements in ascending order using the `sorted` function. This is the key step in solving the problem, as it allows the program to calculate the maximum beauty of the array by summing the differences between consecutive elements.

4. The program calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array using a list comprehension. This is done by subtracting each element from its previous element (`ar[i] - ar[i - 1]`) and summing up the results.

5. Finally, the program prints the calculated sum, which represents the maximum beauty of the array.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the solution to the problem. The use of the `sorted` function to sort the array elements is particularly important, as it allows the program to calculate the maximum beauty of the array efficiently.

Correctness: **True**
