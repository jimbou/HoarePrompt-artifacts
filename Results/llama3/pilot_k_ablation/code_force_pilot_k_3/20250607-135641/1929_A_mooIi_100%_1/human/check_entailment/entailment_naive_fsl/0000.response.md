Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It sorts the input array in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

The program uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the input array, which is efficient and correct. It then uses a list comprehension to calculate the sum of the differences between consecutive elements, which is also efficient and correct.

The program handles all possible input cases correctly, including cases where the input array has duplicate elements or where the input array is already sorted. It also handles cases where the input array has a length of 2, in which case the maximum beauty is simply the difference between the two elements.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly implements the problem description.
