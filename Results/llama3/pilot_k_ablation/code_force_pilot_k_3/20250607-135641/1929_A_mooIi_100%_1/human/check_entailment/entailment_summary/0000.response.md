Reasoning:
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the length of the array `n` and the array elements `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`.
3. It sorts the array elements in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It calculates the sum of the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension and the `sum` function. This is equivalent to calculating the sum of `(a_i - a_{i-1})` for all integers `i` from 2 to `n`.
5. It prints the calculated sum, which represents the maximum beauty of the array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements.

The execution summary confirms that the program processes multiple test cases, sorts the array elements, calculates the sum of differences, and prints the result.

Correctness: **True**
