Reasoning:

1. The problem requires finding the maximum beauty of an array that can be obtained by rearranging its elements. The beauty of the array is calculated as the sum of the differences between consecutive elements.

2. The given program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array elements for each test case.

3. Inside the loop for each test case, the program sorts the array in ascending order using the `sorted()` function.

4. Then, it calculates the beauty of the array by summing up the differences between consecutive elements using a list comprehension. The differences are calculated as `ar[i] - ar[i - 1]` for each element `i` in the sorted array, starting from the second element (`i = 1`).

5. Finally, the program prints the calculated beauty for each test case.

6. The program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum beauty of the array by rearranging its elements. The sorting step ensures that the differences between consecutive elements are maximized, resulting in the maximum possible beauty.

7. The program handles the edge case where all elements in the array are the same, in which case the beauty is 0.

8. The program also handles the case where the array has only two elements, in which case the beauty is the difference between the two elements.

Correctness: **True**
