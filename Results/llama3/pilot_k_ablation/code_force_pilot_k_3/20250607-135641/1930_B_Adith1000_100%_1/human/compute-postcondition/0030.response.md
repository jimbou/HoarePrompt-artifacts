To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n // 2` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus four lines that were read by input() function, and the list `a` is not being printed**
