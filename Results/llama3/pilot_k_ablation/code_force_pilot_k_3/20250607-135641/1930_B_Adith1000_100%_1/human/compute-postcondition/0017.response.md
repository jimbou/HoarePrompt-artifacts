Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i + 1 is n - i and the value at index 2*i is i + 1, _ is 1, i is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function.**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified according to the given code. The value at index `2*i + 1` is now `n - i`, and the value at index `2*i` is now `i + 1`. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0. The variable `_` also remains unchanged at 1. The variable `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2. The state of stdin remains the same, with multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by the input() function.
