To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n // 2` is at least 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n // 2`, which should be adjusted to 0 for the loop to begin. The other variables and objects (`a`, `_`, and `stdin`) are not directly involved in the loop head and thus do not need adjustment for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `_` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function.**
