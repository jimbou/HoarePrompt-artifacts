To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Since `n` is already an integer greater than 0, we need to make sure that `n // 2` is at least 1, so the loop can execute at least once.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by `input()` function, `_` is 0, `i` is 0**
