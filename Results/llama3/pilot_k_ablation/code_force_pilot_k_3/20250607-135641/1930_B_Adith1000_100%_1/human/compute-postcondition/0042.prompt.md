Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), representing the number of test cases. Each of the following lines contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5), representing the length of the permutation p.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n // 2):
        a[2 * i + 1] = n - i
        a[2 * i] = i + 1
    if len(a) % 2 == 1:
        a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i. If the length of `a` is odd, the value at index n-1 is n//2 +1. `_` is 0, `i` is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by input() function, and the list `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i + 1 is n - i and the value at index 2*i is i + 1. If the length of `a` is odd, the value at index n - 1 is n // 2 + 1. `_` is 1, `i` is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function, and the list `a` is being printed. The list `a` contains elements in the following pattern: at index 2*i, the value is i + 1, and at index 2*i + 1, the value is n - i. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element (at index n - 1) is n // 2 + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with all odd-indexed elements replaced by `n - i` and all even-indexed elements replaced by `i + 1`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element of `a` is now `n // 2 + 1`. `_` is 2, `i` is `n // 2`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus four lines that were read by input() function, and the list `a` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
