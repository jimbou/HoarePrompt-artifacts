Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with all odd-indexed elements replaced by `n - i` and all even-indexed elements replaced by `i + 1`. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element of `a` is now `n // 2 + 1`. `_` is 2, `i` is `n // 2`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus four lines that were read by input() function, and the list `a` is printed**
