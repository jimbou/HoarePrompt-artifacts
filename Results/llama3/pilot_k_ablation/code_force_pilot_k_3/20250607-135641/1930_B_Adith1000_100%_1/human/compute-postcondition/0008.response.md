Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, _ is 0, i is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by input() function**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list 'a' will have its elements rearranged such that at even indices (0-based indexing), the value will be the index divided by 2 plus 1, and at odd indices, the value will be 'n' minus the index divided by 2. The variable 'i' will be equal to half of 'n' (integer division), and the other variables '_', and 'stdin' remain unchanged.
