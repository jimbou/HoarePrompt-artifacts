Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers from 1 to n with all odd-indexed elements replaced by n - i and all even-indexed elements replaced by i + 1, _ is 2, i is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus four lines that were read by input() function**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will have its odd-indexed elements replaced by the value of `n` minus the current iteration number `i`, and its even-indexed elements replaced by the current iteration number `i` plus 1. The variable `i` will have reached its final value, which is `n // 2`. The other variables, `_` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
