To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but we need to ensure that `n // 2` is greater than 2 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[2 * i + 1]` replaced by `n - i` and `a[2 * i]` replaced by `i + 1`, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus four lines that were read by `input()` function**
