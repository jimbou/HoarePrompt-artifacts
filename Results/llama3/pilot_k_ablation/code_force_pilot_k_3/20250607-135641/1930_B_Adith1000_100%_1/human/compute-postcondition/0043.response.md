Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n representing the length of a permutation. For each test case, it generates a permutation of the numbers from 1 to n, rearranging them in a specific pattern, and prints the resulting permutation. The pattern is such that the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i. If the length of the permutation is odd, the value at the last index is set to n//2 + 1. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding permutations.**
