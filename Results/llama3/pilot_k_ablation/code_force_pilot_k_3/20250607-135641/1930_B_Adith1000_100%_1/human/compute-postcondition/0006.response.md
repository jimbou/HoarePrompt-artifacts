To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, `n // 2` will be at least 1. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `_` and `a` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

The state of `stdin` is not directly related to the loop head, but since one line was read by the `input()` function, the state of `stdin` remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by input() function**
