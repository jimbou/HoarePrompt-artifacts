Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i. If the length of `a` is odd, the value at index n-1 is n//2 +1. `_` is t-1, `i` is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus t+1 lines that were read by input() function, and the list `a` is being printed**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `_` will be one less than the number of test cases `t`, and the value of `i` will be the integer division of `n` by 2. The list `a` will contain the elements in the pattern described, with the last element being `n // 2 + 1` if the length of `a` is odd. The stdin will contain multiple lines of input minus the number of lines read by the input() function, which is `t+1`. The list `a` will be printed.
