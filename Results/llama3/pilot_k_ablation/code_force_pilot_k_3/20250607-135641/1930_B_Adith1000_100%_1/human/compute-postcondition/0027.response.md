Output: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i + 1 is n - i and the value at index 2*i is i + 1. If the length of `a` is odd, the value at index n - 1 is n // 2 + 1. `_` is 1, `i` is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function, and the list `a` is being printed. The list `a` contains elements in the following pattern: at index 2*i, the value is i + 1, and at index 2*i + 1, the value is n - i. If the length of `a` is odd, the last element (at index n - 1) is n // 2 + 1.**
