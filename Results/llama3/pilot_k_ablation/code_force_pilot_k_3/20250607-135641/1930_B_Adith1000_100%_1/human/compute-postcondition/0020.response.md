The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i + 1 is n - i and the value at index 2*i is i + 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function.**
