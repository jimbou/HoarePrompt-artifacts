Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with all odd-indexed elements replaced by `n - i` and all even-indexed elements replaced by `i + 1`, except for the last element which is now `n // 2 + 1`, `_` is 2, `i` is `n // 2`, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus four lines that were read by input() function.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The list `a` has been modified such that the last element is now `n // 2 + 1`, while the rest of the elements remain the same, following the pattern of odd-indexed elements being `n - i` and even-indexed elements being `i + 1`. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus four lines that were previously read.
