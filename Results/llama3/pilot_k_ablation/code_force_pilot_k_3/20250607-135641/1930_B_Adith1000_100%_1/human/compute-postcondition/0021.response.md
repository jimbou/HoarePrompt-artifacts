Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i + 1 is n - i and the value at index 2*i is i + 1, _ is 1, i is 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that modify the list `a` at specific indices. The first line assigns the value of `n - i` to the index `2 * i + 1` in list `a`. Since `i` is 2, this index is `2 * 2 + 1 = 5`. The value of `n - i` is `n - 2`, which is assigned to `a[5]`.

The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to the index `2 * i` in list `a`. Since `i` is 2, this index is `2 * 2 = 4`. The value of `i + 1` is `2 + 1 = 3`, which is assigned to `a[4]`.

The rest of the variables, including `n`, `_`, and `i`, remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations are performed in the given code snippet.

Therefore, the final output state is the same as the initial state, with the modifications to list `a` at indices 4 and 5.
