To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`, which means the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:

* `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
* `a` is a list of integers with specific values at certain indices
* `_` is 1 (this variable is not relevant to the loop)
* `i` is 0
* `stdin` contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by the `input()` function (this is not relevant to the loop)

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is currently 0, and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`, we need to increment `i` by 1 to make the loop execute again. Therefore, `i` should become 1.

The value of `n` does not need to change, as it is not modified by the loop. However, we need to ensure that `n` is still greater than or equal to 2, so that the loop can execute again.

The state of `a`, `_`, and `stdin` does not need to be adjusted, as they are not relevant to the loop condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i + 1 is n - i and the value at index 2*i is i + 1, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function.**
