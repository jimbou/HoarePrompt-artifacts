Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i except at index n-1 which is n//2 +1, `_` is 0, `i` is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by input() function. The current value of the length of a is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0. The list `a` still has the same pattern of values at even and odd indices, but the value at the last index (`n-1`) has been updated to `n//2 + 1`. The values of `_` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, minus one line that was read by the `input()` function. The length of list `a` is still odd.
