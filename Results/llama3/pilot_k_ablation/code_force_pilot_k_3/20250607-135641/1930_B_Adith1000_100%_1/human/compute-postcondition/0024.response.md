Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i + 1 is n - i and the value at index 2*i is i + 1, except at index n - 1 which is n // 2 + 1, `_` is 1, `i` is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus three lines that were read by input() function. The current value of the length of a is an odd number.**

In this output state, the value of `a` at index `n - 1` has been updated to `n // 2 + 1`, while the rest of the list remains the same. The other variables, including `n`, `_`, and `i`, retain their original values. The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, minus the three lines that were read by the `input()` function. The length of list `a` is still an odd number.
