The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and the input() function, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input() function. If the input() function returns a value that can be converted to an integer and that integer is greater than 0, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), representing the number of test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input() function must return a value that can be converted to an integer and that integer is greater than 0 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3), representing the number of test cases, _ is 0, input() function must return a value that can be converted to an integer and that integer is greater than 0**
