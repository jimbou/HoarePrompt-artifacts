Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i. If the length of `a` is odd, the value at index n-1 is n//2 +1. `_` is 0, `i` is n // 2, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by input() function.***
