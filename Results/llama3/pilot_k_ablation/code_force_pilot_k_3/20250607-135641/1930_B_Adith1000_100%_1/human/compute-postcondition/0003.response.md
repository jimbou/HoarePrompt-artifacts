Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, _ is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by input() function**

In this output state, the list `a` has been modified such that the value at even indices (2*i) is i+1 and the value at odd indices (2*i+1) is n-i. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The variable `_` remains 0 and `i` remains 0 as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged as no input operation is performed in the given code snippet.
