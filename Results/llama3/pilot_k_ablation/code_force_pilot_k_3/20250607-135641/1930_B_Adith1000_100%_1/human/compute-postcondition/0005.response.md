Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i is i+1 and the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, _ is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by input() function**

The code snippet consists of two lines that modify the list `a` at specific indices. The first line assigns the value of `n - i` to the element at index `2 * i + 1`, and the second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to the element at index `2 * i`. 

Since `i` is 1, the first line assigns the value of `n - 1` to the element at index 3, and the second line assigns the value of 2 to the element at index 2. 

The rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `_` is still 0, and `i` is still 1. Stdin still contains multiple lines of input minus one line that was read by the `input()` function.
