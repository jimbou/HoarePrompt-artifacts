According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `reachable_count`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `reachable_count` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n` and less than its original value by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0 and `reachable_count` must be less than or equal to `k + 1`. Since `reachable_count` is less than its original value by 1, its original value must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`qs` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `reachable_count` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n` and less than its original value by 1, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1, `reachable_count` must be less than or equal to `k + 1` and `reachable_count`'s original value must be greater than or equal to 2**
