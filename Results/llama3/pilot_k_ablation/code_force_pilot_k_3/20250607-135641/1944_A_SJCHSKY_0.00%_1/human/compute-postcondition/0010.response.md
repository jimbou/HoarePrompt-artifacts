The code prints the value of `reachable_count`, which is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, `reachable_count` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Output: **a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive)**
