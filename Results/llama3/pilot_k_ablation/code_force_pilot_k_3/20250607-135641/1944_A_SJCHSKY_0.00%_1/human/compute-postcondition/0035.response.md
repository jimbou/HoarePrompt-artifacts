Functionality: **The function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. It then calculates the maximum reachable count for each test case by iteratively subtracting the current reachable count minus one from k until k is less than the reachable count minus one. The function prints the final reachable count for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.**
