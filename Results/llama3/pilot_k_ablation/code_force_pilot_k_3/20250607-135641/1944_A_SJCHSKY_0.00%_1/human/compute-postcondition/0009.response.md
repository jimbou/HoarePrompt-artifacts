Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is 0, reachable_count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to n, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that qs remains a positive integer greater than 0, n remains a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k becomes 0, reachable_count becomes greater than 0 and less than or equal to n, _ remains 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.
