The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `qs`. If `qs` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `qs` is a positive integer and stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2. So for the loop to be executed, `qs` must be greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`qs` is a positive integer greater than 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: two integers n and k, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100 and k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2, _ is 0**
