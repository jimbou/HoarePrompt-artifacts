Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a non-negative integer, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k + 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has finished executing, the values of `qs`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is now a non-negative integer, and the value of `reachable_count` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n` and less than or equal to `k + 1`. The loop has terminated when `k` is less than `reachable_count - 1` or `k` is 0.
