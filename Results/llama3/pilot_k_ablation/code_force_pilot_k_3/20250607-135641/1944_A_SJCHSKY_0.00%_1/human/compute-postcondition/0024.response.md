Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a non-negative integer, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k + 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `qs`, `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the values provided in the input. The value of `reachable_count` is updated to be equal to the new value of `n`. Stdin now contains one less test case.
