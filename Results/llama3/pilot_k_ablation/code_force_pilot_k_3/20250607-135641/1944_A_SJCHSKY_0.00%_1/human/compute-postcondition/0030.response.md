Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus reachable_count plus 1 and k is greater than or equal to reachable_count - 1, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k - 1 and is equal to its original value minus 1 and reachable_count is greater than 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `reachable_count`. The first line decrements `k` by `reachable_count - 1`, and the second line decrements `reachable_count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
