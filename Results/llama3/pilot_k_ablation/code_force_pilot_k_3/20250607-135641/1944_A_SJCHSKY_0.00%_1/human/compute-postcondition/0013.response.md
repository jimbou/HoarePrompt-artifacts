Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a positive integer, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the values of `qs`, `_` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to a positive integer less than or equal to 100, and the value of `k` is updated to a positive integer. The value of `reachable_count` is set to `n`, which is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`. Stdin contains one less test case as one test case has been read and processed.
