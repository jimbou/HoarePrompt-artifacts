Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n*(n-1)/2, reachable_count is equal to n, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

The code first reads two integers, `n` and `k`, from the input and assigns them to the corresponding variables. The value of `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, and the value of `k` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n*(n-1)/2`. The second line assigns the value of `n` to `reachable_count`. The variable `_` remains unchanged with a value of 0. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1.
