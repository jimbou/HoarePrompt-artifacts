Output State: **qs is 0, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a non-negative integer, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k + 1, _ is qs, stdin contains no test cases, and the value of reachable_count has been printed for each test case.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all the iterations. The variable qs, which represents the number of test cases, has been decremented to 0. The variables n and k, which represent the input values for each test case, have been updated to their final values. The variable reachable_count, which represents the output value for each test case, has been calculated and printed for each test case. The variable _, which is the loop counter, has been incremented to the final value of qs. The stdin, which contains the test cases, has been exhausted and contains no more test cases.
