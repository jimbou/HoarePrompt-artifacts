Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than its original value by 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the values of `qs`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `k` is now greater than or equal to 0, as it was decremented by `reachable_count - 1`, which is a positive integer less than or equal to `n`. The value of `reachable_count` is now less than its original value by 1, as it was decremented by 1. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing multiple test cases - 1.
