Output State: **k is 0, reachable_count is 1, qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: k is 0, reachable_count is 1, qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, _ is 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases - 1.
