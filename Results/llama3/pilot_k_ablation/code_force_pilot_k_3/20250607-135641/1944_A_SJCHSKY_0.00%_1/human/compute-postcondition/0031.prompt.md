Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a non-negative integer, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k + 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Code of the loop:
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
    k -= reachable_count - 1
    reachable_count -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is at least 0, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus reachable_count plus 1, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k - 1 and is equal to its original value minus 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value minus reachable_count plus 1 and k is greater than or equal to reachable_count - 1, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k - 1 and is equal to its original value minus 1 and reachable_count is greater than 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
