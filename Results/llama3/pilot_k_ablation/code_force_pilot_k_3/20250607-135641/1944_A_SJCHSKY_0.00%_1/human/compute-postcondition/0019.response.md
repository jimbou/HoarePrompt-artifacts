Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than or equal to its original value minus reachable_count, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n, less than its original value by 2, and less than or equal to k, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been reduced by the value of `reachable_count - 1`, and the value of `reachable_count` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
