The variables in the loop head are k and reachable_count, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables k and reachable_count. If k is greater than or equal to reachable_count - 1 and k is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is greater than or equal to 0, reachable_count is n-2. For the loop to be executed one more time, k must be greater than 0 and reachable_count must be less than or equal to k+1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 0, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is greater than 0, reachable_count is less than or equal to k+1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**
