To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `reachable_count` since these are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k` is greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and `k` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n*(n-1)/2 - (n-1)`, and `reachable_count` is equal to `n-1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1`, which means `k` must be greater than or equal to `n-2`. Since `k` is already greater than 0, we only need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to `n-2`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`qs` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, `k` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `n-2`, `reachable_count` is equal to `n-1`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1**
