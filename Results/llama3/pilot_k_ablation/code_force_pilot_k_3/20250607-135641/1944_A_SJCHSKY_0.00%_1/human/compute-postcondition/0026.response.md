Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, k is at least 0, reachable_count is a positive integer less than or equal to n and less than or equal to k, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decreased by `reachable_count - 1`, and the value of `reachable_count` has been decreased by 1. The values of `qs`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases - 1.
