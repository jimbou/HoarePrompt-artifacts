According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `reachable_count`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 0, `reachable_count` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n` and less than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 0 and `reachable_count` must be less than or equal to `k - 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`qs` is a positive integer greater than 2, `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 100, `k` is greater than 0, `reachable_count` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n` and less than or equal to `k - 1`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 1**
