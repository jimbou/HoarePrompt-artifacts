A `ValueError` might be triggered at `n, k = map(int, input().split())`, `a = list(map(int, input().split()))`, or `x = int(input())` if the input is not in the correct format (i.e., not a positive integer or not a non-negative integer). If the input is in the correct format, the program calculates the value of `b` by incrementing the absolute value of each input integer by the value of `a` at the corresponding index. Then, it checks if `n` times `k` is less than the value of `b` at index `i`. If it is, the program prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. If a `ValueError` occurs, the program prints "Invalid input format".

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of `a` at the corresponding index. If the input is in the correct format, the program prints 'YES' if `n` times `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `b` at index `i` for all `i`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If the input is not in the correct format, the program prints "Invalid input format".**
