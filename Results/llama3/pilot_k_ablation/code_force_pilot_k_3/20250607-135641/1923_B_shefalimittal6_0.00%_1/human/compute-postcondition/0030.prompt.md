You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two integers n and k separated by a space, then n integers separated by a space, and finally n integers separated by a space. n and k are positive integers, and the following n integers are non-negative integers.
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(n):
            x = int(input())
            
            b[abs(x)] += a[i]
            
        #State: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, k is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, b is a list of n + 1 integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of a at the corresponding index, stdin contains 0 inputs, i is n - 1, x is an integer.
        r = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            r += k
            
            if r < b[i]:
                print('NO')
                return
            
            r -= b[i]
            
        #State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of `a` at the corresponding index, `i` is `n`, `x` is an integer, `r` is `n` times `k`. If `n` times `k` is less than the value of `b` at index `i`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of `a` at the corresponding index. If the input is in the correct format, the program prints 'YES' if `n` times `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `b` at index `i` for all `i`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If the input is not in the correct format, the program prints "Invalid input format".

```

Return Postconditions: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of `a` at the corresponding index. If the input is in the correct format, the program prints 'YES' if `n` times `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `b` at index `i` for all `i`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If the input is not in the correct format, the program prints "Invalid input format".


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
