A `ValueError` might be triggered at `t = int(input())`. If the input cannot be converted to an integer, the `ValueError` is raised, and the program prints 'Invalid input format'. Otherwise, the program reads the number of test cases `t` and executes `func_1()` for each test case. 

Therefore, the output state is: `t` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers, and a value has been returned from the function `func_1()` if the input is valid, otherwise, the program prints 'Invalid input format'.
