Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers, and a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`**

The code snippet is simply a function call to `func_1()`, which does not modify any variables or stdin. The function call does not have any side effects on the variables `t` and `_`, and the stdin remains unchanged. The only effect is that a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`, but the value is not assigned to any variable. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`.
