The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of `a` at the corresponding index, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer, `r` is `k`, and `r` is greater than or equal to `b[i]`**
