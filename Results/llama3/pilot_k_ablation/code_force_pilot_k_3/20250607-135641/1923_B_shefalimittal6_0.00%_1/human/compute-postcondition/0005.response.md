To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variables in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer that must be greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 2, `_` is 2, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers, and a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`**
