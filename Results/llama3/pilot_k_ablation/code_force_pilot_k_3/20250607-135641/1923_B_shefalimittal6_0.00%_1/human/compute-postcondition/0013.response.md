Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of `a` at the corresponding index, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, the initial value of `r` is `k`, but the current value of `r` is less than the value of `b` at index `i`, and 'NO' is being printed**
