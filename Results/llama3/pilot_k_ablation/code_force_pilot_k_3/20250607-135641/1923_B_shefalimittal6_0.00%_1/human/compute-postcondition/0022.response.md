Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n + 1` integers where the absolute value of each input integer is incremented by the value of `a` at the corresponding index, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer, `r` is 2 times `k` plus `k` which is 3 times `k`. If 2 times `k` plus `k` which is 3 times `k` is less than the value of `b` at index `i`, then 'NO' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `r` is increased by `k`, and now it is equal to 3 times `k`. The values of the other variables remain the same. If the new value of `r` is less than the value of `b` at index `i`, then 'NO' is printed.
