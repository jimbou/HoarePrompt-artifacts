Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers, and a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function `func_1()` has been executed and has returned a value. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the sequence of test cases.
