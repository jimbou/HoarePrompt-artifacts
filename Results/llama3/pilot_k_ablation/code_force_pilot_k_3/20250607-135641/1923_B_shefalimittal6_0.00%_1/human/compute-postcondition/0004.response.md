Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 1, `_` is 1, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers, and a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`**

The code snippet only calls the function `func_1()` without modifying any variables or reading from stdin. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional information that a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`.
