According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers.**
