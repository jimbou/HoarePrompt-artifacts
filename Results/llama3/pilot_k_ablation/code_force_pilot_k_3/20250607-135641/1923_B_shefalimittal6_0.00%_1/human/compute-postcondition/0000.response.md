The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to the variable `t`. The stdin contains a sequence of inputs: first an integer, then a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers. After the code is executed, the first integer is consumed from the stdin, and the remaining inputs are still present in the stdin.

Output State: **`t` is an integer, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers.**
