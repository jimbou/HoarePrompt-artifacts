Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `_` is `t-1`, stdin contains a sequence of test cases, where each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains two integers, the second line contains a list of integers, and the third line contains a list of integers, and a value has been returned from the function `func_1()`**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is the initial value of the variable `t`. The variable `_` has been incremented `t-1` times, and the function `func_1()` has been called `t` times, returning a value each time. The state of the input stream `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing a sequence of test cases, each consisting of three lines: two integers, a list of integers, and another list of integers.
