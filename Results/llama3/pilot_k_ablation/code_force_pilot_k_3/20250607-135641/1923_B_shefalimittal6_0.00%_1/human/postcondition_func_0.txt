This function determines whether a given set of inputs can be processed within a certain capacity. It takes three inputs: two positive integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` non-negative integers, and then `n` integers. The function calculates a cumulative sum `r` by adding `k` for each of the `n` integers, and then subtracting the corresponding value from the list `b` (which is constructed by incrementing the absolute value of each input integer by the value of `a` at the corresponding index). If at any point `r` is less than the value of `b` at the current index, the function prints 'NO' and returns. If the function completes the calculation without printing 'NO', it implicitly prints 'YES' (although this is not explicitly stated in the code, it can be inferred from the context). If the input is not in the correct format, the function prints 'Invalid input format'.
