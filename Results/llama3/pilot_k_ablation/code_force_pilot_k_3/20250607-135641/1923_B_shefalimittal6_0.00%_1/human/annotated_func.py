If the input is in the correct format, the program prints 'YES' if `n` times `k` is greater than or equal to the value of `b` at index `i` for all `i`, otherwise it prints 'NO'.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a given set of inputs can be processed within a certain capacity. It takes three inputs: two positive integers `n` and `k`, followed by `n` non-negative integers, and then `n` integers. The function calculates a cumulative sum `r` by adding `k` for each of the `n` integers, and then subtracting the corresponding value from the list `b` (which is constructed by incrementing the absolute value of each input integer by the value of `a` at the corresponding index). If at any point `r` is less than the value of `b` at the current index, the function prints 'NO' and returns. If the function completes the calculation without printing 'NO', it implicitly prints 'YES' (although this is not explicitly stated in the code, it can be inferred from the context). If the input is not in the correct format, the function prints 'Invalid input format'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains a sequence of inputs: first an integer, then a sequence of test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then iterates over the range of this integer, calling another function (`func_1`) for each iteration. If the input is not a valid integer, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value but performs actions based on the input and the result of the called function (`func_1`).
