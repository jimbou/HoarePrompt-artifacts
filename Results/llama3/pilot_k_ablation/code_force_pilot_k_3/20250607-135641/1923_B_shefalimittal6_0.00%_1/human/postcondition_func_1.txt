This function reads an integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases. It then iterates over the range of this integer, calling another function (`func_1`) for each iteration. If the input is not a valid integer, it prints 'Invalid input format'. The function does not return any value but performs actions based on the input and the result of the called function (`func_1`).
