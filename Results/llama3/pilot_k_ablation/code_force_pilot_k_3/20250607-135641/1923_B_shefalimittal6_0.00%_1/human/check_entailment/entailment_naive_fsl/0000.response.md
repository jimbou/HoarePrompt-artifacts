Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. In the given code, the function `func_1()` is designed to handle a single test case, but it does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple test cases. The function `func_2()` is designed to handle multiple test cases, but it does not correctly handle the case when the input is not in the correct format.

For example, if the input is:

```
2
3 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
2 1
1 1
-1 1
```

The program will not work correctly because it does not correctly handle the case when there are multiple test cases.

Also, the program does not correctly handle the case when the input is not in the correct format. For example, if the input is:

```
a 2
1 2 3
-1 2 3
```

The program will not work correctly because it does not correctly handle the case when the input is not in the correct format.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and the correctness is **False**.
