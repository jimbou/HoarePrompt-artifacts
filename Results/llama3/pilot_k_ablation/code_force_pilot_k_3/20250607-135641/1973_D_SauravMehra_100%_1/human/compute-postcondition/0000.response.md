Output State: **tar is a list of positive integers, k and n are positive integers such that k <= n and n is the length of tar, it is 0, ind is 0**

The code initializes two new variables, `it` and `ind`, and assigns them the value 0. The rest of the variables, `tar`, `k`, and `n`, remain unchanged. The length of `tar` is still `n`, and `k` is still less than or equal to `n`. The values of `it` and `ind` are now 0.
