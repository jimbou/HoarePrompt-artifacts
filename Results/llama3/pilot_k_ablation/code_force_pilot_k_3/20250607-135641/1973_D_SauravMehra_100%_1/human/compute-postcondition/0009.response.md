Based on the precondition, let's analyze the print statement:

`print(f'? {ind + 1} {tar}')`

Here's what we know:

* `ind` is 0
* `tar` is a list of positive integers
* `x` is an integer, but it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it
* `it` is 0, but it's not used in the print statement, so we can ignore it
* `k` and `n` are not used in the print statement, so we can ignore them

Now, let's break down the print statement:

* `f'? {ind + 1} {tar}'` is a formatted string literal (f-string)
* `ind + 1` will be evaluated to 1, since `ind` is 0
* `{tar}` will be replaced with the string representation of the `tar` list

So, the output will be a string that starts with a question mark (`?`), followed by the string representation of the `tar` list, with the index `ind + 1` (which is 1) prepended to it.

Output: **? 1 [tar list]** (where [tar list] is the string representation of the tar list, e.g. [1, 2, 3, ...])
