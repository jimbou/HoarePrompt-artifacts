According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `ind` and `it`. If `ind` is less than `n` and `it` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `ind` is 0, `it` is 0, `n` is the length of `tar`, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `ind` must be less than `n` and `it` must be less than `k`. Since `ind` is 0, it is already less than `n`. However, since `it` is 0 and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`tar` is a list of positive integers, `k` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, `n` is the length of `tar`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, stdin is empty, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`**
