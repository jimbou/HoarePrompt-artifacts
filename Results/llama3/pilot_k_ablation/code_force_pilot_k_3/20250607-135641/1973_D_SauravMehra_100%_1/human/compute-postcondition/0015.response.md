Output State: **The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the index 'ind' is equal to the length of the list 'tar' and the iterator 'it' is equal to the positive integer 'k'.**

In this output state, the boolean value returned by the program is based on the conditions `ind == n` and `it == k`. Since `ind` is equal to `x` and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, the first condition `ind == n` is not guaranteed to be true. However, since `it` is equal to `k`, the second condition `it == k` is true. Therefore, the program returns a boolean value that depends on the value of `x` relative to `n`.
