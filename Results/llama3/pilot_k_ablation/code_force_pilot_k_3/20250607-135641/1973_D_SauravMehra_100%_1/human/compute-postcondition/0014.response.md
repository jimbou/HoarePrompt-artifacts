Output State: **`tar` is a list of positive integers, `k` and `n` are positive integers such that `k <= n`, `n` is the length of `tar`, `it` is equal to `k`, `ind` is equal to `x`, `x` is an integer, stdin is empty, and `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, and this is printed: "? 1 [tar]" repeated `k` times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The list `tar` remains unchanged, containing only positive integers.
* The values of `k` and `n` remain unchanged, with `k` being less than or equal to `n`, and `n` being the length of `tar`.
* The variable `it` is now equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times.
* The variable `ind` is now equal to the value of `x`, which is an integer.
* The input stream `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed.
* The value of `x` is not equal to `n + 1`, which means that the loop did not terminate early.
* The string "? 1 [tar]" is printed `k` times, indicating that the loop executed `k` iterations.
