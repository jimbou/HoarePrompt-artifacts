Output State: **`tar` is a list of positive integers, `k` and `n` are positive integers such that `k <= n`, `n` is the length of `tar`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0, `x` is an integer, and stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `tar`, `k`, `n`, `it`, and `ind` remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `x` is assigned the value of an integer from the input, and since the input is consumed, stdin is now empty.
