To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `ind < n` and `it < k`.

Given the initial state:
- `tar` is a list of positive integers
- `k` and `n` are positive integers such that `k <= n`
- `n` is the length of `tar`
- `it` is 0
- `ind` is 0

We need to adjust the states of `it`, `ind`, `n`, and `k` if necessary to ensure the loop can execute at least once.

1. For `ind < n`, since `ind` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer (and also the length of `tar`, which is not empty because it contains positive integers), this condition is already satisfied. No adjustment is needed for `ind` or `n` regarding this condition.

2. For `it < k`, since `it` is 0 and `k` is a positive integer, this condition is also satisfied. However, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to make sure that `k` is greater than 0 because `it` is already at 0. Given that `k` is already defined as a positive integer, this condition is inherently satisfied. No explicit adjustment is needed for `k` or `it` regarding this condition.

However, considering the relationship between `k` and `n` (`k <= n`), and knowing that both are positive integers, we should ensure that `k` is indeed greater than 0 to satisfy the condition `it < k` for at least one iteration. Since `k` is already a positive integer, the condition is satisfied without needing an explicit adjustment in the state description. The critical insight is recognizing that the initial conditions already imply that both conditions for the loop (`ind < n` and `it < k`) are met without needing further adjustments.

State: **`tar` is a list of positive integers, `k` and `n` are positive integers such that `k <= n`, `n` is the length of `tar`, `it` is 0, `ind` is 0**
