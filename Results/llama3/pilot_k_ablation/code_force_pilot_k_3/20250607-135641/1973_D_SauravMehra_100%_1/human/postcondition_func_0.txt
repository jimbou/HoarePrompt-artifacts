This function takes a list of positive integers `tar`, and two positive integers `k` and `n` as input, where `k` is less than or equal to `n` and `n` is the length of `tar`. It repeatedly prompts the user for input `k` times, printing a message in the format "? 1 [tar]" each time. The function then returns a boolean value indicating whether the final user input `x` is equal to the length of `tar` and the number of iterations `it` is equal to `k`. If the user inputs `n + 1` at any point, the function immediately returns `False`.
