Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the maximum value `mx` that can be achieved by multiplying the length of the array with the maximum value in the array. This is done by repeatedly asking queries of the form "? 1 (n * mx)" until the answer is `n`.

2. Then, it calculates the target value `tar` by dividing the length of the array `n` by the number of subarrays `k` and multiplying it with `mx`. This is the maximum possible value that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.

3. The program then enters a loop where it checks if the current `tar` value can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays. This is done by calling the function `func_1(tar, k, n)`.

4. If `func_1(tar, k, n)` returns `True`, it means that the current `tar` value can be achieved, and the program prints "! tar" to output the answer.

5. If `func_1(tar, k, n)` returns `False`, it means that the current `tar` value cannot be achieved, and the program decrements `tar` by `mx` and repeats the loop.

6. If the loop ends without finding a valid `tar` value, the program prints "! -1" to indicate that no valid answer exists.

7. The function `func_1(tar, k, n)` checks if the current `tar` value can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays. It does this by repeatedly asking queries of the form "? (ind + 1) tar" and checking if the answer is `n + 1`. If the answer is `n + 1`, it means that the current `tar` value cannot be achieved, and the function returns `False`. If the function is able to split the array into `k` subarrays with the current `tar` value, it returns `True`.

8. The program then reads the response from the judge and checks if it is `-1`. If it is, the program exits immediately.

Correctness: **True**
