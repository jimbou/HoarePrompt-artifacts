Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, the program does not handle the case when the maximum value `mx` is not a multiple of `n // k`. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct `tar` value and will incorrectly print `-1` as the answer.

For example, consider the case when `n = 10`, `k = 3`, and the hidden array is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`. The maximum value `mx` is `10`, but `n // k` is `3`. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct `tar` value and will incorrectly print `-1` as the answer.

The program should be modified to handle this case correctly. One possible solution is to use a more sophisticated algorithm to find the correct `tar` value, such as using a binary search approach.
