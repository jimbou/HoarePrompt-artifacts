Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 2 and `x // 2`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 2.**

Explanation: The code appends the value of `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is 2, the value appended to `l` is `x // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains three values: 1, 2, and `x // 2`. The maximum value in `l` is still `ans`, which is 2. The stdin remains the same, containing `t-1` lines, each with two integers `x` and `n`.
