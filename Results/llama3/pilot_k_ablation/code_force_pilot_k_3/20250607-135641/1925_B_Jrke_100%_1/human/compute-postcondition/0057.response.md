Postcondition: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 3 and if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is 3, `ans` is 3 if `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // 3`, `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 2, and `x // 3` if `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 2, and 3. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // 3` is added to the list `l`, making it a list containing four values: 1, 2, 3, and `x // 3` if `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing four values: 1, 2, 3, and `x // 3`. `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
