Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing two values: 1 and 2, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).***
