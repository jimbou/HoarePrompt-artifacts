Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `l` now contains two elements: the original value of `ans` (which is 1) and the current value of `i` (which is also 1). All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
