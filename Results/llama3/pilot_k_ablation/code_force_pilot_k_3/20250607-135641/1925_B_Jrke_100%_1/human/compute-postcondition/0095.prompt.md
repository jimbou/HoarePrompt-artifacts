Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 1, x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of ans which is 1, i is the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer and if x divided by i is less than or equal to k, then x divided by i is added to the list l, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains three elements: 1, 1, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains two elements: 1 and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 2, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, `x // i`, and 3. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `x // i`, and 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l` and 3. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
