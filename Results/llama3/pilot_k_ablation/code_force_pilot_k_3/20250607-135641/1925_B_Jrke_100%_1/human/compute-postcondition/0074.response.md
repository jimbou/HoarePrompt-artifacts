Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing three elements: 1, 1, and `x // i`, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains three elements: 1, 1, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains two elements: 1 and `x // i`. The current value of `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i` remains the same. The list `l` now contains three elements: 1, 1, and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The stdin still contains `t-5` lines, each with two integers `x` and `n`. The divisibility of `x` by `i` and the relationship between `i`, `k`, and the length of list `l` are still maintained.
