Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `stdin`, and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. A new list `l` is created with the value of `ans` which is 1.
