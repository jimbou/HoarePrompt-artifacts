Output State: **t is 0, x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is the maximum value of the list l, l is a list containing the values of ans which is 1, i which is the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer and if x divided by i is less than or equal to k, then x divided by i is added to the list l, stdin is empty, and the maximum value in the list l which is ans has been printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations specified by the initial value of t. The values of x, n, and k are the same as in the previous iterations, but the value of ans has been updated to be the maximum value in the list l. The list l contains the values of ans, i, and x divided by i if x is divisible by i and x divided by i is less than or equal to k. The stdin is empty because all the input lines have been processed. The maximum value in the list l, which is ans, has been printed.
