Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, and `x` divided by 2 if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the maximum value of the list `l` and `x` divided by 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains the maximum value of the list `l` and `x` divided by 2, and possibly 2 if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The stdin still contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`.
