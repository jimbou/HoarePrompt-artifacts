Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The integer division of `x` by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains an additional element, which is the integer division of `x` by `i`. This is because the code `l.append(x // i)` adds this value to the end of the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `l`, `stdin`, and `i` are still valid.
