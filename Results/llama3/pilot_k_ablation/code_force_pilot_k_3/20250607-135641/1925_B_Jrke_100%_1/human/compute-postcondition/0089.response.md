Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 3, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, `x // i`, and 3. Otherwise, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, `x // i`, and 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l` and 3.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3. The list `l` has been updated by appending the value of `i`, which is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i` (which is 3), then the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, `x // i`, and 3 if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, `x // i`, and 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l` and 3.
