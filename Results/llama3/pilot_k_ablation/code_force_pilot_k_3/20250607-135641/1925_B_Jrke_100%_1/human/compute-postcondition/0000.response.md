According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x). So for the loop to be executed, `t` must be greater than 0 and the input must be consumed so that the loop can execute. 
State: **stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= x <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= n <= x), `t` must be greater than 0**
