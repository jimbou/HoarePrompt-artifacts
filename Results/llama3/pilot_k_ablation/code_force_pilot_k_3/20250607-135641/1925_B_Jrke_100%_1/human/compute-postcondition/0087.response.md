To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 3.


The other variables in the state (`t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `l`) are not affected by the loop head and should remain unchanged.


State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 3, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
