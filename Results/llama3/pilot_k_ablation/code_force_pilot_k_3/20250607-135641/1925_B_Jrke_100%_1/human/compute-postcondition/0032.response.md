The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be decreased by 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is `int(x)`, and the maximum value in the list `l` which is `ans` is being printed**
