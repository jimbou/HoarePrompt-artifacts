Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing two elements: 1 and 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains two elements: 1 and 1. Otherwise, the list `l` contains only one element: 1.***
