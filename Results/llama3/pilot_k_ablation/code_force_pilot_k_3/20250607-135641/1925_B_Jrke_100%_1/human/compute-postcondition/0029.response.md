Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, x is at least 1, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is the maximum value in the list l, l is a list containing the values of ans which is 1 and i if i is less than or equal to k and the integer division of x by i, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), i is int(x ** 0.5) + 2. If x is divisible by i, then the integer division of x by i is added to l if it is less than or equal to k.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variable `i` has reached its final value of `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. The list `l` contains the maximum value of `ans` which is 1, and the values of `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i` if they are less than or equal to `k`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
