To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i`, `x`, and the expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1.

The state of `x` does not need to be adjusted because it is not modified in the loop head.

The expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` does not need to be adjusted because it is a constant expression that depends on `x`, which is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains three elements: 1, 1, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains two elements: 1 and `x // i`.**
