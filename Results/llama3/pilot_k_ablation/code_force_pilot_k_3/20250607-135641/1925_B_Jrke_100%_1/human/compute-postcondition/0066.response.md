Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of ans which is 1, i is the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer and if x divided by i is less than or equal to k, then x divided by i is added to the list l, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x).**

The code reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to `x` and `n`. The value of `k` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `ans` is set to 1. The list `l` contains the value of `ans`, which is 1. The value of `i` is the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`.
