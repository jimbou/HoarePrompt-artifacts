Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is the maximum value in the list l, l is a list containing the values of ans which is 1, i which is the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer and if x divided by i is less than or equal to k, then x divided by i is added to the list l, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), and the maximum value in the list l which is ans is being printed**
