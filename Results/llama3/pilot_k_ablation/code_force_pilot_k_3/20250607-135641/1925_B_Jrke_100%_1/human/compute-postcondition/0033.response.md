Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 0, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of ans which is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), i is not defined**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `l` have been updated based on the execution of the code snippet. The value of `x` and `n` are now specific integers between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, and `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `ans` is now 1, and the list `l` contains only the value of `ans` which is 1. The `stdin` now contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The variable `i` is no longer defined.
