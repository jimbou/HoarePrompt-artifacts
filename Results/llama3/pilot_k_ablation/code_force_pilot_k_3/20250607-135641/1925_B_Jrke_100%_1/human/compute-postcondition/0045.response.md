The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 2 and if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
