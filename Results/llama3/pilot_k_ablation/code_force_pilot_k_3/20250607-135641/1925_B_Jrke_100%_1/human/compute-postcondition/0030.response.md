The code prints the maximum value in the list `l`, which contains the values of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`.

Since `k` is the integer division of `x` by `n`, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x/n`.

The list `l` will contain the values of `ans` (which is 1) and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`. Since `i` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, the integer division of `x` by `i` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x/i`.

Therefore, the maximum value in the list `l` will be the largest integer less than or equal to `x/n`, which is `k`.

Output: **k (which is the integer division of x by n)**
