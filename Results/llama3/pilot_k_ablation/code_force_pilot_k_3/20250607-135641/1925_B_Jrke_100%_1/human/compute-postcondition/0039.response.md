Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` is added to the list `l`.***
