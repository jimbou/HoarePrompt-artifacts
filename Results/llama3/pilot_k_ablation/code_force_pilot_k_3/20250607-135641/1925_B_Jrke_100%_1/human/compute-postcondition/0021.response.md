The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and the integer division of `x` by `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is added to `l` if it is less than or equal to `k`.**
