To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1. Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 1, as it is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 1**
