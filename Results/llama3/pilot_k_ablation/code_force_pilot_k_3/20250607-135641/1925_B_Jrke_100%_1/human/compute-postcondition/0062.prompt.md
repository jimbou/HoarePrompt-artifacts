Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer greater than 0, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8 inclusive, n is an integer between 1 and x inclusive, k is an integer equal to the integer division of x by n, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of ans which is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), i is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 1 and if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 2 and if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is 2, `ans` is 2 if `x // 2` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // 2`, `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 2, and `x // 2` if `x // 2` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing two values: 1 and 2. `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 3 and if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is 3, `ans` is 3 if `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // 3`, `l` is a list containing four values: 1, 2, 3, and `x // 3` if `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing four values: 1, 2, 3, and `x // 3`. `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 2, and `x // 3` if `x // 3` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 2, and 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
