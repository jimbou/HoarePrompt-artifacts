Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` which is 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to only contain the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-3` lines of input.
