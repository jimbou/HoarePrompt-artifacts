Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 3. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `x` is divisible by `i`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, `x // i`, and 3 if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, `x // i`, and 3. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l` and 3. If `i` is greater than `k`, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and `l` is now a list containing only the maximum value of the list `l`.**

The code appends `x // i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is 3, the value of `x // i` is appended to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the maximum value of the list `l` and `x // i`.
