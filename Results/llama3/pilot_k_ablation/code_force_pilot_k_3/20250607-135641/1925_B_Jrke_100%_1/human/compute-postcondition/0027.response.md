Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 3 and `x // 3`, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), and `i` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains the values 1, 3, and `x // 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The value of `i` is still 3.
