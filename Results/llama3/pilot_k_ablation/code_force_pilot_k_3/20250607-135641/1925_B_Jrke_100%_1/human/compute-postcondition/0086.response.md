Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 2, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, 2, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
