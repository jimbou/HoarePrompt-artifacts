The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The initial state of `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1. The value of `i` is 1. Therefore, the list `l` now contains two elements: 1 and 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing two elements: 1 and 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
