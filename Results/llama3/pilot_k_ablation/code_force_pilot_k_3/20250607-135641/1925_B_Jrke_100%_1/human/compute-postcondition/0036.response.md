Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the given code `l = [ans]` does not change any of the variables except `l`, which is now a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state.
