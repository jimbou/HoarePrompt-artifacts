Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 1 and if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`, which contains the initial value of `ans` (1), the value of `i` (1), and any additional values that are less than or equal to `k` (the integer division of `x` by `n`). The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `l` remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` also remains unchanged, with `t-3` lines of two integers each.
