Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains the maximum value of the list `l` and `x // i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root, and the maximum value of the list `l` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`. The value of `i` is the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer plus 1, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
