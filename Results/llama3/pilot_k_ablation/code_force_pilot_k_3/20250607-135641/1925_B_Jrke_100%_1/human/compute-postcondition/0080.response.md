Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing the maximum value of the list `l`, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains only one element, which is the maximum value of the original list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-5` lines, each with two integers `x` and `n`.
