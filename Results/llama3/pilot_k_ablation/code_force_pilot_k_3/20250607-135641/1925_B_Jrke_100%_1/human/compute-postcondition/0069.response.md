Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to be a list containing the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, which is 1.
