Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `i` remains the same as in the initial state. The list `l` now contains two values: the initial value of `ans` which is 1 and the value of `i` which is also 1. The stdin still contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The divisibility of `x` by `i` and the relation of `i` with `k` also remains the same.
