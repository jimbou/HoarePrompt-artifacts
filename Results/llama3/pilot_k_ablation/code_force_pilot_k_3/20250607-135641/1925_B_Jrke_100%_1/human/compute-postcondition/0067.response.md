To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is in the range from 1 to the square root of `x` rounded up to the nearest integer plus 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
