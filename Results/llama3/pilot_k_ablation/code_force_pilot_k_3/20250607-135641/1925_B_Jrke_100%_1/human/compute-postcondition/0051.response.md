Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 2 if `x // 2` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // 2`, `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 2, and `x // 2` if `x // 2` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing two values: 1 and 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // 2` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x // 2`. The list `l` remains the same, containing either three values (1, 2, and `x // 2`) or two values (1 and 2), depending on the value of `x // 2` compared to `k`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` also remains the same, containing `t-3` lines of two integers each.
