Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `x` is at least 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), `i` is 3.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-1` lines of input. The value of `ans` is still the maximum value in the list `l`, which is now either 1 or 3, depending on the previous value of `ans`.
