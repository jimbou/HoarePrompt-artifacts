The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` inclusive, `k` is an integer equal to the integer division of `x` by `n`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` which is the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer and if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x` divided by `i` is added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-4` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
