Determines if a tree data structure meets certain conditions based on the number of connected components and their sizes. It takes a tree, an integer k, and an integer x as input, where x represents the minimum size of each connected component. The function returns True if the number of connected components with size at least x is greater than k, or if it is equal to k and the total size of the remaining components is greater than or equal to x. Otherwise, it returns False.
