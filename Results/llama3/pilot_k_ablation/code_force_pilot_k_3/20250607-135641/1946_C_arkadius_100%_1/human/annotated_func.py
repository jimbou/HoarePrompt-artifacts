#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the minimum or maximum number of vertices in a tree data structure by iteratively narrowing down the range of possible values. It takes a tree, the number of vertices, and the number of edges to be removed as input, and returns either 1 or the total number of vertices.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, and the next n-1 lines of input contain two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n) representing the edges of the tree.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the user, constructs a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, and then calls another function (func_4) to perform some operation on the tree. The result of this operation is then printed to the console. The function does not modify the input variables n and k, but it does modify the tree by adding edges to it. The final state of the program is that the tree has been constructed and the result of the operation performed by func_4 has been printed.
