Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing the lower and upper bounds of the search range to 1 and n, respectively. Then, it iteratively checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the current mid value.

The program uses a recursive function (func_2) to count the number of good components (components with size at least x) and the remaining size of the tree. The function works by recursively traversing the tree, counting the number of good components and the remaining size of each subtree, and then combining the results.

The program also uses a function (func_3) to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function uses the results from func_2 to determine if the number of good components is greater than or equal to k and if the remaining size of the tree is at least x.

The main function (func_5) reads the input, constructs the tree, and calls func_4 to find the maximum value of x.

The program appears to be correct, as it uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x and correctly checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Correctness: **True**
