Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program first constructs a tree data structure from the input edges, and then uses a recursive function (func_1) to calculate the number of good components (connected components with at least x vertices) and the remaining size (the total size of the remaining connected components with less than x vertices) for each vertex in the tree.

The program then uses a binary search function (func_4) to find the maximum value of x such that the number of good components is greater than or equal to k, or the number of good components is equal to k and the remaining size is greater than or equal to x.

The program correctly handles the base cases for the binary search, and the recursive function correctly calculates the number of good components and the remaining size for each vertex.

Therefore, the program is correct and will produce the correct output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
