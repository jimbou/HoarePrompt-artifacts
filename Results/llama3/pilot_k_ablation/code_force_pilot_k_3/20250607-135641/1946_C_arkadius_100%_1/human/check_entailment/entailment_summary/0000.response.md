Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program consists of multiple functions, each with a specific purpose:

- `func_1` and `func_2` are used to calculate the number of connected components with at least a minimum size and the total size of components smaller than the minimum size in a subtree rooted at a given vertex.

- `func_3` determines if a tree meets certain conditions based on the number of connected components and their sizes.

- `func_4` uses binary search to find the maximum number of vertices in a tree that meets the conditions specified in `func_3`.

- `func_5` reads input from the user, constructs a tree, and calls `func_4` to perform the operation.

The program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem. It constructs a tree from the input, roots the tree, and then uses binary search to find the maximum number x that meets the conditions. The final result is printed to the console.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the given program is correct.
