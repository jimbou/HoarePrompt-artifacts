Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the binary search in Function 4. The binary search is used to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. However, the program does not correctly update the end variable in the binary search loop. The end variable should be updated to mid - 1 when the function func_3 returns False, but the program updates it to mid - 1 regardless of the return value of func_3. This can cause the program to return an incorrect result.

For example, if the input is n = 5, k = 1, and the tree is:

1 -- 2
|    |
3 -- 4
|
5

The program should return 2, but it will return 1 because of the incorrect binary search implementation.
