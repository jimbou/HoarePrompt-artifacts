Output State: **`beg` is either 1 or `n`, `end` is either 1 or `n`, `mid` is either 1 or `n`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `beg`, `end`, and `mid` will either be 1 or `n`, depending on the outcome of the `func_3` function calls during the loop iterations. The tree data structure and the number of vertices `n` and edges to be removed `k` remain unchanged.
