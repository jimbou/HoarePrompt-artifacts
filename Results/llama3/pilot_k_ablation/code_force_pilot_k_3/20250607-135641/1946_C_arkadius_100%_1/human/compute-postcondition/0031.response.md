Output State: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least `k` child vertices, where `k` is the number of child vertices of `v`, `u` is the last child vertex of `v`. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value, the value of `good_components[u]`, and 1, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]` if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`. If the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has iterated over all child vertices of the root vertex `v`. For each child vertex `u`, if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, the value of `good_components[v]` is increased by 1 and the value of `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`. If the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`, the value of `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]` and the value of `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`. The loop has executed for all child vertices of `v`, and the final values of `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` are determined based on the remaining sizes of all child vertices.
