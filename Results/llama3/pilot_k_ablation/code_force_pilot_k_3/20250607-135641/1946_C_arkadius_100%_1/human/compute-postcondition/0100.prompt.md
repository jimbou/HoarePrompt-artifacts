You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a tree data structure with n vertices, s is the root vertex of the tree, and x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component.
    stack = [(s, False)]
    good_components = {}
    remaining_size = {}
    while stack:
        v, postorder = stack.pop()
        
        if not postorder:
            stack.append((v, True))
            good_components[v] = 0
            remaining_size[v] = 1
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                stack.append((u, False))
        elif postorder:
            for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
                good_components[v] += good_components[u]
                if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                    good_components[v] += 1
                else:
                    remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]
        
    #State: The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. The stack is an empty list. The good_components dictionary contains the number of good components for each vertex, where a good component is a connected component with at least `x` vertices. The remaining_size dictionary contains the remaining size of each vertex, which is the sum of the sizes of its children that are not good components.
    return good_components[s], remaining_size[s]
    #The program returns the number of good components for the root vertex `s` and the remaining size of the root vertex `s`. The number of good components for the root vertex `s` is the number of connected components with at least `x` vertices that are rooted at `s`. The remaining size of the root vertex `s` is the sum of the sizes of its children that are not good components.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the number of good components for the root vertex `s` and the remaining size of the root vertex `s`. The number of good components for the root vertex `s` is the number of connected components with at least `x` vertices that are rooted at `s`. The remaining size of the root vertex `s` is the sum of the sizes of its children that are not good components.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
