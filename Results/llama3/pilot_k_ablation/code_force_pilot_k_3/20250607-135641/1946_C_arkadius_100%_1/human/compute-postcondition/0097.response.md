Postcondition: ***The stack has been updated, and the tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. If the postorder is empty, the top element (v, True) has been removed from the stack, good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, and tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, where n is the number of children of v. If the postorder is not empty, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] is increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack is not empty, and the list of children in tree.vertices[v] is empty.***
