Postcondition: ***The top element (v, postorder) has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] is increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack is not empty. The postorder is not empty. If the postorder is not empty, the value of good_components[v] has been increased by the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of v, plus the number of children u of v for which remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x. The value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of v for which remaining_size[u] is less than x. The stack, postorder, and the current value of postorder remain unchanged. The list of children in tree.vertices[v] is empty.***
