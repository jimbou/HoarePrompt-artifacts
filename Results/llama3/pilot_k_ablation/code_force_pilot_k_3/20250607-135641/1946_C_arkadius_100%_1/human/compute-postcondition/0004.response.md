The code snippet provided is a loop that runs n-2 times, each time reading two integers from stdin, subtracting 1 from each, and adding an edge to the tree between the resulting nodes.

After the code executes, the tree will have n-2 additional edges, each connecting two nodes that were specified in the input. The nodes are 0-indexed, meaning that the first node is node 0, the second node is node 1, and so on.

The value of i remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code.

The values of n and k also remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code.

Stdin is empty after the code executes, as all n-2 lines of input have been read.

Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, i is 2, tree is a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, stdin is empty**
