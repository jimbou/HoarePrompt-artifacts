The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, n is greater than 2, tree is a tree with n nodes and an additional edge between nodes u-1 and v-1, i is 2, stdin contains n-2 lines of input, each containing two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n) representing the edges of the tree.**
