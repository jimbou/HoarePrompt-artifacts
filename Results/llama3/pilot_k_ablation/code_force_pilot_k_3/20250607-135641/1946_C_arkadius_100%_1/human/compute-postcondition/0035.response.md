Output State: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is [(s, True), (u, False), (u, False), (u, False), ..., (u, False)] and it has at least one element, `good_components` is {s: 0}, `remaining_size` is {s: 1}, and `v` is the root vertex `s`, where `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least `k` children, and `u` is the `k`th child of `v`. If `postorder` is `True`, then `stack` is not empty, and if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value, the value of `good_components[u]`, and 1, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`. If the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`. The stack has been popped and the top element `(v, postorder)` has been removed.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the top element `(v, postorder)` removed from the stack. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
