Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is an empty dictionary, `remaining_size` is an empty dictionary, `v` is the root vertex `s`, and the current value of `postorder` is `True`
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by 1 if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `u`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary where the current value of `u` is greater than or equal to `x` if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`, `v` is the root vertex `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child vertex, `u` is the first child vertex of `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by 1 if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`, `v` is the root vertex `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two child vertices, `u` is the second child vertex of `v`, and the value of `good_components[v]` is now the sum of its previous value and 1 if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `good_components[v]` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]` if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three child vertices, `u` is the third child vertex of `v`. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value, the value of `good_components[u]`, and 1, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]` if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`. If the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
