Output State: **The program returns the number of good components for the root vertex `s` and the remaining size of the root vertex `s`. The number of good components for the root vertex `s` is the number of connected components with at least `x` vertices that are rooted at `s`. The remaining size of the root vertex `s` is the sum of the sizes of its children that are not good components.**
