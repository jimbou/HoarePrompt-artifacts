Postcondition: ***The tree data structure has `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. `postorder` is `True`, indicating that the postorder traversal has been performed. The `stack` is not empty, and `good_components` and `remaining_size` have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element `(v, postorder)` has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, and `stack` maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, if `postorder` is `True`, then for each child `u` of `v`, if `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]` plus 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.***
