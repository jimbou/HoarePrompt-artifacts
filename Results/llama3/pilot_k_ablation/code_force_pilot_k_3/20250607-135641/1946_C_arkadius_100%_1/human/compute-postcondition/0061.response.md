Output State: **The tree data structure has `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. `postorder` is `True`, indicating that the postorder traversal has been performed. The `stack` is not empty, and `good_components` and `remaining_size` have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element `(v, postorder)` has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, and `stack` maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, indicating that the postorder traversal has been completed. `v` has at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of `v`. `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`. `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure remains unchanged with `n` vertices and `s` as the root vertex. The postorder traversal has been completed, and the stack is not empty. The `good_components` and `remaining_size` have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element `(v, postorder)` has been removed from the stack. The relationships and values of the tree vertices, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, and `stack` remain the same as before. The value of `good_components[v]` has been increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, and the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.
