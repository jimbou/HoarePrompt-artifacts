Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, `i` is n-1, `tree` is a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, and the root of the tree has been visited in a non-recursive manner starting from node 0 with parent -1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `tree` has been modified by visiting its root in a non-recursive manner, starting from node 0 with parent -1. This means that the root node (node 0) has been processed, and its children have been visited accordingly. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
