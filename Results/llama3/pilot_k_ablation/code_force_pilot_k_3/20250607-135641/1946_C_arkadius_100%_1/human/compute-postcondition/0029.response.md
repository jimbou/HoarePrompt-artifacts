Output State: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three child vertices, `u` is the third child vertex of `v`, `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]` if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`, and the value of `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure remains the same with `n` vertices and `s` as the root vertex. The minimum size of each connected component is still represented by the positive integer `x`. The stack is still empty, and the postorder traversal is still set to `True`. The children of vertex `v` are still at least three, with `u` being the third child vertex. The value of `good_components[v]` has been updated to include the value of `good_components[u]`. The remaining size of vertex `v` has been increased by the remaining size of vertex `u`, but only if the remaining size of `u` is less than the minimum size `x`.
