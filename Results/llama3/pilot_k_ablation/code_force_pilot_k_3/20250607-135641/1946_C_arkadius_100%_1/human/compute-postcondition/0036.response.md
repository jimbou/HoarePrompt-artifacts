Output State: **The stack has an additional element (v, True), good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1. All other variables and data structures remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the stack has been updated with a new element (v, True), indicating that the vertex v will be processed in postorder. The good_components dictionary now has a new entry for vertex v with a value of 0, indicating that no good components have been found for this vertex yet. The remaining_size dictionary also has a new entry for vertex v with a value of 1, indicating that the remaining size of this vertex is 1. All other variables and data structures, including the tree, s, x, postorder, u, k, and the original values of good_components and remaining_size, remain unchanged.
