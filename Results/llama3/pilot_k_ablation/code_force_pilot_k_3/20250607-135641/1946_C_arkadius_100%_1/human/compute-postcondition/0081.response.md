Output State: **The top element (v, postorder) has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] was greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] was increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack is not empty. The postorder is not empty. The current value of postorder is not empty. tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, u is the first child in the list. good_components[v] has been increased by good_components[u] plus 1. The current value of remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code increments the value of good_components[v] by 1. The relationships and values of the tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack remain the same as before. The stack and postorder are not empty, and the list of children of v has at least one child, u. The value of good_components[v] has been increased by the value of good_components[u] plus 1, and the value of remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x.
