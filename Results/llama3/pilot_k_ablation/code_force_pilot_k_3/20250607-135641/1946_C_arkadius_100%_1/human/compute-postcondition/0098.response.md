Output State: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. The stack is an empty list. The good_components dictionary contains the number of good components for each vertex, where a good component is a connected component with at least `x` vertices. The remaining_size dictionary contains the remaining size of each vertex, which is the sum of the sizes of its children that are not good components.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, where each vertex has a number of good components and a remaining size. The good components are the connected components with at least `x` vertices, and the remaining size is the sum of the sizes of the children that are not good components. The stack is empty, indicating that the loop has finished executing.
