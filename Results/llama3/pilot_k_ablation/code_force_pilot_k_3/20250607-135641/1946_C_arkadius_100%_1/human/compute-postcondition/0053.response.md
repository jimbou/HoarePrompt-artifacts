State: **The tree data structure has `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. `postorder` is `True`, indicating that the postorder traversal has been performed. The `stack` is not empty, and `good_components` and `remaining_size` have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element `(v, postorder)` has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, and `stack` maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, indicating that the postorder traversal has been completed. `v` has at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of `v`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is now equal to its previous value plus `good_components[u]` plus 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is now equal to its previous value plus `good_components[u]`, and the remaining size of `v` is now equal to the sum of its previous remaining size and the remaining size of `u`.**
