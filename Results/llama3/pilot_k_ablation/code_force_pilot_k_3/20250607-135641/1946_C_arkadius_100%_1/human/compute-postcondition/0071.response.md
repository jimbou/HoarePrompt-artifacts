The only objects in the loop head are variables  u and tree.vertices[v].children, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tree.vertices[v].children.  If the list has at least 2 children the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, tree.vertices[v].children has at least 1 child, u is the first child of v. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 children and the u is the second child of v.
State: **The stack has been updated with the top element (v, True) and the new element (u, False), good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 2 children, u is the second child of v**
