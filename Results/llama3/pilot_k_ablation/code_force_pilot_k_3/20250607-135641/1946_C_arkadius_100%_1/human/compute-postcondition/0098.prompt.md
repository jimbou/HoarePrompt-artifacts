Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a tree data structure with n vertices, s is the root vertex of the tree, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is a list containing a tuple with the root vertex s and a boolean value False, good_components is an empty dictionary, and remaining_size is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        good_components[v] = 0
        remaining_size[v] = 1
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    elif postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            good_components[v] += good_components[u]
            if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                good_components[v] += 1
            else:
                remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If `postorder` is `False`, then `stack` is [(s, True), (u, False), (u, False), (u, False), ..., (u, False)], `good_components` is {s: 0}, `remaining_size` is {s: 1}, and `v` is the root vertex `s`, where `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least `k` children, and `u` is the `k`th child of `v`. If `postorder` is `True`, then `stack` is an empty list, and if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value, the value of `good_components[u]`, and 1, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`. If the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`, then `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and the value of `remaining_size[u]`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If `postorder` is `False`, then the stack has n+1 additional elements (v, True) and (u, False) repeated n times, good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least n children, u is the nth child in the list. If `postorder` is `True`, then the stack is not empty, and good_components and remaining_size have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element (v, postorder) has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] is increased by remaining_size[u].
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *The stack has been updated, and the tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. If the postorder is empty, the top element (v, True) has been removed from the stack, good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, and tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, where n is the number of children of v. If the postorder is not empty, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] is increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack is not empty, and the list of children in tree.vertices[v] is empty.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
