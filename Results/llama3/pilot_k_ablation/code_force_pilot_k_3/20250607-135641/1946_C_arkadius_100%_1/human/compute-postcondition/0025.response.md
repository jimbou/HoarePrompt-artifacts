Postcondition: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by 1 if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`, `v` is the root vertex `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two child vertices, `u` is the second child vertex of `v`, and the value of `good_components[v]` is now the sum of its previous value and 1 if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `good_components[v]` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]` if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`.**
