Output State: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three child vertices, `u` is the third child vertex of `v`, and `good_components[v]` is now the sum of its previous value and the value of `good_components[u]`, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]` if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `good_components[v]` has been updated to include the value of `good_components[u]`, where `u` is the third child vertex of `v`. The remaining size of `v` has also been updated if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
