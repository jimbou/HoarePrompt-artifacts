Functionality: **This function calculates and returns the total number of good components and the total remaining size in the subtree rooted at a given vertex v in a tree data structure. It recursively processes the children of v, counting good components and accumulating remaining sizes. If the remaining size of a subtree is greater than or equal to a given threshold x, it is considered a good component. The function returns the total count of good components and the total remaining size of the subtree rooted at v.**
