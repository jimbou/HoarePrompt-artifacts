Functionality: **The function reads input from the user, constructs a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, and then calls another function (func_4) to perform some operation on the tree. The result of this operation is then printed to the console. The function does not modify the input variables n and k, but it does modify the tree by adding edges to it. The final state of the program is that the tree has been constructed and the result of the operation performed by func_4 has been printed.**
