Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`, `beg` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `end` is either `n` or `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is either `((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2` or `(1 + (n + 2) // 2 - 1 + 1) // 2`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure and the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `beg` is updated to be the same as `mid`, which is the average of `beg` and `end` plus one, divided by two. The value of `end` and `mid` depends on whether `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True or not. If it is True, then `end` is `n` and `mid` is the average of `(n + 2) // 2` and `n` plus one, divided by two. Otherwise, `end` is `(n + 2) // 2 - 1` and `mid` is the average of 1 and `(n + 2) // 2 - 1` plus one, divided by two.
