Postcondition: ***`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, then `beg` is `(n + 2) // 2`, `end` is `n`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `beg` is 1, `end` is `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2`.***
