Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, i is n-1, tree is a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, the tree will have `n` nodes and `n-1` edges, and the standard input (`stdin`) will be empty. The values of `n` and `k` will remain unchanged, with `n` being a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and `k` being a positive integer less than `n` and less than or equal to 10^5.
