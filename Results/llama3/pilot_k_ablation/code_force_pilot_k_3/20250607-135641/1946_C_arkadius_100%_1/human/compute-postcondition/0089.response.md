Postcondition: **The value of good_components[v] has been increased by good_components[u] if remaining_size[u] is less than x, otherwise it has been increased by 1. Additionally, if remaining_size[u] is less than x, the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack, postorder, and the current value of postorder remain unchanged. The list of children in tree.vertices[v] still has at least 2 children, with u being the second child.**
