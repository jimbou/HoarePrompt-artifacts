Postcondition: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If `postorder` is `False`, then the stack has n+1 additional elements (v, True) and (u, False) repeated n times, good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least n children, u is the nth child in the list. If `postorder` is `True`, then the stack is not empty, and good_components and remaining_size have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element (v, postorder) has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] is increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] is increased by remaining_size[u].**
