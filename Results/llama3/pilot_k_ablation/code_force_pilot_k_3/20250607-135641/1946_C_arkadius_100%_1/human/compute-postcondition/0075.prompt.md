Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The stack has been updated with the top element (v, True) added back. The good_components[v] has been reset to 0, and remaining_size[v] has been reset to 1. The relationships and values of tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and the stack remain unchanged, except for the updates to v.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The stack has been updated with the top element (v, True) and the new element (u, False), good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 1 child, u is the first child of v

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The stack has been updated with the top element (v, True), the second top element (u, False), and the new top element (u, False), good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 2 children, u is the second child of v

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The stack has the top element (u, False), the second top element (u, False), the third top element (v, True), good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 3 children, u is the third child of v.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
