Output State: **`tree` is a tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by 1, `remaining_size` is a dictionary where the current value of `u` is greater than or equal to `x` if the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`, `v` is the root vertex `s`, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, and `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least two child vertices, `u` is the second child vertex of `v`, and the value of `good_components[v]` is now the sum of its previous value and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure remains unchanged with `n` vertices and `s` as the root vertex. The minimum size of each connected component is still represented by the positive integer `x`. The stack is still empty. The `good_components` dictionary has been updated, where the value of the root vertex `v` has been incremented by 1. The `remaining_size` dictionary remains unchanged. The root vertex `v` is still `s`, and the `postorder` value is still `True`. The tree's vertex `v` still has at least two child vertices, and `u` is still the second child vertex of `v`. The value of `good_components[v]` has been increased by 1.
