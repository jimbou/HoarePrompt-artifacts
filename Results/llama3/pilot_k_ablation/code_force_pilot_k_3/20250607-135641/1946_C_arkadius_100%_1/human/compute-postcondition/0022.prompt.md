You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: ** Your response here **

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tree is a tree data structure with n vertices, v is a vertex in the tree, and x is a positive integer.
    good_components = 0
    remaining_size = 1
    for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
        good_components_subtree, remaining_size_subtree = func_2(tree, u, x)
        
        good_components += good_components_subtree
        
        if remaining_size_subtree >= x:
            good_components += 1
        else:
            remaining_size += remaining_size_subtree
        
    #State: good_components is increased by the number of good components in the subtrees rooted at all children of v, the state of tree, v, x remains unchanged, tree.vertices[v].children has no more children, u is the last child. If the remaining size of the subtree rooted at u is greater than or equal to x, good_components is increased by one. Otherwise, remaining_size is increased by the remaining size of the subtree rooted at u.
    print(v, good_components, remaining_size)
    #This is printed: v (the vertex whose children have been processed), good_components (the total number of good components in the subtrees rooted at all children of v), remaining_size (the total remaining size of the subtrees rooted at all children of v)
    return good_components, remaining_size
    #The program returns the total number of good components in the subtree rooted at v, including the last child u if its remaining size is greater than or equal to x, and the total remaining size of the subtree rooted at v, which is the sum of the remaining sizes of all children of v, including u if its remaining size is less than x.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the total number of good components in the subtree rooted at v, including the last child u if its remaining size is greater than or equal to x, and the total remaining size of the subtree rooted at v, which is the sum of the remaining sizes of all children of v, including u if its remaining size is less than x.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
