Output State: **The tree data structure with `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `postorder` is `True`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least three child vertices, `u` is the third child vertex of `v`, `good_components[v]` is now the sum of its previous value, the value of `good_components[u]`, and 1, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]` if the remaining size of `u` is less than `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `good_components[v]` has been incremented by 1, in addition to the previous sum of its value and the value of `good_components[u]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
