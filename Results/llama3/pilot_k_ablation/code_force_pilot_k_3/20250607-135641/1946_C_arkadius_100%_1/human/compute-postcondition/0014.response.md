Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, then `beg` is `(n + 2) // 2`, `end` is `n`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2 = ((n + 2) // 2 + n + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `beg` is 1, `end` is `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, `mid` is `(beg + end + 1) // 2 = (1 + (n + 2) // 2 - 1 + 1) // 2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure and the values of `n` and `k` remain the same. The value of `mid` is updated based on the values of `beg` and `end`, which depend on the result of the function `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`. If the function returns True, `mid` is calculated as the average of `(n + 2) // 2` and `n`, plus 1, divided by 2. If the function returns False, `mid` is calculated as the average of 1 and `(n + 2) // 2 - 1`, plus 1, divided by 2.
