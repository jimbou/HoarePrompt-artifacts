Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, n is greater than 1, tree is a tree with n nodes and an additional edge between nodes u-1 and v-1, i is 1, stdin contains n-2 lines of input, each containing two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n) representing the edges of the tree.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The tree, initially with `n` nodes, now has an additional edge between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, which were read from the input. The value of `i` remains 1 as it is not modified by the code. Stdin initially contained `n-1` lines of input, but one line was consumed by the `input()` function, leaving `n-2` lines of input remaining.
