Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, tree is a tree with n nodes, stdin contains n-1 lines of input, each containing two integers v and u (1 <= v, u <= n) representing the edges of the tree.**

The first line of the code assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input. Since `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= k < n <= 10^5, the values of `n` and `k` are updated accordingly. The second line creates a tree with `n` nodes. The tree is initialized with `n` nodes, but no edges are added yet. The next `n-1` lines of input contain two integers `v` and `u` (1 <= v, u <= n) representing the edges of the tree. These edges are not added to the tree in this code snippet, but they are available in the input for future operations.
