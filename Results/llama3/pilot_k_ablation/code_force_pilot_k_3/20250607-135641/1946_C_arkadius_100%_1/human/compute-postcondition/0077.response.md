Postcondition: **The top element (v, postorder) has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] was greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] was increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack is not empty. The postorder is not empty. The current value of postorder is not empty.**
