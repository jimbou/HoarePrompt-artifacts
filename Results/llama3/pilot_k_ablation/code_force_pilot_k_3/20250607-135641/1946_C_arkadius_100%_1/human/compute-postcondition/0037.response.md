According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tree.vertices[v].children. If the tree.vertices[v].children has at least 1 child the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the stack has an additional element (v, True), good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1. So for the loop to be executed  the tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 1 child and u is the first child in the list.
State: **The stack has an additional element (v, True), good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, u is the first child in the list**
