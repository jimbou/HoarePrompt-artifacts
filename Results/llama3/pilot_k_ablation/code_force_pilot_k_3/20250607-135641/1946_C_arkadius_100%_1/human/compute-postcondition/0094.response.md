Postcondition: **The value of good_components[v] has been increased by twice the value of good_components[u] plus 1 if remaining_size[u] is less than x, otherwise it has been increased by 3 if remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x. If remaining_size[u] is less than x, the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u], otherwise it has been increased by twice the value of remaining_size[u]. The stack, postorder, and the current value of postorder remain unchanged. The list of children in tree.vertices[v] still has at least 3 children, with u being the third child.**
