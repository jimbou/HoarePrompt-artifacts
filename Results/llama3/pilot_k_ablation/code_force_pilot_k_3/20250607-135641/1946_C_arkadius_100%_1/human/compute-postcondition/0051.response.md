Output State: **The tree data structure has `n` vertices, `s` is the root vertex of the tree, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. `postorder` is `True`, indicating that the postorder traversal has been performed. The `stack` is not empty, and `good_components` and `remaining_size` have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element `(v, postorder)` has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, and `stack` maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, the current value of `postorder` is `True`, indicating that the postorder traversal has been completed. `v` has at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of `v`, and `good_components[v]` is now equal to its previous value plus `good_components[u]`. The remaining size of `u` is less than `x`. The remaining size of `v` is now equal to the sum of its previous remaining size and the remaining size of `u`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure remains the same with `n` vertices and `s` as the root vertex. The postorder traversal has been performed, and the stack is not empty. The `good_components` and `remaining_size` have been updated according to the postorder traversal rules. The top element `(v, postorder)` has been removed from the stack. The relationships and values of the tree vertices, `good_components`, `remaining_size`, and `stack` remain the same as before. The postorder traversal is complete. `v` has at least one child, and `u` is the first child of `v`. The value of `good_components[v]` is the sum of its previous value and `good_components[u]`. The remaining size of `u` is less than `x`. The remaining size of `v` is now the sum of its previous remaining size and the remaining size of `u`.
