Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The top element (v, postorder) has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] was greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] was increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack is not empty. The postorder is not empty. The current value of postorder is not empty.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *The top element (v, postorder) has been removed from the stack. The tree vertices, good_components, remaining_size, and stack maintain their previous relationships and values as described in the precondition. Additionally, for each child u of v, if remaining_size[u] was greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] was increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] was increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack is not empty. The postorder is not empty. The current value of postorder is not empty. tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, u is the first child in the list. If remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x, then good_components[v] has been increased by good_components[u] plus 1. Otherwise, good_components[v] has been increased by good_components[u], and remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The value of good_components[v] has been increased by good_components[u] if remaining_size[u] is less than x, otherwise it has been increased by 1. Additionally, if remaining_size[u] is less than x, the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u]. The stack, postorder, and the current value of postorder remain unchanged. The list of children in tree.vertices[v] still has at least 2 children, with u being the second child.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The value of good_components[v] has been increased by twice the value of good_components[u] plus 1 if remaining_size[u] is less than x, otherwise it has been increased by 3 if remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x. If remaining_size[u] is less than x, the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u], otherwise it has been increased by twice the value of remaining_size[u]. The stack, postorder, and the current value of postorder remain unchanged. The list of children in tree.vertices[v] still has at least 3 children, with u being the third child.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
