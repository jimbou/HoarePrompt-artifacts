#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() returns a string of space-separated values of the same type that cast can handle.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each space-separated value in the input string, converting them to a specific type that the cast function can handle.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a specified casting function to each value, and returns a map object containing the converted values. The function effectively converts a string of values into a collection of values of a specific type, as determined by the casting function.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2

            l = mid

    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns the index `l` which is equal to `r` and is the index of an element in the list `arr` for which the function `predicate` returns `True`.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `l` equals `r`, and the result of applying the `predicate` function to the element at index `l` of `arr` is false
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list of elements to find the index of an element for which a given predicate function returns True. It takes a list `arr` and a predicate function as input. If such an element is found, the function returns its index. If no such element is found, the function returns None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.

    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is the last element in the list a.

        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:

Either 'Yes' is printed when upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, or 'No' is printed when either upper is less than or equal to lower, or l is greater than upper, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than l, or lower is greater than r.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array 'a' that has a specific XOR property. It takes no arguments but uses external functions 'func_1' and 'func_2' to obtain necessary inputs. The function iterates over a series of queries, each specifying a range [l, r] within the array. For each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has the XOR property. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function repeats this process for all queries, ultimately printing a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses indicating the existence of subarrays with the desired XOR property for each query range.
