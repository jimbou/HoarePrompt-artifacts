Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1` with argument `n`. If the current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`, 'Yes' is printed and the loop iteration is skipped. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
