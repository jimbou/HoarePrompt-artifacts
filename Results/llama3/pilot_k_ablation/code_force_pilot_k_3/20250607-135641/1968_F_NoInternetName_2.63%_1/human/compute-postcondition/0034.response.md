Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 1, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]], if x[l - 1] is equal to x[r], 'Yes' is printed because upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, 'Yes' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.***
