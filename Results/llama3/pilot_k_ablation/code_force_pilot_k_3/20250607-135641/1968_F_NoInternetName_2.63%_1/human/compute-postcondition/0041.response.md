Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 3, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 2, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]], lower and upper are updated based on the results of func_2 and list indexing.**

The code updates the values of `lower` and `upper` based on the results of `func_2` and list indexing. The `func_2` function is applied to the lists `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]` with lambda functions as arguments. The lambda functions filter the elements in the lists based on the conditions `arg < l` and `arg <= r`, respectively. The results of `func_2` are used to index into the lists `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]` to update the values of `lower` and `upper`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
