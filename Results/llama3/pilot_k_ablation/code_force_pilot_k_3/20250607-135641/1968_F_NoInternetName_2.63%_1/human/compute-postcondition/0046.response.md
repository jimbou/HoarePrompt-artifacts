Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 3, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 2, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]], lower and upper are updated based on the results of func_2 and list indexing. If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
