Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1` with argument `n`**

The code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `n`, which is a positive integer. The function returns two values, which are assigned to the variables `l` and `r`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, so the exact values of `l` and `r` cannot be determined. However, it is known that they are returned values from the function `func_1` with argument `n`.
