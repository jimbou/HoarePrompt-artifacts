Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in `x` XOR each element in the list `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list `x` and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list `x`, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1` with argument `n`, `lower` is the value at index `lower + 1` in the list `inds[x[r]]`, `upper` is the value at index `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`, and 'Yes' is printed because `upper` is greater than `lower`, `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. The values of all variables remain the same, but the program flow is affected as it skips the rest of the current iteration.
