To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `q`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 1, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, `i` is 0**
