Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 0, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. Either 'Yes' is printed when upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, or 'No' is printed when either upper is less than or equal to lower, or l is greater than upper, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than l, or lower is greater than r.**
