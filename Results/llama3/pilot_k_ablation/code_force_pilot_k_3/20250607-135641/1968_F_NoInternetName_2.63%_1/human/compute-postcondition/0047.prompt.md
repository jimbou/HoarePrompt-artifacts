Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is the last element in the list a.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
    upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
    lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
    if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 0, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. Either 'Yes' is printed when upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, or 'No' is printed when either upper is less than or equal to lower, or l is greater than upper, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than l, or lower is greater than r.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 1, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]], if x[l - 1] is equal to x[r], 'Yes' is printed because upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, 'Yes' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, q is at least 3, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 2, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]], lower and upper are updated based on the results of func_2 and list indexing. If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
