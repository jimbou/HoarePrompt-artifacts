Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 1, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 0, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code snippet only modifies the values of `lower` and `upper`. 

The `lower` variable is assigned the value at index `lower + 1` in the list `inds[x[r]]`, where `lower` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l)` or `-1`. This means that `lower` now holds the value of the next index in the list `inds[x[r]]` that is greater than `l`.

The `upper` variable is assigned the value at index `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`, where `upper` is the result of `func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)`. This means that `upper` now holds the value of the index in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]` that is less than or equal to `r`.

Note that the code snippet does not modify the values of `x[l - 1]` and `x[r]`, so the condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is not affected by the execution of this code.
