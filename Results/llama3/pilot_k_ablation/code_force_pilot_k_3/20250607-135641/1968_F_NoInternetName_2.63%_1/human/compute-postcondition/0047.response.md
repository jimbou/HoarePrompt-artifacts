Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is q - 1, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. Either 'Yes' is printed when upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, or 'No' is printed when either upper is less than or equal to lower, or l is greater than upper, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than l, or lower is greater than r.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is similar to the previous output states, with the main difference being that the loop has executed q times. The variables n, a, x, inds, and i have the same values as in the previous output states. The variables l and r are the returned values from func_1 with argument n, and lower and upper are the values at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]] and index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]], respectively. The loop prints 'Yes' if upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r. Otherwise, it prints 'No'.
