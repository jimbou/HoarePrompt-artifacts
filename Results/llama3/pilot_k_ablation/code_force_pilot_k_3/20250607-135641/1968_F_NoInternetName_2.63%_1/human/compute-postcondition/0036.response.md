Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 3, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing `len(a)` + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in `x` XOR each element in the list `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list `x` and a list containing `len(a)` + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list `x`, `i` is 2, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1` with argument `n`, `lower` is the value at index `lower` + 1 in the list `inds[x[r]]`, `upper` is the value at index `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`, if `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, 'Yes' is printed because `upper` is greater than `lower`, `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `upper` is greater than `lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, 'Yes' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `l` and `r` have been updated to the returned values from `func_1` with argument `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' and skipping to the next iteration of the loop are still dependent on the values of `x[l - 1]`, `x[r]`, `upper`, `lower`, `l`, and `r`.
