Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is at least 2, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in `x` XOR each element in the list `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list `x` and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list `x`, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1` with argument `n`, `lower` is the value at index `lower + 1` in the list `inds[x[r]]`, `upper` is the value at index `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`. Either 'Yes' is printed when `upper` is greater than `lower`, `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r`, and `l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`, or 'No' is printed when either `upper` is less than or equal to `lower`, or `l` is greater than `upper`, or `upper` is greater than `r`, or `lower` is less than `l`, or `lower` is greater than `r`.**

The code calls the function `func_1` with the argument `n` and assigns the returned values to `l` and `r`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The output state includes the updated values of `l` and `r`, as well as the conditions for printing 'Yes' or 'No' based on the values of `upper`, `lower`, `l`, and `r`.
