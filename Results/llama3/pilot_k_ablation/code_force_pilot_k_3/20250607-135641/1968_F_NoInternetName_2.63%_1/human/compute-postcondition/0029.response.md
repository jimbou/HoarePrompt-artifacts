Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is at least 2, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is 1, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]], if x[l - 1] is equal to x[r], 'Yes' is printed because upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The code only updates the values of `lower` and `upper` based on the results of the `func_2` function calls. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, the code prints 'Yes' and skips to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.
