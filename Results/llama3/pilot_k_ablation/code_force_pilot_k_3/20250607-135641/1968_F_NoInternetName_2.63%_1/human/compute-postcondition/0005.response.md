State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 3 elements, `x` is a list containing four elements: 0, the result of 0 XOR the first element in the list `a`, the result of the last element in `x` XOR the second element in the list `a`, and the result of the last element in `x` XOR the third element in the list `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list `x` and a list containing four elements: 0, the index of the second element in the list `x`, the index of the third element in the list `x`, and the index of the last element in the list `x`, `i` is the third element in the list `a`**
