This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array 'a' that has a specific XOR property. It takes no arguments but uses external functions 'func_1' and 'func_2' to obtain necessary inputs. The function iterates over a series of queries, each specifying a range [l, r] within the array. For each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has the XOR property. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function repeats this process for all queries, ultimately printing a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses indicating the existence of subarrays with the desired XOR property for each query range.
