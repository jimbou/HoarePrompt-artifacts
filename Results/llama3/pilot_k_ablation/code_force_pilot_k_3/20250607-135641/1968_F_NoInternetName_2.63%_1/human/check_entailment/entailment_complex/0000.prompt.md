Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Let us call an array x_1,\dots,x_m interesting if it is possible to divide the
array into k>1 parts so that [bitwise XOR](http://tiny.cc/xor_wiki_eng) of
values from each part are equal.

More formally, you must split array x into k consecutive segments, each
element of x must belong to exactly 1 segment. Let y_1,\dots,y_k be the XOR of
elements from each part respectively. Then y_1=y_2=\dots=y_k must be
fulfilled.

For example, if x = [1, 1, 2, 3, 0] , you can split it as follows:
[\color{blue}1], [\color{green}1], [\color{red}2, \color{red}3, \color{red}0]
. Indeed \color{blue}1=\color{green}1=\color{red}2 \oplus \color{red}3\oplus
\color{red}0 .

You are given an array a_1,\dots,a_n . Your task is to answer q queries:

  * For fixed l , r , determine whether the subarray a_l,a_{l+1},\dots,a_r is interesting. 

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1\le t\le 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (2 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of elements in the array
and the number of queries respectively.

The next line contains n integers a_1,\dots,a_n (0 \le a_i < 2^{30} ) —
elements of the array.

Each of the next q lines contains two integers l and r (1 \le l < r \le n )
describing the query.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

It is guaranteed that the sum of q over all testcases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each query, output "YES" if the subarray is interesting and "NO"
otherwise.

You can output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES",
"yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as correct answers).

Note

Explanation for the first test case:

The first query is described in the statement.

In the second query, we should divide [1,2,3] . A possible division is
[1,2],[3] , since 1\oplus 2=3 .

It can be shown that for queries 3,4,5 , the subarrays are not interesting.

# Annotated Functions:
from collections import defaultdict

if __name__ == '__main__':
    (t,) = func_1(int)
    for _ in range(t):
        func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() returns a string of space-separated values of the same type that cast can handle.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each space-separated value in the input string, converting them to a specific type that the cast function can handle.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a specified casting function to each value, and returns a map object containing the converted values. The function effectively converts a string of values into a collection of values of a specific type, as determined by the casting function.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.
    l, r = 0, len(arr)
    while l + 1 < r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        
        if predicate(arr[mid]):
            l = mid
        else:
            r = mid
        
    #State: `arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `l` equals `r`.
    if predicate(arr[l]) :
        return l
        #The program returns the index `l` which is equal to `r` and is the index of an element in the list `arr` for which the function `predicate` returns `True`.
    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `l` equals `r`, and the result of applying the `predicate` function to the element at index `l` of `arr` is false
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list of elements to find the index of an element for which a given predicate function returns True. It takes a list `arr` and a predicate function as input. If such an element is found, the function returns its index. If no such element is found, the function returns None.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, l and r are positive integers such that 1 <= l < r <= n.
    n, q = func_1(int)
    a = list(func_1(int))
    x = [0]
    inds = defaultdict(list)
    inds[0].append(0)
    for i in a:
        x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
        
        inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is the last element in the list a.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)
        
        if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
            print('Yes')
            continue
        
        lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
        
        upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
        
        lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
        
        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
            print('Yes')
        else:
            print('No')
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the result of the last element in x XOR each element in the list a, inds is a dictionary with a single key which is the last element in the list x and a list containing len(a) + 1 elements: 0 and the index of each element in the list x, i is q - 1, l and r are returned values from func_1 with argument n, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. Either 'Yes' is printed when upper is greater than lower, l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r, and l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r, or 'No' is printed when either upper is less than or equal to lower, or l is greater than upper, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than l, or lower is greater than r.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array 'a' that has a specific XOR property. It takes no arguments but uses external functions 'func_1' and 'func_2' to obtain necessary inputs. The function iterates over a series of queries, each specifying a range [l, r] within the array. For each query, it checks if there exists a subarray within the specified range that has the XOR property. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function repeats this process for all queries, ultimately printing a series of 'Yes' or 'No' responses indicating the existence of subarrays with the desired XOR property for each query range.
