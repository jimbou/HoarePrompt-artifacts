Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray within a given array has a specific XOR property. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`, which work together to achieve this goal.

`func_1` is used to read input values and convert them to a specified type. `func_2` performs a binary search on a list of elements to find the index of an element that satisfies a given predicate function. `func_3` is the main function that determines whether a subarray within a given array has the XOR property.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. Read the number of test cases `t` using `func_1`.
2. For each test case, read the number of elements `n` and the number of queries `q` using `func_1`.
3. Read the array `a` using `func_1`.
4. Calculate the XOR of each prefix of the array and store it in the list `x`.
5. Create a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of each XOR value.
6. For each query, read the range `[l, r]` using `func_1`.
7. Check if the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]` is equal to the XOR of the entire array. If it is, print "Yes" and continue.
8. Otherwise, use `func_2` to find the indices of the XOR values that match the XOR of the subarray `[l, r]`.
9. Check if there exists a subarray within the range `[l, r]` that has the XOR property. If it does, print "Yes"; otherwise, print "No".

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
