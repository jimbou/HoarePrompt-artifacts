Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine whether a subarray is interesting or not based on the XOR of its elements. It uses a dictionary to store the indices of the XOR values, which allows it to efficiently find the lower and upper bounds for the subarray. The program then checks if the upper bound is greater than the lower bound and if the subarray is within the bounds, and prints 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
