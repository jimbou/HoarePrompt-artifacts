Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty by counting the number of negative signs in the string and then calculating the absolute difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of negative signs. This is because the optimal way to split the array is to group all the negative signs together, which will result in a penalty equal to the absolute difference between the total length of the string and twice the number of negative signs.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the string consists only of positive signs (in which case the penalty is 0), the case where the string consists only of negative signs (in which case the penalty is equal to the length of the string), and all other cases where the string contains a mix of positive and negative signs.

The program also correctly handles the case where the length of the string is equal to the number of negative signs, in which case the penalty is equal to the length of the string.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
