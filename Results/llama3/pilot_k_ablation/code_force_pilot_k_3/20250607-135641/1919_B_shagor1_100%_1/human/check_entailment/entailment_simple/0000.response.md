Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum possible penalty that can be received by splitting an array into non-empty subarrays and calculating the penalty for each subarray. The penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length.

The given program calculates the number of '-' characters in the input string `s` and stores it in the variable `neg`. Then, it prints the absolute difference between the length of the string `n` and twice the number of '-' characters `neg`. If `n` is equal to `neg`, it prints `n`.

The reasoning behind this is that the optimal way to split the array is to group all the '+' characters together and all the '-' characters together. This is because the penalty for a subarray is the absolute value of its sum multiplied by its length, so grouping all the '+' characters together will result in a subarray with a sum of `n - neg` and a length of `n - neg`, and grouping all the '-' characters together will result in a subarray with a sum of `-neg` and a length of `neg`. The total penalty will be the sum of these two penalties, which is `abs(n - 2 * neg)`.

However, if `n` is equal to `neg`, it means that the input string `s` consists of only '-' characters. In this case, the optimal way to split the array is to group each '-' character separately, resulting in a total penalty of `n`.

Therefore, the given program correctly calculates the minimum possible penalty that can be received.

Correctness: **True**
