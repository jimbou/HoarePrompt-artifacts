Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input values `n` and `s` from the standard input.
2. It initializes a variable `neg` to count the number of '-' characters in the string `s`.
3. It iterates through the string `s` and increments `neg` for each '-' character found.
4. After counting the '-' characters, it calculates the absolute difference between `n` (the length of the string) and twice the number of '-' characters (`2 * neg`). This is because each '-' character contributes -1 to the sum, and each '+' character contributes +1. The absolute difference represents the minimum possible penalty.
5. If the number of '-' characters is equal to `n`, it simply prints `n`, which is the correct penalty in this case (since all characters are '-' and the sum is -n).
6. The program prints the calculated penalty.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the edge case where the number of '-' characters is equal to `n`. The output matches the expected output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
