The code increments the value of `neg` by 1. The initial value of `neg` is 0, so after the increment, `neg` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must not be empty, `neg` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, and the first character `i` of the string `s` is '-'**
