Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `neg` is either 2 or unchanged + 1 (depending on the first character of `s`), `i` is the second character in the string `s`**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or its previous value plus 1, depending on the first character of the string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
