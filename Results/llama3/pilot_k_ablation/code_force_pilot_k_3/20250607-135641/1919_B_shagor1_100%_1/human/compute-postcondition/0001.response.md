According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters, `neg` is 0, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `s` is not empty and `i` is the first character in the string `s`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must not be empty, `neg` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the first character in the string `s`**
