Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is an empty string, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, neg is equal to the number of '-' characters in the initial string s.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the string `s` is empty, the number of test cases in `stdin` remains unchanged, and the variable `neg` now holds the total count of '-' characters that were present in the initial string `s`. The value of `n` remains the same as it was before the loop started.
