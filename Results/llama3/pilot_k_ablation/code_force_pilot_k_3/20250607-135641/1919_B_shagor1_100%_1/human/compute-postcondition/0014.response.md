Functionality: **The function reads two inputs from the standard input: an integer n and a string s of length n consisting of "+" and "-" characters. It then calculates the absolute difference between n and twice the number of "-" characters in the string, and prints this value. If the number of "-" characters is equal to n, it simply prints n. The function does not modify the input variables and does not return any value, only printing the calculated result.**
