Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the second character in the string `s`. If `i` is '-', `neg` is either 3 or unchanged + 2 (depending on the first character of `s`). Otherwise, `neg` is either 2 or unchanged + 1 (depending on the first character of `s`).***
