Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. If the second character `i` in the string `s` is '-', then `neg` is either 2 or unchanged + 1 (depending on the first character of `s`).***
