To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `s`. The loop will execute again if there are more characters in the string `s` to iterate over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 2 characters. This means that `s` has at least one more character to iterate over.

Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on the value of the next character in the string `s`. Therefore, `i` will be the second character in the string `s`.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not a variable in the loop head.

The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, as it is not a variable in the loop head.

The state of `neg` is not directly affected by the loop, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, `neg` is either 2 or unchanged + 1 (depending on the first character of `s`)**
