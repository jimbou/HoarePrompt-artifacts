Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of "+" and "-" characters that must have at least 1 character, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is the second character in the string `s`, `neg` is either 3 or unchanged + 2 (depending on the first character of `s`).**

In this output state, the value of `neg` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `neg` is now either 3 (if the first character of `s` was "+") or unchanged + 2 (if the first character of `s` was "-").
