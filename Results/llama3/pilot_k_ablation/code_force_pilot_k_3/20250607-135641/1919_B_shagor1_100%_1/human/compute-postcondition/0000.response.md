Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, s is a string of length n consisting of "+" and "-" characters, neg is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

The code reads an integer n from stdin, which can be any value between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and assigns it to the variable n. Then, it reads a string s of length n from stdin, consisting of "+" and "-" characters, and assigns it to the variable s. The variable neg is initialized to 0. After executing this code, stdin will contain one less test case.
