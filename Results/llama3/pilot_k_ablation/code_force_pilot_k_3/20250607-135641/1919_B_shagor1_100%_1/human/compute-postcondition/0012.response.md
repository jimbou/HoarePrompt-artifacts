To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the initial state and the code:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive.
   - `s` is an empty string.
   - `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one. (This information is not directly relevant to the print statement but indicates the context of the program.)
   - `neg` is equal to the number of '-' characters in the initial string `s`. Since `s` is an empty string, `neg` is 0.

2. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code prints the result of the expression `abs(n - 2 * neg)` if the condition `n != neg` is true. Otherwise, it prints `n`.
   - Given that `neg` is 0 (because `s` is an empty string), the condition `n != neg` will always be true for any `n` other than 0. Since `n` is between 1 and 5000 inclusive, this condition will always hold true.
   - Therefore, the expression `abs(n - 2 * neg)` simplifies to `abs(n - 2 * 0)`, which further simplifies to `abs(n)`.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive, and the absolute value of any positive number is the number itself, the code will print the value of `n`.

Output: **n (where n is an integer between 1 and 5000 inclusive)**
