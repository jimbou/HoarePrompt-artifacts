Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The program constructs a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even, by alternating between assigning the smallest and largest remaining values to the permutation array in a specific pattern.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input values n and k, constructs the permutation array, and prints the result. `func_2` reads the number of test cases t and calls `func_1` for each test case.

The logic of the program is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The program ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1, which is the defining property of a k-level permutation.

The program's approach of alternating between assigning the smallest and largest remaining values to the permutation array is a valid and efficient way to construct a k-level permutation. The use of two pointers, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to keep track of the smallest and largest remaining values, respectively, is a clever technique that simplifies the construction process.

Overall, the program is well-structured, efficient, and correct. It meets all the requirements of the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible input cases.
