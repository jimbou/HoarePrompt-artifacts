Reasoning: 

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

Function `func_1` generates a permutation of n integers based on the input parameters n and k. It constructs the permutation by iterating k times, assigning values to the permutation list in a specific pattern. The pattern alternates between assigning values from the bottom (starting from 1) and top (starting from n) of the range, incrementing or decrementing the values accordingly.

Function `func_2` reads an integer from standard input, repeatedly calls `func_1` a number of times equal to the input integer, and then terminates when the input integer reaches 0, leaving the standard input empty.

Based on the execution summaries, it appears that `func_1` correctly generates a k-level permutation of length n, and `func_2` correctly reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
