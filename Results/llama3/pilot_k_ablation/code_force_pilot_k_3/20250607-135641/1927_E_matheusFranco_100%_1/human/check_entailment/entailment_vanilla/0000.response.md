Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of constructing a k-level permutation of length n. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` takes the input values n and k, constructs the permutation, and prints the result. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. `func_1` reads the input values n and k and initializes an array `permutation` of size n with all elements set to 0.

2. It then initializes two variables, `bottom_v` and `top_v`, to 1 and n, respectively. These variables will be used to fill the permutation array.

3. The program then enters a while loop that runs k times. In each iteration, it calculates the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` which is a multiple of k plus the current index `idx`.

4. Inside the while loop, it checks if the current index `idx` is even or odd. If it's even, it assigns the value of `bottom_v` to the permutation array at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and increments `bottom_v`. If it's odd, it assigns the value of `top_v` to the permutation array at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and decrements `top_v`.

5. The program then increments `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by k and repeats the process until it has filled the entire permutation array.

6. Finally, it converts the permutation array into a string with spaces in between and prints the result.

7. `func_2` reads the number of test cases, calls `func_1` for each test case, and decrements the test case count until it reaches 0.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the desired output for the given problem. The use of `bottom_v` and `top_v` to fill the permutation array ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1, which is the condition for a k-level permutation.

Correctness: **True**
