To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of `permutation`. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, so we need to adjust the length of `permutation` to be greater than the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1 if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n-1` if `idx` is not divisible by 2, and the length of `permutation` is greater than the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `bottom_v` is 2 if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `bottom_v` is 1. `top_v` is `n` if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `top_v` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty.**
