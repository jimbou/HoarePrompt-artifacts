Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), permutation is a list of n zeros, bottom_v is 1, top_v is n, idx is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while idx < k:
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx = idx
    while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
        if idx % 2 == 0:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
            bottom_v += 1
        else:
            permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
            top_v -= 1
        multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k
    idx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n-1 if idx is not divisible by 2, and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the current value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx. If idx is divisible by 2, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n, bottom_v is n+1, and top_v is n. If idx is not divisible by 2, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is 1, bottom_v is n, and top_v is 1. stdin is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - (number of iterations of the loop) and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
