Postcondition: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than the final value of idx + 2k + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k + 1. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 3 if idx % 2 == 0, otherwise bottom_v is incremented by 2. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even and idx % 2 == 0, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v. If idx is even and idx % 2 == 0, bottom_v is incremented by 2, otherwise top_v is decreased by 1.**
