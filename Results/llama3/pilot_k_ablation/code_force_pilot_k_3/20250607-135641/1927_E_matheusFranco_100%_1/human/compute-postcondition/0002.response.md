Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calls a function named `func_1()`, but since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine its exact effect on the program state. However, we can assume that it does not modify the value of `t` or the contents of stdin.

The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is initially an integer greater than 0, after the decrement, `t` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0.

The state of stdin remains unchanged, as there is no input operation performed in the code snippet.

Therefore, the final output state is that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and stdin contains no input.
