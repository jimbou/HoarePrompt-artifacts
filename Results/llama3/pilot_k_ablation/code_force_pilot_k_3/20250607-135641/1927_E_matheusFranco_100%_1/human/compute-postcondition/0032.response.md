Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers where the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx is bottom_v, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k, and bottom_v is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `permutation` at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `bottom_v`. The length of `permutation` remains greater than the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The value of `bottom_v` has been incremented by 1. All other variables, including `idx`, `k`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, retain their original values and relationships.
