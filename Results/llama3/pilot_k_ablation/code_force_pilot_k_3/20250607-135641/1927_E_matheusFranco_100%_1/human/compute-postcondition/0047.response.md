Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx, and the current value of idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 2**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been increased by 1, making it an odd number. The list `permutation` remains unchanged in terms of its length, but the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is equal to the original value of `idx`) has been updated to `bottom_v`. The value of `bottom_v` has been incremented by 2, as it was incremented by 1 in the second line of the code. All other variables, including `k` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
