Postcondition: ***`idx` is increased by 1, `permutation` is a list of n integers, the length of `permutation` is greater than or equal to the final value of `idx + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than the final value of `idx + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, and `idx` is odd, the value at index `idx` in `permutation` is `top_v - 1` and `top_v` is decreased by 1***
