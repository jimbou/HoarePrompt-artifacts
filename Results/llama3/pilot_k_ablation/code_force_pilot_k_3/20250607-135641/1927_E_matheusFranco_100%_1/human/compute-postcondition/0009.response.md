Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, stdin is empty. If `idx` is divisible by 2, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1, `bottom_v` is 2, and `top_v` is `n`. Otherwise, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v`, `bottom_v` is 1, and `top_v` is `n-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been increased by `k`, which is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions for `permutation`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v` still depend on whether `idx` is divisible by 2.
