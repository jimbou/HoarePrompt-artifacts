Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - (number of iterations of the loop) and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is: idx is increased by 1, and all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of idx is now odd or even, and the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is either bottom_v or top_v - (number of iterations of the loop), depending on whether idx is even or odd.
