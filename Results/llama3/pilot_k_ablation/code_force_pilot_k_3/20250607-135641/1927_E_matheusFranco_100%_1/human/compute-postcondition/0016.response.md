Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n-1 if idx is not divisible by 2, and the length of permutation is greater than the current value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is 3 if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise bottom_v is 2, top_v is n if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise top_v is n-1, stdin is empty.**

The code modifies the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] to be equal to bottom_v. Since bottom_v is 2 if idx is divisible by 2, and 1 if idx is not divisible by 2, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] becomes 2 if idx is divisible by 2, and 1 if idx is not divisible by 2. The second line increments bottom_v by 1, making it 3 if idx is divisible by 2, and 2 if idx is not divisible by 2. No other variables are affected.
