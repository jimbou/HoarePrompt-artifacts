Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers where the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx is top_v, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k, and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In this final state, the value of `permutation` at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `top_v`, and `top_v` has been decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
