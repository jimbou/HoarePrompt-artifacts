To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition in the `while` loop statement, which is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`. This means we need to focus on adjusting the states of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)` to guarantee the loop can proceed.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `idx` is increased by 1
- `permutation` is a list of n integers
- The length of `permutation` is strictly greater than the current value of `idx`
- `stdin` is empty
- `k` is greater than the current value of `idx`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k`

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to make sure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k` and `k` is greater than the current value of `idx`, we need to ensure that `idx + k` is still less than `len(permutation)`.

Given that `idx` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than the current value of `idx`, we can infer that `idx + k` will also increase. However, we are not given the exact values of `idx`, `k`, or `len(permutation)`, so we cannot directly adjust these values.

However, we can infer that for the loop to execute again, `len(permutation)` must be greater than the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, which is `idx + k` after `idx` is increased by 1.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the relationship between `len(permutation)` and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Specifically, `len(permutation)` must be greater than the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.

State: **`idx` is increased by 1, `permutation` is a list of n integers, `len(permutation)` must be greater than the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than the current value of `idx`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + k`**
