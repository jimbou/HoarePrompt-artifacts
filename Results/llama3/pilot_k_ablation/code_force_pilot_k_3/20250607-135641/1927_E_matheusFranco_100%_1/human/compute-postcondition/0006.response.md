Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's implementation is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the state. The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1.

Initially, `t` is greater than 0. After the second line executes, `t` will be either greater than 0 (if `func_1()` did not modify `t`) or less than or equal to 0 (if `func_1()` modified `t` in a way that made it 1 or less). Since we cannot determine the exact effect of `func_1()`, we can only conclude that `t` will be greater than or equal to 0 after the code block executes.
