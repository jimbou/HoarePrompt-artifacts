Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise permutation[idx] is n-1 if idx is not divisible by 2, and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the current value of idx. If idx is divisible by 2, permutation[idx] is n, bottom_v is n+1, and top_v is n. If idx is not divisible by 2, permutation[idx] is 1, bottom_v is n, and top_v is 1. stdin is empty, and k must be greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to be equal to `idx`. The other variables remain unchanged, but their values are still dependent on whether `idx` is divisible by 2 or not. The length of the permutation list is still greater than or equal to the current value of `idx`, and `k` is still greater than the current value of `idx`.
