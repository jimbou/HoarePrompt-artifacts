Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than the final value of idx + 2k + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k + 1. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 3. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v, and bottom_v is incremented by 2 if idx is even, otherwise top_v is decreased by 1.**

The code first assigns the value of `bottom_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`, which means that the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` in the permutation list is now equal to `bottom_v`. Then, it increments `bottom_v` by 1. 

Since `idx` is increased by 1, its parity (even or odd) may change. If `idx` is even, the value at index `idx` in permutation is `bottom_v` and `bottom_v` is incremented by 3 (2 from the initial state and 1 from the code). If `idx` is odd, the value at index `idx` in permutation is `top_v - 1` and `top_v` is decreased by 1. 

The value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is equal to `bottom_v` if `idx` is even, otherwise it is equal to `top_v`. 

The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 2 if `idx` is even (1 from the initial state and 1 from the code), otherwise `top_v` is decreased by 1. 

All other variables remain unchanged.
