Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx, and idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v - 1, and top_v is decreased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is updated to `top_v - 1`, and `top_v` is decreased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value at index `idx` in `permutation` is still `top_v - 1`, and `top_v` is decreased by 1. The length of `permutation` is still greater than or equal to the final value of `idx + 1`, and `stdin` is still empty. The value of `k` is still greater than the final value of `idx + 1`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still equal to `idx`. The value of `idx` is still odd.
