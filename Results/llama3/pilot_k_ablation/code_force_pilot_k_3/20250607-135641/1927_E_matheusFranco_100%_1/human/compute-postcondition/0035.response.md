Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been increased by `k`, which means it is now equal to `idx + 2k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the parity of `idx` and the values at specific indices in the `permutation` list still hold.
