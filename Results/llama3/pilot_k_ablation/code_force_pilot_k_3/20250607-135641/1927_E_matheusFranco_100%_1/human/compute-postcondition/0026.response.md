Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1, the length of permutation is strictly greater than the current value of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx. The current value of idx is odd. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, and bottom_v is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `idx` has been increased by 1, making it an odd number. The list `permutation` remains the same except for the element at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, which is now assigned the value of `bottom_v`. The value of `bottom_v` has been incremented by 1. All other variables, including `k` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
