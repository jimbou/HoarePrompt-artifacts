Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx, and if idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1, if idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1.
Code of the loop:
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    if idx % 2 == 0:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
        bottom_v += 1
    else:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
        top_v -= 1
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 2. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v - 1, and top_v is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + k + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 2. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v, and bottom_v is incremented by 1 if idx is even, otherwise top_v is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than the final value of idx + 2k + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 3k + 1. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 3 if idx % 2 == 0, otherwise bottom_v is incremented by 2. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even and idx % 2 == 0, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v. If idx is even and idx % 2 == 0, bottom_v is incremented by 2, otherwise top_v is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
