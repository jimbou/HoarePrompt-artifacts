Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 2. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v - 1, and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `idx + k`, which is the result of adding `k` to the previous value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the parity of `idx` and the values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` are still valid.
