The variables in the loop head are multiples_of_k_plus_idx and permutation, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables multiples_of_k_plus_idx and permutation. If multiples_of_k_plus_idx is less than len(permutation), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. len(permutation) being greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.**
