Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1 if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n-1` if `idx` is not divisible by 2, and the length of `permutation` is greater than the current value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. If `idx` is divisible by 2, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 3, `bottom_v` is 3, and `top_v` is `n`. If `idx` is not divisible by 2, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n-1`, `bottom_v` is 2, and `top_v` is `n-1`. stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been increased by `k`, which is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive). The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still greater than 0, `permutation` still a list of `n` integers with specific values based on the divisibility of `idx` by 2, and `bottom_v` and `top_v` still having specific values based on the divisibility of `idx` by 2. The stdin remains empty.
