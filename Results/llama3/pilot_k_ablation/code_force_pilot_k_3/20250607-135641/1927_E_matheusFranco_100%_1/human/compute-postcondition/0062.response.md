Output State: **idx is increased by the number of iterations of the loop, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the idx variable has been increased by the number of iterations of the loop, the permutation list remains unchanged, the length of permutation is still greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin remains empty, k is still greater than the final value of idx + 1, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx plus the number of iterations of the loop times k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v has been decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. The value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise it is equal to top_v.
