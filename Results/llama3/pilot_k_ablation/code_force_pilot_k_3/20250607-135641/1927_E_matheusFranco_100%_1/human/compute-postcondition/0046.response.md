Postcondition: ***`idx` is increased by 1, `permutation` is a list of n integers, the length of `permutation` is greater than or equal to the final value of `idx + 1`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than the final value of `idx + 1`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, and the current value of `idx` is even, the value at index `idx` in `permutation` is `bottom_v` and `bottom_v` is incremented by 1***
