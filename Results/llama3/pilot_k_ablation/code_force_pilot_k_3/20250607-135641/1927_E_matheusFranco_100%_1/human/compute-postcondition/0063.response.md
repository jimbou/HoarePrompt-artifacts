Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v.**

In natural language, the output state is: idx has been incremented by 1. The permutation list remains the same, but its length is still greater than or equal to the new value of idx plus 1. The stdin remains empty. k is still greater than the new value of idx plus 1. The value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx has been updated to be equal to the new value of idx plus the number of iterations of the loop times k. The values at index idx in permutation and permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] have been updated based on whether idx is even or odd. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v, and bottom_v has been incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1, and top_v has been decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise it is equal to top_v.
