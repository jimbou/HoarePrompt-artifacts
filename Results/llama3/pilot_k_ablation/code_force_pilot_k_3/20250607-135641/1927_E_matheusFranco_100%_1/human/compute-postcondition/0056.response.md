Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + k + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 2. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to bottom_v if idx is even, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v, and bottom_v is incremented by 1 if idx is even, otherwise top_v is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been increased by `k`. The rest of the variables remain the same as in the initial state, with `idx` still being increased by 1, `permutation` being a list of `n` integers, `k` being greater than the final value of `idx + 1`, and `stdin` being empty. The relationship between `idx`, `bottom_v`, `top_v`, and `permutation` remains the same, with the value at index `idx` in `permutation` being `bottom_v` if `idx` is even and `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now equal to `idx + 2k`.
