Postcondition: **`idx` is increased by 1, `permutation` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1, the length of `permutation` is strictly greater than the current value of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` must be greater than the current value of `idx`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`. The current value of `idx` is even.**
