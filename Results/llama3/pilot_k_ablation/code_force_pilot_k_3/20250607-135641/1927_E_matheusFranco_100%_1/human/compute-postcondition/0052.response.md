The variable in the loop head is multiples_of_k_plus_idx and len(permutation), so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable multiples_of_k_plus_idx and len(permutation). If multiples_of_k_plus_idx is less than len(permutation), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k and len(permutation) is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1. len(permutation) being greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to len(permutation) is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + k + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + k + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k. If idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 2. If idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is equal to top_v - 1, and top_v is decreased by 1.**
