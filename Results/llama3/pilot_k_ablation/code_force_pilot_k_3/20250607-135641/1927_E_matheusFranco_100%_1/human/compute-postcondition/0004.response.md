Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line calls a function named `func_1()`, but since the function definition is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1.

Since `t` is initially greater than 0, after the second line executes, `t` will be either greater than 0 (if `func_1()` does not modify `t`) or equal to 0 (if `func_1()` modifies `t` in a way that makes it 1 before the decrement). Therefore, the final state of `t` is greater than or equal to 0.

Note that the state of `stdin` remains unchanged since there are no input operations in the code snippet.
