Output State: **n is greater than 0, k is an even integer between 2 and n (inclusive), permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n-1, bottom_v is 1 if idx is not divisible by 2, otherwise bottom_v is 2, top_v is n-1, stdin is empty**
