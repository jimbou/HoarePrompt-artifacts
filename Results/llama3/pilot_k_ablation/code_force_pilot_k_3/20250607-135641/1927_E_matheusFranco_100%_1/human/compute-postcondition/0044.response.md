Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx, and if idx is even, the value at index idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1, if idx is odd, the value at index idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is updated to be equal to the final value of `idx`, which is `idx` increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of the permutation is still greater than or equal to the final value of `idx + 1`, and `k` is still greater than the final value of `idx + 1`. The value at index `idx` in the permutation is updated based on whether `idx` is even or odd, and the values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` are updated accordingly.
