Output State: **idx is equal to k, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than or equal to the final value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - (number of iterations of the loop) and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of idx is equal to k.
- The permutation list contains n integers.
- The length of the permutation list is greater than or equal to the final value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx.
- The stdin remains empty.
- The value of k is greater than or equal to the final value of idx.
- The value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx plus the number of iterations of the loop times k.
- If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in the permutation list is equal to bottom_v, and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop.
- If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in the permutation list is equal to top_v minus the number of iterations of the loop, and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop.
