Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise permutation[idx] is n-1 if idx is not divisible by 2, and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the current value of idx. If idx is divisible by 2, permutation[idx] is n, bottom_v is n+1, and top_v is n. If idx is not divisible by 2, permutation[idx] is 1, bottom_v is n, and top_v is 1. stdin is empty, and k must be greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx.
Code of the loop:
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    if idx % 2 == 0:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
        bottom_v += 1
    else:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
        top_v -= 1
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is strictly greater than the current value of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k. If idx is divisible by 2, the first element of permutation is 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is not divisible by 2, permutation[idx] is n-1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, and top_v is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 3k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
