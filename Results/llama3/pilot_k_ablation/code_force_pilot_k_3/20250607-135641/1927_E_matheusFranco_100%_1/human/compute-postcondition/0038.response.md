Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of idx has been increased by 1. The length of the permutation list is still greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1. Stdin remains empty. The value of k is still greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. 

The value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation has been updated to top_v - 1. If idx is even, bottom_v has been incremented by 1. If idx is odd, top_v has been decreased by 1.
