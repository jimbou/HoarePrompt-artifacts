Postcondition: ***idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, len(permutation) is greater than the new value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - 1 and top_v is decreased by 1.***
