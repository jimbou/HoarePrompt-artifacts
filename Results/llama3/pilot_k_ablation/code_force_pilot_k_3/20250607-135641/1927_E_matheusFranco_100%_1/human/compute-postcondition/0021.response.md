Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 if idx is divisible by 2, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n-1 if idx is not divisible by 2, and the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the current value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx. If idx is divisible by 2, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n, bottom_v is n+1, and top_v is n. If idx is not divisible by 2, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is 1, bottom_v is n, and top_v is 1. stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of idx has been incremented by 1. The properties of the permutation list and the values of bottom_v and top_v remain the same as in the initial state, but now they are based on the new value of idx. The stdin remains empty.
