Output State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is strictly greater than the current value of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than the current value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k. If idx is divisible by 2, the first element of permutation is 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is not divisible by 2, permutation[idx] is n-1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, and top_v is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `idx + k`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the parity of `idx` and the values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v` are still applicable, but with the updated value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`.
