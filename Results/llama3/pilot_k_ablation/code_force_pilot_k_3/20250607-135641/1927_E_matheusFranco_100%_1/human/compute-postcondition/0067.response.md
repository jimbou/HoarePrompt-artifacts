Output: **idx is equal to k, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than or equal to the final value of idx, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - (number of iterations of the loop) and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop. result is a string that is a space-separated list of the values in permutation, and this string is printed**
