Functionality: **This function generates a permutation of n integers based on the input parameters n and k, where k is even and 2 <= k <= n <= 2 * 10^5. It constructs the permutation by iterating k times, assigning values to the permutation list in a specific pattern. The pattern alternates between assigning values from the bottom (starting from 1) and top (starting from n) of the range, incrementing or decrementing the values accordingly. The function then prints the resulting permutation as a space-separated list of n integers.**
