To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the loop condition: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`. This means we need to focus on adjusting the states of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)` if necessary.

Given the initial states:
- `idx` is increased by 1
- `permutation` is a list of n integers with specific conditions based on `idx`
- `stdin` is empty
- `k` must be greater than the current value of `idx`
- `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`

The loop condition depends on `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` being less than `len(permutation)`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, and `idx` has been increased by 1, we need to ensure that `len(permutation)` is greater than the current value of `idx` (and thus greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`) for the loop to execute at least once.

Given that the length of `permutation` is greater than or equal to the current value of `idx`, we need to adjust this state to ensure the length of `permutation` is strictly greater than `idx` (and thus `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`) to guarantee the loop can execute.

State: **`idx` is increased by 1, `permutation` is a list of n integers where the first element is 1 if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `permutation[idx]` is n-1 if `idx` is not divisible by 2, and the length of `permutation` is strictly greater than the current value of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` must be greater than the current value of `idx`, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`.**
