Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `k` is an even integer between 2 and `n` (inclusive), `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` integers where the first element is 1 if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n-1` if `idx` is not divisible by 2. `bottom_v` is 2 if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `bottom_v` is 1. `top_v` is `n` if `idx` is divisible by 2, otherwise `top_v` is `n-1`, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been increased by `k`. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the stdin remains empty.
