The only variable in the loop head is variable idx, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable idx. If idx is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, idx is increased by 1, k is greater than the final value of idx. k being greater than the final value of idx does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to k is greater than the final value of idx + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **idx is increased by 1, permutation is a list of n integers, the length of permutation is greater than or equal to the final value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx + 1, stdin is empty, k is greater than the final value of idx + 1, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to the final value of idx + 1 + (number of iterations of the loop) * k. If idx is even, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by the number of iterations of the loop. If idx is odd, the value at index multiples_of_k_plus_idx in permutation is top_v - (number of iterations of the loop) and top_v is decreased by the number of iterations of the loop.**
