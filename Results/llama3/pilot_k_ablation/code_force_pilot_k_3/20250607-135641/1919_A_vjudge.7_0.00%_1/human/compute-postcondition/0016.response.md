Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers. If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' is printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_rep` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the new integers read from the input. The stdin now contains `t-3` lines of input, each containing two integers, because one line of input has been consumed by the `input()` function. The conditions for printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' are still valid, but the actual values of `n` and `k` have changed.
