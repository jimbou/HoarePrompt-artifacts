The only variable in the loop head is variable `_rep` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive) and stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `_rep` is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), `_rep` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0**
