Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is `t-1`, stdin contains no lines of input. If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' is printed `t-1` times. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is printed `t-1` times. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is printed `t-1` times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `_rep` will be equal to `t-1`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The stdin will be empty, as all input lines would have been processed. The output will depend on the comparison between `n` and `k`. If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' will be printed `t-1` times. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' will be printed `t-1` times. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' will be printed `t-1` times.
