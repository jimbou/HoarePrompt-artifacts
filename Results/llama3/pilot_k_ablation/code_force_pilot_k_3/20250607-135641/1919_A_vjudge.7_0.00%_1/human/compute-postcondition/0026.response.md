Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 2, stdin contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers. If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' is printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is printed.**

Explanation: The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten. The values of `t` and `_rep` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-5` lines of input, each containing two integers, since one line has been read. The conditions for printing 'Alice' or 'Bob' are still valid, but the values of `n` and `k` have changed.
