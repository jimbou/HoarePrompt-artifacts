To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_rep` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_rep` is 0, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_rep` needs to be incremented by 1, and `t` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 1, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers. If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' is printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is printed.**
