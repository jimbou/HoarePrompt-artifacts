To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `_rep` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_rep` is less than `t`. At the end of the last iteration, `_rep` is 1, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_rep` must be increased by 1, so `_rep` becomes 2.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables `n`, `k`, and the contents of `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 2, stdin contains `t-4` lines of input, each containing two integers. If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' is printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is printed.**
