The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split()))` accepts a line of input from stdin, splits it into two integers, and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers, and `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), the first line of input is consumed, leaving `t-2` lines of input in stdin.

The values of `n` and `k` are now integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), as specified in the initial state.

The value of `_rep` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code.

The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers.**
