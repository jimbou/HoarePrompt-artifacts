The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains multiple lines of input, and the first line contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000). This integer is assigned to `t`. The remaining lines in stdin contain two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9) for each of the `t` test cases. Since the first line has been read, there are now `t-1` lines remaining in stdin, each containing two integers `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two integers `a` and `b` (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**
