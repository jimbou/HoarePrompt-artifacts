Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `_rep` is 0, stdin contains `t-2` lines of input, each containing two integers. If `n` is greater than `k`, 'Bob' is printed. If `n` is less than `k`, 'Alice' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'Bob' is printed.***
