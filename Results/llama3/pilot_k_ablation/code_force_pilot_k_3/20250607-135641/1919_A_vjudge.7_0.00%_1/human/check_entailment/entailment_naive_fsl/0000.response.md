Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The problem description states that the player who cannot make a valid move on their turn loses, and the game is won by the player who can make a valid move on their turn. However, the program only checks if the number of coins in Alice's wallet is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of coins in Bob's wallet, and prints the winner based on this comparison.

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the actual moves made by the players. For example, in the case where Alice has 1 coin and Bob has 1 coin, the program will print "Bob" as the winner, but according to the problem description, Alice can swap wallets with Bob and then remove 1 coin from Bob's wallet, making Bob unable to make a valid move on his turn, and thus winning the game.

A correct solution would need to simulate the game and check all possible moves made by the players to determine the winner.
