The only variables in the loop head are variables  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^3, `_` is 2, a function named `func_3` has been called and returned None, and `func_3` has been called again and returned None**
