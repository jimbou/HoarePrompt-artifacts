To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

Since `k` is already a positive integer, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure it starts from 1, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is 0, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 1, `p` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
