The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, which ensures that the loop will execute, so `t` does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to 0, which is the initial value of the loop variable.
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `_` is 0, stdin contains no input**
