Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is (`n // k - 2`) * `max_val`, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 2. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `p`.***
