Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `_` is 0, a function named `func_3` has been called and returned None**

The code calls a function named `func_3`, which is not defined in the given code snippet. Since the function is not defined, it is assumed that it does not modify any variables or have any side effects. Therefore, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The function call returns None, which is not assigned to any variable.
