To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`. The loop will execute if `n // k` is at least 1, since the range starts from `n // k` and goes down to 1.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that `1 <= k <= n <= 10^4`, we can infer that `n // k` will be at least 1 if `n` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The state of `i` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of the loop, so `i` should be equal to `n // k`.

The states of `stdin`, `r`, and `max_val` are not directly related to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `stdin` is empty, `r` is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started**
