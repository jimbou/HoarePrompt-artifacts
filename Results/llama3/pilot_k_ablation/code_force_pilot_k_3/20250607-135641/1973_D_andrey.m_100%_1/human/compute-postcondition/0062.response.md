Output State: **i is 0, m is 0, j is 1, p is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: i is 0, m is 0, j is 1, p is 0. This means that the loop has finished executing and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly. The value of i is now 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of m is also 0, as it is calculated as i * max_val, and i is now 0. The value of j is 1, as it is initialized to 1 at the beginning of each iteration. The value of p is 0, as it is reset to 0 at the end of each iteration.
