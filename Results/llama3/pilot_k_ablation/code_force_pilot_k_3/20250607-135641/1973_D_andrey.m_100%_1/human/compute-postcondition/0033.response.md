Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is `k`, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise `p` is 0, `func_2(m)` has been executed, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `func_2(m)` has been executed. The values of all variables remain unchanged, as the code snippet only calls a function without modifying any variables. The stdin remains empty, as there is no input operation in the code snippet.
