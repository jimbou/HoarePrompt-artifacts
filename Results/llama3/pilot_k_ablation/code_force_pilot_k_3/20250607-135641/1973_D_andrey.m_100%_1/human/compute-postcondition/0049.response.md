The only variables in the loop head are variable  i, n and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n` and `k`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `n // k - 2`, `n` must be greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer.
State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `m` is 0, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is `k`, `p` is 0 if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `p` retains its original value, `stdin` is empty.**
