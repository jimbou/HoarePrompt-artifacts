The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1 (since the step is -1), so `i` is `n - 2`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `stdin`, `r`, and `max_val` are not in the loop head, so their states do not change.
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, stdin is empty, i is n - 2, r is the value returned by func_1(1, (n - 2) * n). If r is less than or equal to n, max_val is n - 1. Otherwise, max_val is n**
