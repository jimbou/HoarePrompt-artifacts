The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 3, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise `p` is 0.**
