Output State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is 0, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is `k`, `p` is 0 if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `p` retains its original value, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that all variables not affected by the loop head and body retain their original values. The loop counter `j` reaches its final value of `k`. The variable `p` is reset to 0 if it exceeds `n`, otherwise it retains its original value. The input stream `stdin` remains empty.
