Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, and performs the following actions:**

*   **It iterates through the range from n to 1 in reverse order and checks if the result of calling func_1(1, i * n) is less than or equal to n. If it is, it sets max_val to i and breaks the loop.**
*   **If the loop completes without finding a suitable value, max_val remains unchanged.**
*   **Then, it iterates through the range from n // k to 1 in reverse order and performs the following actions:**
    *   **It calculates m as the product of the current value i and max_val.**
    *   **It initializes p to 0 and iterates through the range from 1 to k.**
    *   **Inside this inner loop, it calls func_1(p + 1, m) and updates p with the result. If p becomes greater than or equal to n, it resets p to 0 and breaks the inner loop.**
    *   **If p equals n after the inner loop, it calls func_2(m) and returns.**
*   **If the outer loop completes without finding a suitable value, it calls func_2(-1) and returns.**

**The function's purpose is to find a suitable value for m based on the input values n and k, and then call func_2 with this value. If no suitable value is found, it calls func_2 with -1.**
