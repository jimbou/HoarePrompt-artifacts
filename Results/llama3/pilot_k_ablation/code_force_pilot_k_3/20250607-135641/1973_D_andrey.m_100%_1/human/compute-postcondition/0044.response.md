Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is 0, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and `p` is either 0 if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `p` retains its original value.***
