Output State: **n is greater than k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k - 2, m is (n // k - 2) * max_val, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, j is k, p is 0 if p is less than n, otherwise p is the value returned by func_1(p + 1, m).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the variables that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged. The variable j is equal to k, and the variable p is either 0 if it is less than n, or the value returned by func_1(p + 1, m) if it is greater than or equal to n.
