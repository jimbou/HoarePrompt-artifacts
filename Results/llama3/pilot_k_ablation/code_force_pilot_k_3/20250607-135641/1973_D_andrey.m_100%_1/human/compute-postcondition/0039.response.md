Postcondition: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is 0, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 1, `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `stdin` is empty.**
