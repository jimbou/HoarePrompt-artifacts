Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k, m is i * max_val, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, j is 2, p is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, `r`, `max_val`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only variable affected is `p`, which is assigned the value `0`. The `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables, as it is used to exit a loop, but there is no loop in this code snippet.
