Output State: **n is greater than k, k is a positive integer and greater than 3, i is n // k - 1, m is 0, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, j is 3, stdin is empty, and p is 0.**

The first line sets the value of `p` to 0. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables as it is used to exit a loop, but there is no loop in the provided code snippet. Therefore, the only change is that `p` is now 0. All other variables retain their original values.
