Output State: **`_` is `t-1`, a function named `func_3` has been called `t` times and returned None, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop variable `_` has reached a value of `t-1`, the function `func_3` has been called `t` times and has returned None each time, and the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer between 1 and 10^3.
