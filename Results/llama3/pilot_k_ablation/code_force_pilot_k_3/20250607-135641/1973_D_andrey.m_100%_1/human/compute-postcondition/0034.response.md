Output State: **The program returns nothing because the return statement is empty. All variables maintain their previous values. `n` is still greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is still a positive integer, `i` is still `n // k`, `m` is still `i * max_val`, `r` is still the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is still 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is still the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is still `k`, `p` is still the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise `p` is still 0, and `func_2(m)` has still been executed. Stdin is still empty.**
