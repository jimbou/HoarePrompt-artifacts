Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, stdin is empty, i is n - 2, r is the value returned by func_1(1, (n - 2) * n), if r is less than or equal to n, max_val is n - 1. Otherwise, max_val is n**

In this output state, the values of n, k, stdin, and i remain unchanged. The value of r has been updated to the result of func_1(1, (n - 2) * n), which is a new value. The value of max_val is still dependent on the value of r, and its value is either n - 1 or n based on the condition.
