Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k, m is i * max_val, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, j is k, p is the value returned by func_1(p + 1, m) if p is less than n, otherwise p is 0, stdin is empty.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, with the loop counter `j` reaching the value of `k`. The variable `p` has been updated according to the loop body, either by calling `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, or reset to 0 if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values.
