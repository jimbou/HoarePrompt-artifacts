Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 2, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise `p` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to be the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. If `p` was initially greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is now 0. Otherwise, `p` is now the result of the function call. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
