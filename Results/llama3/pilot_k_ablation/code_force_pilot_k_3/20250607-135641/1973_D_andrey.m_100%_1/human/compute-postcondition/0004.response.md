Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^3, `_` is 1, a function named `func_3` has been called and returned None, and `func_3` has been called again and returned None**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The function `func_3` has been called again, and since it has no side effects and returns None, the state of the program remains the same. The only change is that `func_3` has been called again, which is reflected in the output state.
