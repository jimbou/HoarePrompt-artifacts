Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k, m is i * max_val, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, j is 2. If p is greater than or equal to n, then p is 0. Otherwise, the value of p is the value returned by func_1(p + 1, m).***
