The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and k. If j is less than k + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 2, k is a positive integer, n is greater than k. For the loop to execute again j must be 3 and k must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer and greater than 3, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is 0, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 3, `stdin` is empty, and `p` is either 0 if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise `p` retains its original value.**
