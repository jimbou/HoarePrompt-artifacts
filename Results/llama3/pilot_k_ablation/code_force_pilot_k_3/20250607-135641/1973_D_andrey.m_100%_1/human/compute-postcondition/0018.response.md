Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n` // `k`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `stdin` is empty, `j` is 1***
