Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, i is n - 2, r is the value returned by func_1(1, (n - 2) * n), max_val is n - 2, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of n and k remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of i also remains the same, which is n - 2. The value of r is still the result returned by the function func_1(1, (n - 2) * n), as it is not affected by the code. The value of max_val is updated to i, which is n - 2. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
