Output State: **n is greater than k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k - 1, m is 0, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, j is k, p is 0, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`. Since `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, and `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` becomes 0. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `p`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, `j`, and `stdin` remain the same as in the initial state.
