To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `k` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `m` is 0, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0.**
