Output State: **n is greater than k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k - 2, m is (n // k - 2) * max_val, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, j is k, p is 0.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `m` and `p`. The first line assigns the product of `i` and `max_val` to `m`, making `m` equal to `(n // k - 2) * max_val`. The second line sets `p` to 0, regardless of its previous value. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `r`, `max_val`, and `j` remain unchanged.
