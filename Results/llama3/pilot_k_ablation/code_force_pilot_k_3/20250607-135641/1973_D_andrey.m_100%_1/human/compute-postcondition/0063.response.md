Output State: **`i` is 0, `m` is 0, `j` is 1, `p` is 0, and a value has been returned from the function `func_2` with argument `-1`.**

In this output state, the values of `i`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the function call. The function `func_2` is called with the argument `-1`, and a value is returned from this function call. The returned value is not assigned to any variable, so it is not stored in the output state.
