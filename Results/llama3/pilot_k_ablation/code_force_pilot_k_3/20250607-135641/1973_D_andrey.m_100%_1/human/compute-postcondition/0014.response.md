Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4, stdin is empty, i is 0, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n). If r is less than or equal to n, max_val is 0. Otherwise, max_val is the value of max_val before the loop started.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop variable `i` has reached 0, and the value of `r` is the result of the last call to `func_1(1, 0 * n)`. The value of `max_val` is either 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, or the original value of `max_val` before the loop started if `r` is greater than `n`. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
