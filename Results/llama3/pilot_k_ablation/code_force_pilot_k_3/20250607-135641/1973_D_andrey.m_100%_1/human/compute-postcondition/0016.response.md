Output State: **n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k, m is i * max_val, p is 0, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, stdin is empty**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m` and initializes `p` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `r`, and `max_val` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as it is empty.
