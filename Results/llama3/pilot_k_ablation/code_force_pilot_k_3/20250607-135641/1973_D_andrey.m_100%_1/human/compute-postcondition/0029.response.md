Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is 3, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise `p` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `m`, `r`, `max_val`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `p` is updated to be the result of the function `func_1` called with arguments `p + 1` and `m`, but only if `p` is less than `n`. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is set to 0.
