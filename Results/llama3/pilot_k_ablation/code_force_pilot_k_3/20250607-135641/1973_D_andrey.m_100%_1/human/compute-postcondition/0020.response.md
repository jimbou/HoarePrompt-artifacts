Postcondition: ***n is greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k, m is i * max_val, p is 0, r is the value returned by func_1(1, 0 * n), max_val is 0 if r is less than or equal to n, otherwise it is the value of max_val before the loop started, stdin is empty, j is 1. If p is greater than or equal to n, the program state remains unchanged. Otherwise, the program state is updated according to the else part, which is not specified.***
