Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^3, `_` is 2, a function named `func_3` has been called and returned None, and `func_3` has been called three times and returned None**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The function `func_3` has been called again, and since it has no return value (i.e., it returns None), the output state reflects this by stating that `func_3` has been called three times and returned None.
