Output State: `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `r` is the value returned by `func_1(1, 0 * n)`, `max_val` is 0 if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, otherwise it is the value of `max_val` before the loop started, `j` is `k`, `p` is the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise `p` is 0, stdin is empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows: The loop will iterate `k` times. In each iteration, the value of `p` will be updated by calling `func_1(p + 1, m)`. If `p` becomes greater than or equal to `n`, it will be reset to 0. After the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `k`, and `p` will be the value returned by `func_1(p + 1, m)` if `p` is less than `n`, otherwise it will be 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
