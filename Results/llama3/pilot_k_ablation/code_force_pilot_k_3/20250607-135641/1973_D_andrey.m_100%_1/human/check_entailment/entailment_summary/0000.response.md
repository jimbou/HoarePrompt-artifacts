Reasoning: 
The given Python program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value m such that a hidden array of length n can be split into exactly k subarrays, with each subarray having a product of its length and maximum equal to m. The program uses a combination of querying the hidden array and iterating through possible values of m to find the solution.

Function func_1 is used to query the hidden array, taking two positive integers l and x as input, where 1 <= l <= n and 1 <= x <= 10^9. It prints a query string to the console, waits for user input, and returns an integer ret obtained from the user input.

Function func_2 is used to print the answer to the problem, taking a positive integer m as input. It prints a message to the console indicating that the factorial of m is being calculated, waits for user input, and returns the user's input as an integer.

Function func_3 is the main function that solves the problem. It takes two positive integers n and k as input, where 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4. It first finds the maximum value max_val such that there exists a sequence c_1, ..., c_{k-1} satisfying the given conditions. It then iterates through possible values of m, starting from n // k * max_val and decreasing by 1 in each iteration, until it finds a value of m that satisfies the conditions. If such a value is found, it calls func_2 to print the answer; otherwise, it calls func_2 with -1 as the answer.

Function func_4 reads a positive integer t from standard input and calls func_3 t times, without returning any value or modifying the input variable t.

Based on the provided execution summaries, the program correctly implements the problem-solving strategy and uses the functions as intended. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.

Correctness: **True**
