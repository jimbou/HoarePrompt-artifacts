Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive problem described in the problem statement. The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each with a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`.

The program first checks if the maximum value `max_val` can be found by querying the function `func_1` with `i * n` as the second argument, where `i` ranges from `n` to `1`. If `max_val` is found, it breaks the loop.

Then, the program iterates over possible values of `i` from `n // k` to `1` and calculates `m` as `i * max_val`. It then queries the function `func_1` with `m` as the second argument and checks if the returned value `p` is equal to `n`. If `p` is equal to `n`, it calls the function `func_2` with `m` as the argument and returns.

If no `m` is found, the program calls the function `func_2` with `-1` as the argument.

The program correctly handles the interaction with the grader and follows the format specified in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
