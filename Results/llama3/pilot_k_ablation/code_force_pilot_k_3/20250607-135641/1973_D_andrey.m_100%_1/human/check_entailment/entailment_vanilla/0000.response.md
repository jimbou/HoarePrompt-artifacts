Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that you can split the array into exactly `k` subarrays so that all the subarrays have the product of their length and their maximum equal to `m`, or determine that no such `m` exists.

The program uses three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` is used to make queries to the hidden array, `func_2` is used to print the answer, and `func_3` is the main function that implements the logic to find the largest value `m`.

In `func_3`, the program first finds the maximum value `max_val` that can be achieved by multiplying the length of the array with the maximum value in the array. It then iterates over possible values of `i` from `n // k` to 1, and for each `i`, it calculates `m` as `i * max_val`. It then makes queries to the hidden array using `func_1` to check if it is possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with product `m`. If it is possible, it prints the answer using `func_2` and returns. If no such `m` is found, it prints -1 as the answer.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the largest value `m`. It starts with the maximum possible value `n * max_val` and iteratively decreases it until it finds a value that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.

The program also uses assertions to ensure that the inputs and outputs are valid.

Overall, the program is correct and should be able to find the largest value `m` that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.

Correctness: **True**
