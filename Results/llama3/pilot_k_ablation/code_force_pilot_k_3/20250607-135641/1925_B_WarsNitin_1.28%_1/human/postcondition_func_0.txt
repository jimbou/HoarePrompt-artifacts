This function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair consists of a number x and a number n. For each pair, it finds the largest divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition that x minus n times the divisor is non-negative and divisible by the divisor. It then prints this largest divisor for each pair. The function continues this process until all pairs have been read from standard input.
