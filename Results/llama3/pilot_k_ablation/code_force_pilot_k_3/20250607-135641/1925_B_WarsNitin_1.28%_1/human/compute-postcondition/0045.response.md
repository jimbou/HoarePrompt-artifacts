Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 2 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, otherwise 1, and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains the same, `ans` is at least 3, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now at least 3, as it was previously either 1 or 2, and now it is the maximum of those values and 3.
