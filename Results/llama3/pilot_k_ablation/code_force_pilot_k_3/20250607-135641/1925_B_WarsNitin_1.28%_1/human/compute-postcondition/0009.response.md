Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // i`, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of 1 and `x // i`. Otherwise, the program does nothing.***
