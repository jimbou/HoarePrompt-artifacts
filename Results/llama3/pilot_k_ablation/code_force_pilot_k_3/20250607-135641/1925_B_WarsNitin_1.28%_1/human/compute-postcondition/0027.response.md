The only variable in the loop head is variable  q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be 1 and the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 1. Also, since one line has been read from `stdin`, it now contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains t-2 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is being printed**
