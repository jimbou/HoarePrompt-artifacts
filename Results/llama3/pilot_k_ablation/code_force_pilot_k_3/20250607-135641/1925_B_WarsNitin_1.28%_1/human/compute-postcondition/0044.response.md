The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to 9.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 2 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, otherwise 1, and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, otherwise `ans` remains the same, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
