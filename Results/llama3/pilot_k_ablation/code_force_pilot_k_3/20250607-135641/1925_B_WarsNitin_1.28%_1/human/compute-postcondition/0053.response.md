The only variable in the loop head is variable  q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 1, `int(input())` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be 2 and `int(input())` must be greater than 2.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `q` is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is being printed**
