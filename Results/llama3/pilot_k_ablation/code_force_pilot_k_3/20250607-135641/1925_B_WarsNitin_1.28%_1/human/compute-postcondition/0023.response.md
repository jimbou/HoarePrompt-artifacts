Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and `x // 3`. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and 3. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 2`.***
