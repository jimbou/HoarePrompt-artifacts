Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` equals 0, otherwise `ans` remains the same as the previous `ans`. `i` is an integer between 3 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).***
