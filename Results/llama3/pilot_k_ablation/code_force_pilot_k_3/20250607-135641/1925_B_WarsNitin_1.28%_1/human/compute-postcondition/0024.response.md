Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `x` and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` is updated to the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `q` remains 0, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The loop iterates over all possible divisors of `x` up to its square root, updating `ans` whenever it finds a divisor that satisfies the given conditions.
