Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 2 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, otherwise 1, and `x // i`, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. The previous value of `ans` was 2 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, otherwise 1. The value of `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by `i`, which is 2. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is the maximum of 2 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, otherwise 1, and `x // 2`. The values of the other variables, `x`, `i`, `n`, and `q`, remain the same. The stdin still contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).
