The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `x` remains the same.
State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 2`.**
