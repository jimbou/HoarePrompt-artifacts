Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, i is undefined, q is 2, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), and the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0 is being printed**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `n` have been updated to the new values read from the input. The value of `ans` has been reset to 1. The value of `i` is no longer defined, as it was not updated in the code. The value of `q` remains unchanged at 2. The stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers `x` and `n`, as one line has been read and processed. The maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is still being printed.
