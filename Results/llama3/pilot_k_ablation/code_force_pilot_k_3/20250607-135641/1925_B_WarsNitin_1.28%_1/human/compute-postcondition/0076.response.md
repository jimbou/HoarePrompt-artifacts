Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `i` is an integer equal to the square root of `x` (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `x` and `n` remain within their initial ranges, `ans` is updated to be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the given conditions, `i` reaches the square root of `x`, and the other variables (`q` and `stdin`) remain unchanged.
