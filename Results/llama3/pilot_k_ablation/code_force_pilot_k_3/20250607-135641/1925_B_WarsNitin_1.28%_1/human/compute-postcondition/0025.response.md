The code prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, where `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, and `i` is a divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x`.

Output: **the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0**
