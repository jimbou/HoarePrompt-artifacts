Postcondition: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 1, `i` is an integer between 1 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`. Additionally, the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also a multiple of `i`.**
