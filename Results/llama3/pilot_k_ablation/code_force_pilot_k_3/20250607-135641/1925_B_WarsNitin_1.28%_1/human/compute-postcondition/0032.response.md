Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`. Additionally, the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and this difference is also a multiple of `i`**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (1) and `i` (1). Since `i` is 1, the value of `ans` remains 1. The other variables and conditions are not affected by this code.
