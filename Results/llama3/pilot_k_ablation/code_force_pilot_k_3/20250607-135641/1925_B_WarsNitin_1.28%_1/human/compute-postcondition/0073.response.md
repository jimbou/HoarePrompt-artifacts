Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // i`, `i` is an integer between 3 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`, where `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now the maximum of its previous value and the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`.
