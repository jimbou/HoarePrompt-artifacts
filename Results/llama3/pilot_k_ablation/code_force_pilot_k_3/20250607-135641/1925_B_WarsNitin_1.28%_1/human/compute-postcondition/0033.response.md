Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`. If the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also a multiple of `i`, then the program continues with these values. Otherwise, the program does not execute the if block.***
