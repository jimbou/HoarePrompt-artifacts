To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop iterates from 1 to `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, so for the loop to execute, `int(sqrt(x))` must be greater than 0.
2. Since `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `sqrt(x)` will be a real number between 1 and 10^4 (approximately).
3. For `int(sqrt(x))` to be greater than 0, `x` must be greater than 0.
4. Since `x` is already an integer between 1 and 10^8, we can conclude that `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute.


Now, let's adjust the states:


* `x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (since it must be greater than 1)
* `i` is 1 (since the loop starts from 1)
* `n` is an integer between 1 and `x` (no change needed)
* `ans` is 1 (no change needed)
* `q` is 0 (no change needed)
* `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`) (no change needed)


State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 1, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`)**
