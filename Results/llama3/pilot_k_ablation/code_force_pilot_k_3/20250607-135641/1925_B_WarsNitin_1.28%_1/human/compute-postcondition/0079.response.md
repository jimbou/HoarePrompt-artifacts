Output State: **`q` is `t-1`, `stdin` is empty, `x` and `n` are the last two integers read from `stdin`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is being printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter `q` will be equal to `t-1`, where `t` is the initial number of test cases. The input buffer `stdin` will be empty, as all the test cases will have been processed. The variables `x` and `n` will hold the values of the last test case processed. The variable `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`. Finally, the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` will be printed as the output.
