Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // i`, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and this difference is also divisible by `i`, then the program executes the if part. Otherwise, the program does nothing. The current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and the current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the integer division of `x` by `i` (`x // i`). The other variables remain unchanged. The program still has `t-1` lines of input in `stdin`, each containing two integers `x` and `n`. The conditions regarding the divisibility of `x` by `i`, the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i`, and the divisibility of `x - n * (x // i)` by `x // i` are still valid.
