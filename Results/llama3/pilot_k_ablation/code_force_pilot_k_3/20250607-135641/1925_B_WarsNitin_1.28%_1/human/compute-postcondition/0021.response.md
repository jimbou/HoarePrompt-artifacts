Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and `x // 3`, and `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and 3. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 2`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` being the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` or 3 still holds, but now `ans` also considers the value of `x // 3` in its calculation.
