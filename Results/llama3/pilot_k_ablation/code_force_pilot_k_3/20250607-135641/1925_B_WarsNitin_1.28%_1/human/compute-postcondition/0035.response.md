Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // i`, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`. The difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0. The current value of `x // i` is greater than 0. The difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is a multiple of `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the value of `x // i`. Since `x` is a multiple of `i` and `x // i` is greater than 0, the value of `x // i` is an integer. The value of `ans` is now the maximum of 1 and this integer value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
