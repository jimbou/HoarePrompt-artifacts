Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 2, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value (1) and the value of `i` (2). Since 2 is greater than 1, `ans` is updated to 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the stdin also remains the same, containing t-3 lines of input.
