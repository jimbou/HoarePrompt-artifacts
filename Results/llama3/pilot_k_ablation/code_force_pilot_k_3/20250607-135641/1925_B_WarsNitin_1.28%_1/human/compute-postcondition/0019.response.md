Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and 3, `stdin` contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`). If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and 3. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and 3.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` are still dependent on the divisibility of `x` by `i` and the other conditions, but now `ans` is also compared to 3.
