The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `n`. Since `x` is between 1 and 10^8, and `n` is between 1 and `x`, `x` and `n` become integers within these ranges. The second line assigns the value of 1 to `ans`. No other variables are affected. Since `q` is 0 and is not modified by the code, it remains 0. Stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x). 

Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x)**
