The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the square root of `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer between 2 and the square root of `x` (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and must be less than or equal to the square root of `x`. Therefore, `i` is an integer between 3 and the square root of `x` (inclusive).
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i)` equals 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as the previous `ans`. `i` is an integer between 3 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**
