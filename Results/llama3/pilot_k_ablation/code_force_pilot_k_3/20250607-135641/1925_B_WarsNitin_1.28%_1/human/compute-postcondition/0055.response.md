To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. The loop will execute as long as `x` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive). Since `x` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 10^8, we only need to adjust `i` to be within the specified range.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is 1, `i` is an integer between 1 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`)**
