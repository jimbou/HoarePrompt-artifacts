Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers x (1 <= x <= 10^8) and n (1 <= n <= x), and the maximum divisor of x that is less than or equal to the square root of x and satisfies the condition x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0 is being printed**

The code reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `x` and `n`, and resets `ans` to 1. The value of `q` remains unchanged. The input now contains `t-3` lines, each with two integers. The maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is being printed.
