Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `x // 2` and `x // 2`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 2`. Since `i` is 2, `x // i` is equivalent to `x // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 lines of input, each with two integers `x` and `n`.
