Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and the integer division of `x` by `i` if the difference between `x` and the product of `n` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than 0, and the remainder of the division of `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` by the integer division of `x` by `i` is equal to 0. Otherwise, `ans` remains the same as the previous `ans`. `i` is an integer between 1 and the square root of `x` (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`).***
