The code prints the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, where `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`.
Output: ** `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, `q` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers `x` (1 <= `x` <= 10^8) and `n` (1 <= `n` <= `x`), and the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and satisfies the condition `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0` is being printed**
