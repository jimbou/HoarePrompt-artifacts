Reasoning: 
The given program is incorrect. The program attempts to find the maximum total difference D by calculating the absolute differences between the maximum value in the first list and the minimum value in the second list. However, this approach is not correct because it does not consider the optimal arrangement of the elements in the second list to maximize the total difference.

The correct approach would be to sort both lists and then calculate the absolute differences between the corresponding elements in the sorted lists. The program should also consider the case where the length of the second list is greater than the length of the first list, and it should remove the excess elements from the second list before calculating the absolute differences.

Correctness: **False**
