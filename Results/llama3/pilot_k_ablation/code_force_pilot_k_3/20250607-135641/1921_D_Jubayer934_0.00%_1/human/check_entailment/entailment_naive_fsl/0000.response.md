Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the way it constructs the array `c_i` to maximize the total difference `D`. The program sorts array `b_i` and then removes the middle elements, which is not the correct approach.

A counterexample is when `a_i = [1, 2, 3]` and `b_i = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. The program will remove the middle elements of `b_i` and then construct `c_i` by taking the maximum element from `a_i` and the minimum element from the remaining `b_i`. However, this will not result in the maximum possible total difference `D`.

A correct approach would be to sort both `a_i` and `b_i` and then construct `c_i` by taking the maximum element from `a_i` and the minimum element from `b_i`, and so on. This way, the total difference `D` can be maximized.

Here is a correct implementation:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    for i in range(n):
        (m, n) = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))[:m]
        b = list(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
        a.sort()
        b.sort()
        result = []
        for i in range(len(a)):
            result.append(abs(a[i] - b[-i-1]))
        print(sum(result))
```
This implementation correctly sorts both `a_i` and `b_i` and then constructs `c_i` by taking the maximum element from `a_i` and the minimum element from `b_i`, and so on. This results in the maximum possible total difference `D`.
