Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is equal to m, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The variable `i` has reached the value of `m`, which is the length of the list `a`. The list `b` has been reduced to a sorted list of `max(0, n-m)` integers, where `max(0, n-m)` represents the maximum of 0 and the difference between `n` and `m`. The other variables, `result` and `stdin`, remain unchanged. The sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is still being printed.
