The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is between 1 and 10^5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 2 and 10^5, i is 1, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, result is a list containing m integers which are the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers, and the sum of the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, which is equal to sum(result) is being printed**
