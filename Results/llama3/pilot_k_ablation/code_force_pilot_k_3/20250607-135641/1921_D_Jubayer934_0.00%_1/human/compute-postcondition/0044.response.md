To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(a)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the list `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than 0, and `a` is a list of at least `i-1` integers. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have at least `i` integers.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is greater than 1 (since it was incremented by 1)
* `a` is a list of at least `i` integers (since it had at least `i-1` integers previously)

The other variables `m`, `n`, `b`, and `result` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, `i` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of at least `i` integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, n - m)-1 integers, `result` is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers**
