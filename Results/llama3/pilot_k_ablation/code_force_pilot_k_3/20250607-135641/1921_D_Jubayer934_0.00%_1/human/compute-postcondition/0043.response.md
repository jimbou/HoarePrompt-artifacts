Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is greater than 0, a is a list of at least i-1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - m)-1 integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

In this final state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, still being an integer between 1 and 5*10^4. The value of `i` is still greater than 0. The list `a` has been modified by removing its maximum value, so it now contains at least `i-1` integers. The list `b` has also been modified by removing its minimum value, so it now contains `max(0, n - m)-1` integers and remains sorted. The list `result` now contains the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
