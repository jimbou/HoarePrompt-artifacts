State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is at least 2, a is a list of at least 1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-1) integers, result is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the original max(a) and min(b), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**
