Postcondition: ***m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is 0, a is a list of m integers that is not empty, b is a sorted list of n integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. If the length of a is equal to the length of b, the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the function continues to execute.***
