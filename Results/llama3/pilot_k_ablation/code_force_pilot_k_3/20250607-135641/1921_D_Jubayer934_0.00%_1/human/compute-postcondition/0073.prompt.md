Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is equal to m, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
    a.remove(max(a))
    b.remove(min(b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: m is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is 0, a is a list of m-1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-1) integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: m is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is 1, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-2) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: m is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is 2, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-3) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
