The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that is not empty. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must have at least 2 integers.
State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**
