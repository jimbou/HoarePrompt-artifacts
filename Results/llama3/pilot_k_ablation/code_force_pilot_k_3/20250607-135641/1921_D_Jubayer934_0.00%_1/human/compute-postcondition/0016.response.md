Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is equal to the length of a, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of the list `a`, and the list `b` will be shortened by the length of `a` (or to an empty list if `a` is longer than `b`). The other variables remain unchanged.
