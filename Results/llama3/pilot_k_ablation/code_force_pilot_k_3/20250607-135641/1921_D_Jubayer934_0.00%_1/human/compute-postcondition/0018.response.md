The code snippet provided calculates the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b`, appends this difference to the `result` list, removes the maximum value from list `a`, and removes the minimum value from list `b`. 

Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

- The `result` list, which was initially empty, now contains the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b`.
- List `a`, which initially contained at least 1 integer, now has one less integer because the maximum value has been removed.
- List `b`, which was a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, now has one less integer because the minimum value has been removed.

Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is at least 1, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-1) integers, result is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the original max(a) and min(b), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**
