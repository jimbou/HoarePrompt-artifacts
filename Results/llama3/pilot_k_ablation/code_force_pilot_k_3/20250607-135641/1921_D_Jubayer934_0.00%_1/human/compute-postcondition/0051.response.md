State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is equal to 1, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - m)-i integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed**
