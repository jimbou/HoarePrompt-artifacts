To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element, because `range(len(a))` will be non-empty. Since `i` is equal to the length of `a`, we can adjust `i` to be at least 1.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers**
