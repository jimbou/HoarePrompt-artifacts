Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is greater than 2, a is a list of at least i-1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - m)-3 integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers**

The code first appends the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b` to the list `result`. Then, it removes the maximum value from list `a` and the minimum value from list `b`. As a result, list `a` now contains at least `i-1` integers, and list `b` contains `max(0, n - m)-3` integers. The value of `m`, `n`, and `i` remains unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
