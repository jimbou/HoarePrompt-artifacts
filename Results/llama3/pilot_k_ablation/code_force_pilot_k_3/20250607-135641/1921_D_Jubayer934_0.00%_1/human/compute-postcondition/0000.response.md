Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 × 10^5, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains an integer m (n ≤ m ≤ 2 × 10^5). The second line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) and n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been assigned an integer between 1 and 2 × 10^5 from the input. The stdin now contains the remaining input for the test case, which includes an integer `m` and two lists of integers `a_i` and `b_i`. The values of `m`, `a_i`, and `b_i` are still unknown and will be determined by the remaining input.
