Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is being printed. The current value of `a` and `b` have the same length, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `result` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is still being printed, and the current value of `a` and `b` still have the same length.
