Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is 1, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers, and the sum of the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, which is equal to sum(result) is being printed**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` is now an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, which is half of its original value. The value of `i` remains unchanged as 1. The list `a` now contains `m` integers. The list `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, where `n` is half of its original value. The list `result` is empty. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers, and the sum of the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, which is equal to sum(result) is being printed.
