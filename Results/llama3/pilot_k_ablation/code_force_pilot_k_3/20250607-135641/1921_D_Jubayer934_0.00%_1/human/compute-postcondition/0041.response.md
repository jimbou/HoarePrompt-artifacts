Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is equal to the length of a, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - m) integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of list `a`, and the length of list `b` will be the maximum of 0 and `n - m`, where `n` is the initial length of list `b` and `m` is the length of list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
