Output: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, result is a list containing m integers which are the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers, and the sum of the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, which is equal to sum(result) is being printed**
