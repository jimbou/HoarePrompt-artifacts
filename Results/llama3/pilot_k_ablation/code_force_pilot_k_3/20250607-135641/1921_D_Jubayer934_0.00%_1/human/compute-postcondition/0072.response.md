Output State: **m is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is 2, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-3) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed.**

The code block modifies the lists `a` and `b` by removing the maximum value from `a` and the minimum value from `b`, and appends the absolute difference between these two values to the `result` list. The number of integers in `a` and `b` decreases by 1, and the number of absolute differences in `result` increases by 1. The values of `m`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
