Postcondition: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is 0, a is a list of m integers that is not empty, b is a sorted list of n integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers, and the sum of the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, which is equal to sum(result) is being printed. The current value of the length of a is equal to the length of b.**
