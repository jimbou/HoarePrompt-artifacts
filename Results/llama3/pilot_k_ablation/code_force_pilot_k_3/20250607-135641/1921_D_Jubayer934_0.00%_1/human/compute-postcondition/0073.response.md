Output State: **m is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is equal to m, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list 'a' will be empty because all its elements have been removed, and the list 'result' will contain the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list 'a' and the minimum value in the original list 'b' for each iteration of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
