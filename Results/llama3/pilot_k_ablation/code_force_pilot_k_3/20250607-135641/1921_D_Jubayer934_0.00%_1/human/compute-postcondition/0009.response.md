Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `result` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
