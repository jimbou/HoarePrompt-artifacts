The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m-1` integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `a` must have at least 1 integer.
State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-1) integers, `result` is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list `a` and the minimum value in the original list `b`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is being printed**
