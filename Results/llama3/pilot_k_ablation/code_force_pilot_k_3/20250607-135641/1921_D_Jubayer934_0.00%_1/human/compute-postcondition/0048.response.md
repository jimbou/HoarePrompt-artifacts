Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is equal to 0, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - m)-i integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable 'i' will be equal to 0, the list 'a' will be empty, and the list 'b' will have 'max(0, n - m)-i' elements. The list 'result' will contain the absolute differences between the maximum value in 'a' and the minimum value in 'b' for each iteration of the loop. The other variables 'm' and 'n' will retain their initial values, and the stdin will still contain multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
