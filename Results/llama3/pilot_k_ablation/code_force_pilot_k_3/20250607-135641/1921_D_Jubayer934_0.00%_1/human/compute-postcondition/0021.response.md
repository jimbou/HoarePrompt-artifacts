State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least 1 integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-3) integers, `result` is a list containing 2 integers which are the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b) and the new max(a) and min(b), `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**
