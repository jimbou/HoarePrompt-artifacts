Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still between 1 and 10^5, but the length of `b` has been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still dependent on the lengths of `a` and `b`.
