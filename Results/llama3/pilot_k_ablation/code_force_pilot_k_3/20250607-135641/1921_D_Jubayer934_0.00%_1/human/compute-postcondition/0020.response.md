Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is at least 2, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-2) integers, result is a list containing 2 integers which are the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b) and the new max(a) and min(b), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

The code first appends the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b` to the `result` list. Then, it removes the maximum value from list `a` and the minimum value from list `b`. As a result, list `a` may become empty if it originally contained only one integer, and list `b` will have one less integer. The number of integers in list `b` is now `max(0, n-m-2)`. The values of `m`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.
