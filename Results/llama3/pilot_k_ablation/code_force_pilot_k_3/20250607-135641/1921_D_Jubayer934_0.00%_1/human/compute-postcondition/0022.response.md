Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is at least 3, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-4) integers, result is a list containing 3 integers which are the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and the new max(a) and the new min(b), stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, still being an integer between 1 and 10^5. The value of `i` is still at least 3. The list `a` has been modified by removing its maximum value, so it now contains at least 0 integers. The list `b` has also been modified by removing its minimum value, so it now contains a sorted list of max(0, n-m-4) integers. The list `result` has been appended with the absolute difference between the original maximum value of `a` and the original minimum value of `b`, and now contains 3 integers which are the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and the new max(a) and the new min(b). The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, still containing multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
