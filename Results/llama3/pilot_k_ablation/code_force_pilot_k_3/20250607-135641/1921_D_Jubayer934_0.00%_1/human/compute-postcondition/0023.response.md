Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, i is 0, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, result is a list containing m integers which are the absolute differences between the original max(a) and min(b), the new max(a) and min(b), and so on, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list 'a' will be empty, the list 'b' will have the same number of elements as the initial value of 'n' minus 'm', and the list 'result' will contain 'm' integers, each representing the absolute difference between the maximum element of 'a' and the minimum element of 'b' at each iteration. The values of 'm', 'n', and 'stdin' remain unchanged.
