To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `a` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The length of `a` remains the same, but since we are considering the next iteration, we need to ensure that the length of `a` is at least 3 to satisfy the condition `i < len(a)`.

The other variables `m`, `n`, `b`, and `result` are not part of the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-2` integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
