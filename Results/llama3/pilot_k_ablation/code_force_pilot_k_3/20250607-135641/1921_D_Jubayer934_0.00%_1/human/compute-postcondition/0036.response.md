Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-2` integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `m` is unchanged, `n` is still between 1 and 5*10^4, `i` is still 1, `a` is still a list of at least 2 integers, `result` is still an empty list, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. However, the list `b` has been modified by removing its last element, so it now contains `n-2` integers. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we exit the innermost loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of the variables remains the same.
