Output State: **m is an integer, n is 0, i is equal to the initial value of n, a is an empty list, b is an empty list, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains no more test cases, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations. The loop counter `i` has reached the initial value of `n`, which means that all test cases have been processed. The lists `a` and `b` are empty because all elements have been removed during the loop iterations. The `result` list contains the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list `a` and the minimum value in the original list `b` for each test case. The input stream `stdin` is empty because all test cases have been read and processed. Finally, the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is printed as the final output.
