To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is equal to `m` and `a` is a list of `m` integers, we can infer that `m` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 0, which is the first index of the list `a`.

State: **`m` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, n-m) integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is being printed**
