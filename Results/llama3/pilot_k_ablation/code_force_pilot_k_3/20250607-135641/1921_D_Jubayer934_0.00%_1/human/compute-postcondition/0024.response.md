The code prints the sum of the result list, which contains the absolute differences between the original maximum of list a and minimum of list b, the new maximum of list a and minimum of list b, and so on.
Since the exact values of list a and list b are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum of the result list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values of the two lists.
Output: **sum of absolute differences between max(a) and min(b) (where a and b are the lists of integers)**
