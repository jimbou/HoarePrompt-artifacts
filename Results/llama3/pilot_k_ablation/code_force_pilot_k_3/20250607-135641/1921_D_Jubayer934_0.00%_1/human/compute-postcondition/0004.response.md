Postcondition: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. The current value of `a` and `b` have the same length.**
