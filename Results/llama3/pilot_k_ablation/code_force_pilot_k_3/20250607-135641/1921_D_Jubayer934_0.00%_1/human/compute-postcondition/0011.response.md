Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-2` integers, `result` is an empty list, if the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.**

The code removes the last element from the sorted list `b`, which has `n-1` integers. After removal, `b` will have `n-2` integers. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still dependent on the length of `a` being equal to the length of `b`. If this condition is met, the program will break out of the loop or if statement; otherwise, it will continue executing. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
