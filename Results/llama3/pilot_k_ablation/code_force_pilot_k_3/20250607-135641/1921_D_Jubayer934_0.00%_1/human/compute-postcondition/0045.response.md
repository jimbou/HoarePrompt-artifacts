Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is greater than 1, a is a list of at least i-1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - m)-2 integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers**

In this output state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, still being an integer between 1 and 5*10^4. The value of `i` is still greater than 1. The list `a` now contains at least `i-1` integers, as one integer has been removed from it. The list `b` is still sorted but now contains `max(0, n - m)-2` integers, as one integer has been removed from it. The list `result` now contains the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`. Stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
