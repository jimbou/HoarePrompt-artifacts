The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b` for each test case.
Since `a` is an empty list, the maximum value in `a` is undefined. 
Since `b` is a sorted list of `max(0, n - m)-i` integers, the minimum value in `b` is the smallest integer in the list.
The absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is undefined because the maximum value in `a` is undefined.
The sum of the absolute differences is undefined because the absolute differences are undefined.
Output: **undefined**
