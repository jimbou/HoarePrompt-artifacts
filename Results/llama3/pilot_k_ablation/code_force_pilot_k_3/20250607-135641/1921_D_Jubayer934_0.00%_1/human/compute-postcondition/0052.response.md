Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is equal to 1, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed**

In this output state, the values of `m` and `n` are updated based on the input provided. The list `a` now contains `m` integers, and the list `b` contains `n` integers, which is half of its original size due to the line `n = n // 2`. The list `result` remains empty, as no operations were performed on it. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, as only two inputs were consumed by the code. The sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is still being printed, as this was the original purpose of the code.
