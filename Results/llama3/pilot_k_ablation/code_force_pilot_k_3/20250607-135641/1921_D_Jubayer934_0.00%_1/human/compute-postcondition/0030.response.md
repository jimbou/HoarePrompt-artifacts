Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, i is 0, a is a list of m integers that is not empty, b is a sorted list of n integers, result is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables m, n, i, a, b, and result remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
