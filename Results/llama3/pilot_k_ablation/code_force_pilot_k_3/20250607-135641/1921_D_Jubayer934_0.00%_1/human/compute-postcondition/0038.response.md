Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 5*10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-2` integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `result` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers.
