Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, if the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two lists of integers. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
