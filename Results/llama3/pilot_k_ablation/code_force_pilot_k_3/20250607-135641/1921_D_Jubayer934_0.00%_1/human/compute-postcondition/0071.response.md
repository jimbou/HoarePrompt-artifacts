State: **m is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is 2, a is a list of at least 1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-2) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed.**
