The value of `b` is updated by removing the last element from the list `b`. The last element of `b` is `b[n - 1]`. The length of `b` is reduced by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The length of `a` is still equal to the length of `b` or not, so the program may or may not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is still being printed. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.

Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In any case, the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is being printed.**
