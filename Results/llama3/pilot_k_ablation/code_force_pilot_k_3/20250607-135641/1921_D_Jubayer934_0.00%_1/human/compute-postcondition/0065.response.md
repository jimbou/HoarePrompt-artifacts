Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-3` integers, `result` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues its execution.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by removing the last element (`b[n - 1]`) from the list. The length of `b` is now `n-3` instead of `n-2`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program's execution continues or breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement based on the comparison between the lengths of `a` and `b`.
