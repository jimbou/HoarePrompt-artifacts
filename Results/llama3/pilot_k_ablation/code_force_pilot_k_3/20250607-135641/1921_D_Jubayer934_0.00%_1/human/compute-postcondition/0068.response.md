Output State: **m is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, i is 0, a is a list of m-1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n-m-1) integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b is being printed**

The code executes the following operations:

1. It appends the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b` to the `result` list.
2. It removes the maximum value from list `a`.
3. It removes the minimum value from list `b`.

After these operations, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `m` remains greater than 0, as no operation affects its value.
- `n` remains an integer between 1 and 2.5*10^4, as no operation affects its value.
- `i` remains 0, as no operation affects its value.
- `a` becomes a list of `m-1` integers, as the maximum value is removed from it.
- `b` becomes a sorted list of `max(0, n-m-1)` integers, as the minimum value is removed from it.
- `result` becomes a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list `a` and the minimum value in the original list `b`.
- Stdin remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
- The sum of the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` is still being printed.
