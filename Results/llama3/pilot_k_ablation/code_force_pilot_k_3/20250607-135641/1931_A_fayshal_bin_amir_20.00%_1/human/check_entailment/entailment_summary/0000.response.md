Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly determines the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by first checking if the integer is less than or equal to 26, in which case it constructs the word by taking the first two letters as 'a' and the third letter as the corresponding letter for the remaining value. If the integer is greater than 26, it constructs the word by taking the first letter as the corresponding letter for the quotient of the integer divided by 26, the second letter as the corresponding letter for the remainder of the integer divided by 26, and the third letter as 'z'. The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for the given examples.

Correctness: **True**
