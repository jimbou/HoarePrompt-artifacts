Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by iterating through the possible values of the first letter of the word, and then determining the remaining two letters based on the given integer.

The program correctly handles the cases where the integer is less than or equal to 26, 27 to 52, and 53 to 78. In each case, it correctly calculates the values of the three letters that would result in the given integer when encoded.

The program also correctly uses the `chr` function to convert the calculated values into lowercase English letters. The `chr` function returns a string representing a character whose Unicode code point is the integer, and the program uses this to convert the calculated values into letters.

The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors. It correctly handles all possible inputs and produces the correct output for each input.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
