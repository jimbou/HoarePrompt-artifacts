Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the k-th card that Vladislav lays down in the process. The program uses a while loop to iterate through the different sets of cards (odd numbers, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, etc.) and keeps track of the number of cards in each set. It then uses this information to calculate the k-th card.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including when k is larger than the number of cards in the current set, in which case it moves on to the next set. It also handles the case when n is 1, in which case it simply returns 1.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
