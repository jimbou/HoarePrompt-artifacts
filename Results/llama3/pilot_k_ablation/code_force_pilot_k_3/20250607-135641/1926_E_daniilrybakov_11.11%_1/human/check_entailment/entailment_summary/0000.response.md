Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of cards `n` and the position `k` of the card to be determined.
3.  It calculates the number of odd-numbered cards `s` by performing integer division of `n` by 2 and adding 1 (to account for the ceiling function).
4.  It then enters a loop where it continuously updates the values of `s`, `n`, and `m` until `s` is greater than or equal to `k`.
5.  Inside the loop, it checks if `n` becomes 0. If so, it resets `s` to the original value of `n` and sets `n` to 1. This is done to handle cases where `k` exceeds the number of cards in the current iteration.
6.  If `n` is not 0, it updates `m` by multiplying it by 2, updates `n` by performing integer division by 2, and adds the new value of `n` to `s`.
7.  Once the loop exits, it calculates the value of the `k`-th card using the formula `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` and prints the result.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem's requirements. It handles edge cases and boundary conditions appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
