Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is less than k, s is equal to k, m is a power of 2, k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), n is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive.
* The value of `_` remains unchanged, still 2.
* The value of `n_back` remains unchanged, still less than `k`.
* The value of `s` is now equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has terminated.
* The value of `m` is a power of 2, having been multiplied by 2 in each iteration of the loop.
* The value of `k` remains unchanged, still greater than `n_back` (and thus at least 2).
* The value of `n` is now 0, indicating that the loop has terminated.

Note that the values of `s`, `m`, and `n` have changed as a result of the loop executing, while the values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `k` remain unchanged.
