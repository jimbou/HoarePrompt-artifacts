To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the variables and their values based on the initial state:

1. `t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, but its value isn't directly used in the print statement.
2. `_` is 1, but it's not used in the print statement.
3. `n_back` is an integer, but its value isn't directly provided.
4. `s` is equal to `n_back` if `n` is 0, otherwise `s` is equal to `k`. Since `n` is 0, `s` equals `n_back`.
5. `m` is 2^x where `x` is the number of iterations. However, the number of iterations isn't directly provided, but we know `n` is 0, which might imply a specific iteration count or condition.
6. `n` is 0.
7. `stdin` contains no input, which doesn't affect the print statement directly.
8. `k` is an integer.

Given these conditions, let's analyze the print statement:

```python
print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)
```

Since `n` is 0, the expression simplifies to:

```python
print((2 * (k - s)) - 1) * m)
```

Given that `s` equals `n_back` because `n` is 0, we can further simplify it to:

```python
print((2 * (k - n_back)) - 1) * m)
```

However, without explicit values for `k`, `n_back`, and the number of iterations (which determines `m`), we cannot compute an exact numerical value. But we can describe the output based on the given variables:

The output will be the result of the expression `(2 * (k - n_back) - 1)` multiplied by `m`, where `k` is an integer, `n_back` is an integer, and `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations.

Output: **(2 * (k - n_back) - 1) * (2^x) (where k is an integer, n_back is an integer, and x is the number of iterations)**
