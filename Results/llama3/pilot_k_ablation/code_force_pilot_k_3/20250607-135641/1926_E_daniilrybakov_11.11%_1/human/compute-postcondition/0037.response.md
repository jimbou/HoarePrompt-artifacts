The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n_back` is an integer, `s` is equal to `n_back` if `n` is 0, otherwise `s` is equal to `k`, `m` is 2^x where x is the number of iterations, `n` is 0, stdin contains no input, `k` is an integer, and this is printed: (2 * (`k` - (`s` - `n`)) - 1) * `m`, where `s` is equal to `n_back` and `m` is 2^x**
