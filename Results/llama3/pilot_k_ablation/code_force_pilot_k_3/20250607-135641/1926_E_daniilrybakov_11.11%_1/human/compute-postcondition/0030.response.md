To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `s` and `k` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is less than `(n + 1) // 2 + n // 2` and `k` is greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `s` to be less than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s` and `k` to be greater than the new value of `s`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n_back` is an integer, `m` is 4, `s` is less than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`, `n` is (n + 1) // 4, `k` is greater than the new value of `s`**
