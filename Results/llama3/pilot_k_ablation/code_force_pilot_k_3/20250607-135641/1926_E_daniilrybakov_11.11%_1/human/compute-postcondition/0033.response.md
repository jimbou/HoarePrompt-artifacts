Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, m is 8, s is less than the maximum possible odd integer value of s plus n // 2, n is (n + 1) // 4 // 2, k is greater than the new value of s. If n is 0, then s is equal to the original value of n_back and n is 1. Otherwise, the values of s and n remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been doubled to 8, `n` has been halved, and `s` has been incremented by the new value of `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `k` remain unchanged. The relationship between `s`, `n`, and `n_back` is maintained, with `s` being less than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s` plus `n // 2`, and `n` being `(n + 1) // 4 // 2`. If `n` is 0, then `s` is equal to the original value of `n_back` and `n` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.
