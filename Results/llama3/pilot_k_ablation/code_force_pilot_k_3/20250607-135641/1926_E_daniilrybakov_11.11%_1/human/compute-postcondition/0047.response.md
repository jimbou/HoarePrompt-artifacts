Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is less than k, s is equal to n_back plus n, m is 4, k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), n is either 0 or n divided by 2.**

The code block modifies the values of `m`, `n`, and `s`. The first line doubles the value of `m`, making it 4. The second line halves the value of `n`. If `n` was initially 0, it remains 0; otherwise, it is divided by 2. The third line adds the value of `n` to `s`, making `s` equal to `n_back` plus `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `k` remain unchanged.
