The code snippet consists of three lines: `s = n_back`, `n = 1`, and `break`. 

The first line assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`. Since `s` was equal to `n_back` plus 0, which is essentially `n_back`, this line does not change the value of `s`. It remains equal to `n_back`.

The second line assigns the value 1 to `n`. Since `n` was 0, this line changes the value of `n` to 1.

The third line is a `break` statement, which terminates the loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, this statement has no effect.

Considering the initial state and the changes made by the code, the final state is as follows:

Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is less than k, s is equal to n_back, m is 4, k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), n is 1**
