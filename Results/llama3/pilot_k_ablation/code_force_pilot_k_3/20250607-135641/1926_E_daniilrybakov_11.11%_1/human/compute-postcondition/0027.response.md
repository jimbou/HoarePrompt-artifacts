Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back, m is 2, n is 1, k is greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of s**

The code snippet assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`, sets `n` to 1, and breaks out of the loop. The values of `t`, `_`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to be equal to `n_back`, and the value of `n` is set to 1. The break statement exits the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, it has no effect.
