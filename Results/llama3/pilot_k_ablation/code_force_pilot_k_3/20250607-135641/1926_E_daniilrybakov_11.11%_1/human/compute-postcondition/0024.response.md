Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back if n is 0, otherwise s is equal to (n + 1) // 2, m is 1, n is 1 if n is 0, otherwise n is (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains no input, k must be greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of s***
