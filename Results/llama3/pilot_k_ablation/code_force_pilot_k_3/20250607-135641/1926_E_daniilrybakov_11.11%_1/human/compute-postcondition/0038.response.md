Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is an integer, s is equal to (n + 1) // 2, m is 1, n is (n + 1) // 2, k is an integer, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where s is equal to (n + 1) // 2 and m is 1**

The code first assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input to the variables `n` and `k`. Then, it assigns the value of `n` to `n_back`. The value of `s` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and the value of `n` is updated to `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `m` is set to 1. The printed expression is calculated using the updated values of `s`, `n`, and `m`. The value of `t` and `_` remains unchanged.
