Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back plus n, k is greater than n_back, m is twice its original value, n is less than k minus n_back. If n is 0, then n is updated to 1 and s is equal to n_back. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
