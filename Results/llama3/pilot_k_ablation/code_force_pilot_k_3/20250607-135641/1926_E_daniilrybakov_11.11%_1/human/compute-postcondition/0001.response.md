To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (although `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is still determined by the range it iterates over, which is `t`).

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `t` is already given to be an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, we can conclude that `t` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

The loop variable `_` will take on values from 0 to `t-1` during the execution of the loop. Therefore, at the start of the loop, `_` must be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 0**
