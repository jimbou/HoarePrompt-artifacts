Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, m is 4. If n is 0, then s is equal to n_back and n is 0. Otherwise, s is less than (n + 1) // 2 + n // 2 and n is (n + 1) // 4. k is greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of s.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been doubled to 4. The value of `n` has been halved, and the value of `s` has been increased by the new value of `n`. The relationship between `s` and `n` has been maintained, with `s` still being less than `(n + 1) // 2 + n // 2`. The value of `k` remains greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `n_back` remain unchanged.
