Output: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is less than k, s is equal to k, m is a power of 2, k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), n is 0, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), s is equal to k, n is 0, and m is a power of 2**
