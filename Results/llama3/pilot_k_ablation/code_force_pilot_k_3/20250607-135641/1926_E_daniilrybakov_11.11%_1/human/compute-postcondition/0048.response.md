The variable in the loop head is s and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables s and k. If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is equal to n_back plus n, k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), n is either 0 or n divided by 2, and n_back is less than k. For the loop to execute again, s must be less than k. Since s is equal to n_back plus n, and n_back is less than k, we need to ensure that n_back plus n is less than k. We can't adjust n_back because it's not in the loop head, but we can adjust n. Since n is either 0 or n divided by 2, we can adjust it to be 0, which ensures that s (n_back plus n) is less than k. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is less than k, s is equal to n_back plus 0, m is 4, k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), n is 0**
