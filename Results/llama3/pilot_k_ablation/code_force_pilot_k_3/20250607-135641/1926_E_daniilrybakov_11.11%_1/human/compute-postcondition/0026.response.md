To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `s` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2 + n // 2` if `n` is not 0, and `s` is equal to `n_back` if `n` is 0. `k` must be greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `s` to be less than `k`. Since `s` is an integer, we can adjust its state to be less than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`, which is `(n + 1) // 2 + n // 2` if `n` is not 0, and `n_back` if `n` is 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n_back` is an integer, `s` is less than `(n + 1) // 2 + n // 2` if `n` is not 0, and `s` is less than `n_back` if `n` is 0, `m` is 2, `n` is `(n + 1) // 4`, `stdin` contains no input, `k` must be greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`**
