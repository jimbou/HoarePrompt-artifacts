The code snippet consists of three lines that modify the values of variables `m`, `n`, and `s`. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line multiplies the value of `m` by 2. Since `m` is initially 1, it becomes 2.

The second line performs integer division of `n` by 2. Since `n` is initially 1, it becomes 0.

The third line adds the value of `n` to `s`. Since `n` is now 0, `s` remains unchanged, which is equal to `n_back`.

Considering the initial state and the changes made by the code, the final output state is:

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back, n is 0, m is 2, stdin contains no input, k must be greater than 0**
