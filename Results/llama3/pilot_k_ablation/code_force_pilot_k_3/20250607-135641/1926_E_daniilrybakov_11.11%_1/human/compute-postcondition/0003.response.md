To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `s < k`. The only variables in the loop head are `s` and `k`. 

Right before the loop, `s` is an integer equal to `(n_back + 1) // 2`, and there is no information about `k`. For the loop to execute, `s` must be less than `k`. Since `s` is derived from `n_back`, we cannot directly adjust `s` without considering its relationship with `n_back`. However, we can infer that for `s` to be less than `k`, `k` must be greater than `s`.

Given that `s` is an integer equal to `(n_back + 1) // 2`, and `n_back` is an integer, we can conclude that `s` is at least 1 (since `n_back` is an integer, `(n_back + 1) // 2` will always be at least 1 for any positive `n_back`, and it can be 0 if `n_back` is -1, but since `s` is an integer, we consider the minimum value of `s` as 0). Therefore, for the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop condition only depends on `s` and `k`.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n is an integer equal to (n_back + 1) // 2, n_back is an integer, s is an integer equal to (n_back + 1) // 2, m is 1, stdin contains no input, k must be greater than 0**
