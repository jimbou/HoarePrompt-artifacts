According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n_back` is an integer, `s` is equal to `k`, `m` is a power of 2, `n` is 0, `stdin` contains no input, `k` is greater than 0**
