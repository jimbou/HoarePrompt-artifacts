Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to k, m is a power of 2, n is 0, stdin contains no input, k is greater than 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of s is equal to k, the value of m is a power of 2, and the value of n is 0. The values of t, _, n_back, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of k is greater than 0.
