Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is less than k, s is equal to n_back + n // 2, m is 8, k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2), n is updated to n // 2 if n was originally 0, then n is updated to 1. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line multiplies the value of `m` by 2, making it 8. The second line performs integer division of `n` by 2, updating its value. The third line adds the updated value of `n` to `s`, making it equal to `n_back + n // 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
