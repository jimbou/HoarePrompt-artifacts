Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back, n is 1, k is greater than n_back, m is twice its original value.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`, effectively setting `s` equal to `n_back`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `n`. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state provides the following information: `t` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 0, `n_back` is an integer, `s` is equal to `n_back` plus `n`, `k` is greater than `n_back`, `m` is twice its original value, and `n` is less than `k` minus `n_back`.

After executing the code, the values of `s` and `n` are modified. `s` is now equal to `n_back`, and `n` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the final output state is as described above.
