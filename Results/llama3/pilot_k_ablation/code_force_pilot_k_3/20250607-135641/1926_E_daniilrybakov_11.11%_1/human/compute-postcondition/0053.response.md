The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`. Let's break it down step by step:

* `s` is equal to `k`, so `s - n` is equal to `k - 0`, which is just `k`.
* `k - (s - n)` is then equal to `k - k`, which is `0`.
* `2 * (k - (s - n))` is then equal to `2 * 0`, which is `0`.
* `0 - 1` is equal to `-1`.
* Finally, `-1 * m` is equal to `-m`.

Since `m` is a power of 2, the result will be a negative power of 2.

Output: **-m (where m is a power of 2)**
