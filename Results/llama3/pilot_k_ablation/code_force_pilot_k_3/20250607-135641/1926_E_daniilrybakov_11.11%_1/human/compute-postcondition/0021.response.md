To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `s < k`. The variables involved in this condition are `s` and `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive
- `_` is 1
- `n_back` is an integer
- `s` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`
- `m` is 1
- `n` is `(n + 1) // 2`
- `stdin` contains no input
- `k` is an integer

We need to adjust the states of `s` and `k` to ensure that `s < k` is true for the loop to execute at least once.

Since `s` is derived from `n` as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `n` is also `(n + 1) // 2`, this implies `n` must be an odd number (because only then can `n` be equal to `(n + 1) // 2`), making `s` also an odd number because it's derived from `n` in the same way.

However, without knowing the exact value of `n`, we cannot determine the exact value of `s`, but we know it's an odd number.

For `k` to be greater than `s`, `k` must be at least one more than the maximum possible value of `s`. Since `s` is derived from `n` and `n` is at most `(5 * 10^4 + 1) // 2` (considering the maximum value of `t` and assuming `n` could be as large as `t`), the maximum value of `s` could be roughly half of `5 * 10^4`, which is `2.5 * 10^4`. However, since `s` must be an odd integer, its maximum value would be less than this, specifically `2.5 * 10^4 - 0.5`, but since we're dealing with integers, we consider the nearest odd integer below this value, which is not directly calculable without considering the exact nature of `n`. However, we know `s` will be significantly less than `5 * 10^4`.

To ensure `s < k`, `k` must be greater than the maximum possible value of `s`. Since we cannot precisely define the maximum value of `s` without more information on `n`, we can say `k` must be greater than the odd integer that represents the maximum possible value of `s`, which is derived from the maximum possible value of `n`.

Given the constraints and the need to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we adjust the state of `k` to be greater than the maximum possible value of `s`, which is an odd integer derived from `n`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n_back` is an integer, `s` is equal to `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 1, `n` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `stdin` contains no input, `k` must be greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`**
