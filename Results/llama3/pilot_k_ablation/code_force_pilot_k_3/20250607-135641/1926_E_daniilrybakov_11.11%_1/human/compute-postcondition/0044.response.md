According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to `n_back + 0`, and `k` is greater than `n_back` (and thus at least 2). For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be less than `k`, so `n_back` must be less than `k`. Since `k` is greater than `n_back`, we can adjust `n_back` to be less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 2, `n_back` is less than `k`, `s` is equal to `n_back + 0`, `m` is 2, `n` is 0, and `k` is greater than `n_back` (and thus at least 2)**
