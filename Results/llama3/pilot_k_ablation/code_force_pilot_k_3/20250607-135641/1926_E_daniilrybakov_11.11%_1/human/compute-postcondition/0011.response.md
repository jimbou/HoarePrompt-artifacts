Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back plus n, k is greater than n_back, m is twice its original value, n is half its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n_back` remains an integer as it is not changed by the code. The value of `s` is updated to be equal to `n_back` plus `n`, as the third line of the code adds `n` to `s`. The value of `k` remains greater than `n_back` as it is not modified by the code. The value of `m` is doubled as the first line of the code multiplies it by 2. The value of `n` is halved as the second line of the code performs integer division by 2.
