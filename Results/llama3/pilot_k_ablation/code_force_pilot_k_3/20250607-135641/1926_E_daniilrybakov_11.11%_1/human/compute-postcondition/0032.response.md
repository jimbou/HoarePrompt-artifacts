Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n_back` is an integer, `m` is 4, `s` is less than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`, `n` is (n + 1) // 4, `k` is greater than the new value of `s`. If `n` is 0, then `s` is equal to the original value of `n_back` and `n` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `s` and `n` remain unchanged.***
