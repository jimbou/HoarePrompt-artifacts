According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to `n_back`, `k` must be greater than 0. `k` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than `n_back`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back, n is 0, m is 2, stdin contains no input, k is greater than n_back**
