Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back plus n, k is greater than n_back, m is four times its original value, n is less than or equal to half of k minus n_back. If n is 0, then n is updated to 1 and s is equal to n_back. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been updated to four times its original value due to the first line of the code. The value of `n` has been updated to less than or equal to half of its original value due to the second line of the code. The value of `s` has been updated to include the new value of `n` due to the third line of the code. All other variables remain unchanged.
