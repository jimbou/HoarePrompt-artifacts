Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, s is equal to (n + 1) // 2, m is 1, n is (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains no input, k is an integer
Code of the loop:
while s < k:
    if n == 0:
        s = n_back
        n = 1
        break
    m *= 2
    n //= 2
    s += n


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back if n is 0, otherwise s is equal to (n + 1) // 2 + n // 2, m is 2, n is (n + 1) // 4, stdin contains no input, k must be greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of s
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, m is 4. If n is 0, then s is equal to n_back and n is 0. Otherwise, s is less than (n + 1) // 2 + n // 2 and n is (n + 1) // 4. k is greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of s.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, m is 8, s is less than the maximum possible odd integer value of s plus n // 2, n is (n + 1) // 4 // 2, k is greater than the new value of s. If n is 0, then s is equal to the original value of n_back and n is 1. Otherwise, the values of s and n remain unchanged.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
