Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, s is equal to (n + 1) // 2, m is 1, n is (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains no input, k is an integer**

The code snippet first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`. Since stdin contains no input, this operation will not affect the state of stdin. The value of `n` becomes the first integer read from stdin, and the value of `k` becomes the second integer read from stdin. 

The second line assigns the value of `n` to `n_back`, so `n_back` becomes equal to the first integer read from stdin.

The third line calculates the value of `(n + 1) // 2` and assigns it to `s`. Since `n` is the first integer read from stdin, `s` becomes equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The fourth line calculates the value of `(n + 1) // 2` and assigns it to `n`. Since `n` is the first integer read from stdin, `n` becomes equal to `(n + 1) // 2`.

The fifth line assigns the value of `1` to `m`, so `m` becomes `1`.

The values of `t` and `_` are not affected by the code snippet, so they remain the same. The value of `k` is also not affected, so it remains an integer.
