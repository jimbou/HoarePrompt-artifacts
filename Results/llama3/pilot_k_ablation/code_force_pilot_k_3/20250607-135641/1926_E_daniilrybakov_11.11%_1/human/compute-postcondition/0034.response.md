Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back if n is 0, otherwise s is equal to k, m is 2^x where x is the number of iterations, n is 0, stdin contains no input, k is an integer**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `s` will be equal to `k` if `n` is not 0, or `n_back` if `n` is 0. The value of `m` will be 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations. The value of `n` will be 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is an integer.
