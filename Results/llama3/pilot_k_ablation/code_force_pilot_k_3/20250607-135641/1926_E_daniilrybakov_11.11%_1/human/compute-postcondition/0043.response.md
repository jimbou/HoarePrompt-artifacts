Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back + 0, m is 2, n is 0, and k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2).**

The code block modifies the values of `m`, `n`, and `s`. The first line doubles the value of `m`, making it 2. The second line halves the value of `n`, making it 0. The third line adds the new value of `n` (0) to `s`, leaving `s` unchanged at `n_back`. The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `k`) remain unaffected by the code block.
