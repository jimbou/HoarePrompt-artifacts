Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 1, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back if n is 0, otherwise s is equal to (n + 1) // 2 + n // 2, m is 2, n is (n + 1) // 4, stdin contains no input, k must be greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of s**

The code block modifies the values of `m`, `n`, and `s`. The first line doubles the value of `m`, making it 2. The second line halves the value of `n`, making it `(n + 1) // 4`. The third line adds the new value of `n` to `s`, making it `(n + 1) // 2 + n // 2`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `k` remain unchanged.
