The variables in the loop head are s and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables s and k. If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is equal to n_back plus n, and k is greater than n_back. For the loop to execute again, s must be less than k, so we need to adjust the state of s and k.

Since s is equal to n_back plus n, we can adjust the state of n_back and n to ensure that s is less than k. We can keep the state of n_back as is, and adjust the state of n to be less than k minus n_back.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back plus n, k is greater than n_back, m is twice its original value, n is less than k minus n_back**
