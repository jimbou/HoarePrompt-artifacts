Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 2, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back, m is 1, n is 1, and k is greater than n_back (and thus at least 2).**

The code snippet modifies the values of `s` and `n`. The first line assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`, effectively updating `s` to be equal to `n_back`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `n`, changing its initial value of 0 to 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n_back`, `m`, and `k`) retain their initial values and conditions, as they are not modified by the code.
