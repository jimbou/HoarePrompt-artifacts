Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, _ is 0, n_back is an integer, s is equal to n_back, n is 1, m is 2, stdin contains no input, k is greater than n_back**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`, but since `s` is already equal to `n_back` in the initial state, this line does not change the value of `s`. The second line assigns the value 1 to `n`, changing its initial value of 0. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `n`, which is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
