Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `_` is 1, `n_back` is an integer, `m` is 2. If `n` is 0, then `s` is equal to `n_back` and `n` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is less than `(n + 1) // 2 + n // 2` and `n` is `(n + 1) // 4`. `k` is greater than the maximum possible odd integer value of `s`.***
