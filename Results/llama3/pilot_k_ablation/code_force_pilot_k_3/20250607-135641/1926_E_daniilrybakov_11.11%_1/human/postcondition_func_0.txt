This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then calculates and prints a value based on these inputs, specifically (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where s and m are determined through a loop that iterates until s is greater than or equal to k. The function processes all test cases and prints the calculated values for each case.
