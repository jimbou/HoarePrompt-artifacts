Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 2, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a` at index 2 and the value is 0, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is set to 0, where `a[i]` is the value of `a` at index 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The `hashing` dictionary is updated with a new key-value pair, where the key is the value of `a` at index 2 and the value is 0.
