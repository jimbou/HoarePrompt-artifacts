Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is 2, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1, a is an empty list, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as an integer greater than 0. The `current_index` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The `results` list remains empty. The `data` list remains unchanged as a list of strings split from the input. The `hashing` dictionary is now empty. The value of `n` is now an integer equal to the value of `data` at index 1. The `a` list is now empty. The `stdin` remains empty.
