Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, t is an integer equal to the number of test cases, current_index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    hashing = {}
    n = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(data[current_index]))
        current_index += 1
    a.sort()
    ans = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if a[i] not in hashing:
            hashing[a[i]] = 0
        hashing[a[i]] += i
        if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
            ans += hashing[a[i]]
    results.append(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+2`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` integer values from `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `a` and the value is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of the key in `a`, and stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element of `a` and its value is the sum of all indices of its occurrences in `a`, `ans` is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and `stdin` is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` three times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `2`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, and `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
