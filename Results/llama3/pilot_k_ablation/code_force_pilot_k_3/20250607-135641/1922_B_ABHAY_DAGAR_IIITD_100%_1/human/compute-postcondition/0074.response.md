Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, current_index is n+n+n+4, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be at least n-1, a is a sorted list containing the integer values of data at indices n+n+4 to n+n+n+3, i is n-1, _ is 2, hashing is an empty dictionary, ans is 0, and stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sorts the list `a` in ascending order, and the second line resets the variable `ans` to 0. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
