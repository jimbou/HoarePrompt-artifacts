Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, current_index is n+n+n+4, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be at least n-1, a is a sorted list containing the integer values of data at indices n+n+4 to n+n+n+3, i is n-1, _ is 2, hashing is an empty dictionary, ans is 0, and stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is 0, `_` is 2, `ans` is 0 + hashing[a[0]], `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the key `a[0]` with value 0, and `hashing[a[0]]` is now 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to 0 + hashing[a[0]].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i+1]`, then `ans` is 0 + hashing[a[0]] + hashing[a[1]], otherwise `ans` is 0 + hashing[a[0]], `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the key `a[0]` with value 0 and the key `a[1]` with value 1, and `hashing[a[0]]` is now 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` is now 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is 2, `_` is 2. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i+1]`, then `ans` is 0 + hashing[a[0]] + hashing[a[1]] + hashing[a[2]] + hashing[a[2]]. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 + hashing[a[0]] + hashing[a[2]] + hashing[a[2]]. `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the key `a[0]` with value 0, the key `a[1]` with value 0, and the key `a[2]` with value 2 + 2, and `hashing[a[0]]` is now 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is now 0, and `hashing[a[2]]` is now 4. If `a[i]` is not in `hashing`, then the postcondition remains the same as the precondition. Otherwise, the postcondition is the same as the if part.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
