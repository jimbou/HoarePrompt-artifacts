Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `ans` is 0 + hashing[a[0]], `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the key `a[0]` with value 0 and the key `a[1]` with value 0, and `hashing[a[0]]` is now 0 and `hashing[a[1]]` is now 0.**

In this output state, the value of `hashing[a[i]]` has been updated to 0, where `a[i]` is `a[1]`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
