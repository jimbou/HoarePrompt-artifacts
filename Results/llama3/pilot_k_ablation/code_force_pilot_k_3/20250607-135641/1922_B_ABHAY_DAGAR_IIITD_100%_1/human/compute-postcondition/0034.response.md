Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+3, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2, a is an empty list, i is n-1, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, _ is 1, and stdin is empty.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `current_index`, `a`, and `hashing`. The first line reassigns an empty dictionary to `hashing`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The second line updates the value of `n` to the integer value of `data` at index `current_index`, which is `n+2`. The third line increments `current_index` by 1, making it `n+3`. The fourth line reassigns an empty list to `a`, effectively clearing its previous contents. The values of `t`, `results`, `data`, `i`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged.
