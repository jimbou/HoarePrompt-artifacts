Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is 5, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, hashing is an empty dictionary, n must be greater than 2, a is a list containing three integer values from data, i is 2, stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer value at the current_index in the data list to the list a. Since current_index is 4, the integer value at index 4 in the data list is appended to a. The second line increments the current_index by 1, making it 5. No other variables are affected by the code.
