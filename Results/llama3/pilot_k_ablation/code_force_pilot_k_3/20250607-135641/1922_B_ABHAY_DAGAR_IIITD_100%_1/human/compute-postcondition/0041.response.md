Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+n+3, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be greater than n-1, a is a list containing the integer value of data at index n+3, the integer value of data at index n+4, the integer value of data at index n+5, ..., the integer value of data at index n+n+2, i is n-1, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, _ is 1, and stdin is empty.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The current_index has been incremented n times, and the list a now contains the integer values of data at indices n+3 to n+n+2. The variable i has been incremented n-1 times, and the variable n is still equal to the value of data at index n+2, but it must be greater than n-1. The other variables remain unchanged.
