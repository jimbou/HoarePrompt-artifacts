Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+4, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be greater than 0, a is a list containing the integer value of data at index n+3, i is 0, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, _ is 1, and stdin is empty**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the integer value of `data` at index `current_index` to the list `a`. Since `current_index` is `n+3`, the value of `data` at index `n+3` is appended to `a`. The second line increments `current_index` by 1, making it `n+4`. No other variables are affected by the code.
