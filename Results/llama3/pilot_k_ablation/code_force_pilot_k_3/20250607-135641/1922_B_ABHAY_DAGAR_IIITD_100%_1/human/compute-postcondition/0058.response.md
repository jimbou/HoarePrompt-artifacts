Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 4, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, `i` is `n - 1`, `_` is 1, `hashing[a[n]]` is increased by `n`, if `a[n]` is not in the hashing dictionary, then `hashing` is a dictionary where `a[n]` is a key with value `n`. If `a[n]` is equal to `a[n + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary for the key `a[n]` plus the value of hashing dictionary for the key `a[n]`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary for the key `a[n]`. `hashing[a[i]]` is 0.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `hashing[a[i]]`, which is now set to 0. The value of `a[i]` is the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, since `i` is `n - 1` and `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+3` to `n+n+2`.
