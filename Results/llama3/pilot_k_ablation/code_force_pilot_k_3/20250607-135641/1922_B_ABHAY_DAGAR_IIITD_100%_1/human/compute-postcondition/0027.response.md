Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 2, and stdin is empty. If the value of `a` at index 2 is not in the `hashing` dictionary, then `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a` at index 2 and the value is 0.***
