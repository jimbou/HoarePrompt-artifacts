Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `hashing` is a dictionary with `a[i]` as a key and 0 as its value, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `stdin` is empty, and the current value of `a[i]` is in the `hashing` dictionary with a value of 0.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `hashing` dictionary now contains `a[i]` as a key with a value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged. The `hashing` dictionary now maps the current value of `a[i]` to 0, indicating that this value has been processed.
