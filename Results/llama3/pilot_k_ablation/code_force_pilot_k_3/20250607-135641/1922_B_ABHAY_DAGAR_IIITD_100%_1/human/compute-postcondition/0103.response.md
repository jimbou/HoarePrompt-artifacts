According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results. If the results have at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least one element which is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a t times, result is the first element in the list results, and the first element of the list results which is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a is being printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the results must have at least 2 elements and the result is the second element in the list results.
State: **`t` is 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and `result` is the second element in the list `results`**
