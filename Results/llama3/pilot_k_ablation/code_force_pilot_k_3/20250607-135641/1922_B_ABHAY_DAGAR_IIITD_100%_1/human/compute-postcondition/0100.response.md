To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `result` and the list `results`. The loop will execute if `results` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `results` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`t` is 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing at least one element which is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and `result` is the first element in the list `results`**
