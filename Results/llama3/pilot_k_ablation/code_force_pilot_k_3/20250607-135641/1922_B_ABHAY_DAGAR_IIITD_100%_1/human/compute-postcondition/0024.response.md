Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 1, and stdin is empty. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary with the smallest integer in `a` as a key plus the value of hashing dictionary with `a[i]` as a key, and the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in the hashing dictionary, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to 0 and `ans` is increased by 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
