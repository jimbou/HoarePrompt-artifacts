Output State: `t` is an integer equal to 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, and `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and stdin is empty.

This output state represents the final state of the program after the loop has executed all its iterations. The loop has processed all the test cases, and the results are stored in the `results` list. The `current_index` has moved to the end of the `data` list, and the `n` variable holds the value of the last test case. The `a` list contains the sorted integers from the last test case, and the `hashing` dictionary contains the indices of the occurrences of each integer in the last test case. The `ans` variable holds the sum of the values of the `hashing` dictionary for the last test case. The stdin is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
