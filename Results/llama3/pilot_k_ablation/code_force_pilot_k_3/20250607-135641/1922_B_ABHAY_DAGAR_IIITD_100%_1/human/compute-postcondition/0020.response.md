Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 1, `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary with the smallest integer in `a` as a key if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, `hashing[a[i]]` is 0, and stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `hashing[a[i]]` has been updated to 0, where `a[i]` is the second smallest integer in the sorted list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
