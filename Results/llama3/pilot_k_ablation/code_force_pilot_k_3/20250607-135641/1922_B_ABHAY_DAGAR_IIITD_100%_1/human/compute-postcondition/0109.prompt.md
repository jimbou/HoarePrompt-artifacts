Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, and `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`.
Code of the loop:
for result in results:
    print(result)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing at least one element which is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and `result` is the first element in the list `results`, and the first element of the list `results` which is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing at least 2 elements which are the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and `result` is the second element in the list `results` and the second element in the list `results` which is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t+1`, `results` is a list containing at least 3 elements which are the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t+1 times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t+1` to `n+n+...+n+t+n`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and the third element in the list `results` which is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
