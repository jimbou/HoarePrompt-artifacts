Output State: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 2, `ans` is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]`, `a[1]`, ..., `a[n-1]` with values 0, 1, ..., n-1 respectively, and `hashing[a[0]]` is now 0, `hashing[a[1]]` is now 1, ..., `hashing[a[n-1]]` is now n-1. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`.


In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final state. The variable `i` has reached its maximum value of `n-1`, and the dictionary `hashing` now contains all the keys from `a[0]` to `a[n-1]` with their corresponding values. The variable `ans` has been updated to the sum of the values of the hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
