To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `t` and the loop counter `_` (although `_` is not explicitly mentioned, it is implied as the loop variable).

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1.

Since we don't know the exact value of `t`, we can't determine the exact value of `_` at the start of the next iteration. However, we can express the state of `_` in terms of `t`.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+2`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` integer values from `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `a` and the value is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of the key in `a`, `_` is 1, and stdin is empty.**

Note that I've assumed that `_` starts at 0, which is a common convention in Python. If `_` starts at a different value, the state would need to be adjusted accordingly.
