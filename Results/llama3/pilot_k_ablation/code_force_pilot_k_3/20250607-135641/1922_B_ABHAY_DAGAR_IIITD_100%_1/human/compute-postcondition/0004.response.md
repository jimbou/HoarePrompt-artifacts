Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is 3, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, hashing is an empty dictionary, n must be greater than 0, a is a list containing one integer value from data, i is 0, stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the values of `current_index` and `a`. The first line appends an integer value from `data` at the index `current_index` to the list `a`. Since `current_index` is initially 2, the integer value at index 2 in `data` is appended to `a`. The second line increments `current_index` by 1, making it 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
