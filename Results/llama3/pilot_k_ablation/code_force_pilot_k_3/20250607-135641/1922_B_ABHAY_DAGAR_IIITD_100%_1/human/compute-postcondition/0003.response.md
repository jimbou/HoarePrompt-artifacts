According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index 1, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
