Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, current_index is n+n+4, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be at least n-1, a is an empty list, i is n-1, _ is 2, hashing is an empty dictionary, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, and stdin is empty**

The code snippet modifies the values of `n`, `current_index`, `a`, and `hashing`. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of `data` at index `current_index`, which is `n+n+3`. The value of `current_index` is incremented by 1, making it `n+n+4`. The list `a` is reset to an empty list. The dictionary `hashing` is also reset to an empty dictionary. The values of `t`, `results`, `data`, `i`, `_`, `ans`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
