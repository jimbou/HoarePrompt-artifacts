Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+5, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be greater than 1, a is a list containing the integer value of data at index n+3 and the integer value of data at index n+4, i is 1, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, hashing is an empty dictionary, _ is 1, and stdin is empty**

The code appends the integer value of `data` at index `current_index` (which is `n+4`) to the list `a`, and then increments `current_index` by 1. As a result, `a` now contains the integer value of `data` at index `n+3` and the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, and `current_index` is now `n+5`. All other variables remain unchanged.
