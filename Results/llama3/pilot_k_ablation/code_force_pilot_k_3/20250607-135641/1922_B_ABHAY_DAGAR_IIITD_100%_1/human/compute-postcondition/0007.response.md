The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `n` must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing two integer values from data, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty**
