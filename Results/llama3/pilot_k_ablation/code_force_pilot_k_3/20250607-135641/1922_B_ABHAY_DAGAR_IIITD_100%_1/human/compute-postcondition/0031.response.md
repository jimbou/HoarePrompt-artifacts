Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+2, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1, a is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, i is n-1, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, hashing is a dictionary where the key is an integer from a and the value is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of the key in a, and stdin is empty.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the variables `t`, `current_index`, `results`, `data`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The variable `n` is still equal to the value of `data` at index 1, and `a` is still a sorted list containing `n` integer values from `data`. The variable `i` has reached its final value of `n-1`. The variable `ans` has been updated to be the sum of the values of the `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`. The `hashing` dictionary now contains all the integers from `a` as keys, and the value for each key is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of the key in `a`.
