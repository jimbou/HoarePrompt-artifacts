Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is 1, `hashing` is a dictionary where each key is an element of `a` and its value is the sum of all indices of its occurrences in `a`, `ans` is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The variables `t`, `current_index`, `results`, `data`, `n`, `a`, and `_` remain unchanged.
*   The variable `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n-1` times.
*   The `hashing` dictionary now contains each element of `a` as a key, and its value is the sum of all indices of its occurrences in `a`.
*   The variable `ans` now contains the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`.
