Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, current_index is n+n+6, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be at least 2, a is a list containing the integer value of data at index n+n+4 and the integer value of data at index n+n+5, i is 1, _ is 2, hashing is an empty dictionary, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, and stdin is empty**

The code block modifies the `a` list by appending the integer value of `data` at index `current_index`, which is `n+n+5`. This means that `a` now contains two integer values: the original value at index `n+n+4` and the new value at index `n+n+5`. The `current_index` variable is incremented by 1, making it `n+n+6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
