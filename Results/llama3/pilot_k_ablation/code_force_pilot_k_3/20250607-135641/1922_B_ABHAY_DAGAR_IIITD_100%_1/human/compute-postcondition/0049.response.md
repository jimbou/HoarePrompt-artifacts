Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary for the key `a[i]`, `hashing` is a dictionary where `a[i]` is a key with value `i` or `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary with its value incremented by `i`, `_` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by the value of the `hashing` dictionary for the key `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is `i` or `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary with its value incremented by `i`. Therefore, the value of `ans` is now equal to the value of `hashing` dictionary for the key `a[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
