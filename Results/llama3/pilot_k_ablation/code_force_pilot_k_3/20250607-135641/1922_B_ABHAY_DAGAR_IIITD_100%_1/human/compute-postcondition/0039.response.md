To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+5`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be greater than 2, `a` is a list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3` and the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, `i` is 2, `ans` is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `hashing` is an empty dictionary, `_` is 1, and `stdin` is empty**
