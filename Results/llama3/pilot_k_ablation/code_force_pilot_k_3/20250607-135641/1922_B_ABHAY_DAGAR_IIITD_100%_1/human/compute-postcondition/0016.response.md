Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` dictionary has the smallest integer in `a` as a key with the same value as before, and stdin is empty. The current value of `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`***
