Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, if `a[i]` is not in the hashing dictionary, then `hashing` is a dictionary where `a[i]` is a key with value 0. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary for the key `a[i]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `i` is `n`, `_` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.***
