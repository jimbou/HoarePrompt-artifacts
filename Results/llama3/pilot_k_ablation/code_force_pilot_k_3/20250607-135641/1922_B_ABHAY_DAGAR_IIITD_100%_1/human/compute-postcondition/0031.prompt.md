Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+2, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1, a is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, i is n-1, ans is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n - 1):
    if a[i] not in hashing:
        hashing[a[i]] = 0
    hashing[a[i]] += i
    if a[i] == a[i + 1]:
        ans += hashing[a[i]]


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 0, `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary with the smallest integer in `a` as a key if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, and stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 1, and stdin is empty. If `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary with the smallest integer in `a` as a key plus the value of hashing dictionary with `a[i]` as a key, and the value of `hashing[a[i]]` is increased by 1. If `a[i]` is not in the hashing dictionary, then `hashing[a[i]]` is set to 0 and `ans` is increased by 0. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i + 1]`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 2, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a` at index 2 and the value is 2. If the value of `a` at index `i` is equal to the value of `a` at index `i+1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing` at key `a[i]` which is 2.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
