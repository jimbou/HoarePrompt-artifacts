Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, `i` is 0, `ans` is 0, `hashing` is a dictionary where `a[i]` is a key with value 0, and `_` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, the `current_index` remains the same, the `results` list is unchanged, the `data` list is unchanged, the value of `n` is still equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and is at least 2, the `a` list is unchanged, the value of `i` is still 0, the value of `ans` is still 0, the `hashing` dictionary now has `a[i]` as a key with a value of 0, and the value of `_` is still 1. The `stdin` is still empty.
