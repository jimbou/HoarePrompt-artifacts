To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. Since `i` is 0, we can increment it by 1 to make it 1. Now, `i` is 1.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is 1, `_` is 2, `ans` is 0 + hashing[a[0]], `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the key `a[0]` with value 0, and `hashing[a[0]]` is now 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `ans` is updated to 0 + hashing[a[0]].**
