Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+2, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1, a is a list containing n integer values from data, i is n-1, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer greater than 0, `current_index` has incremented by `n` (the number of iterations), `results` and `hashing` remain empty, `data` remains unchanged, `n` remains the same, `a` now contains `n` integer values from `data`, and `i` has reached `n-1`. The `stdin` remains empty.
