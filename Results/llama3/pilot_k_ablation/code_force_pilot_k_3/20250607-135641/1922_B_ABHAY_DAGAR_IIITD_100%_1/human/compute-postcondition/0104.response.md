The code prints the second element in the list `results`.
Since the exact values of `hashing` dictionary and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the second element in the list `results`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times.
Output: **the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a t times (where t is the value of t)**
