Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+2`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index 1, `a` is a sorted list containing `n` integer values from `data`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is an integer from `a` and the value is the sum of the indices of all occurrences of the key in `a`, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `results` now contains the sum of the values of the `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
