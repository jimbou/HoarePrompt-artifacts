Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+n+3, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be greater than n-1, a is a sorted list containing the integer value of data at index n+3, the integer value of data at index n+4, the integer value of data at index n+5, ..., the integer value of data at index n+n+2, i is n-1, ans is 0, hashing is an empty dictionary, _ is 1, and stdin is empty.**

The code first sorts the list `a` in ascending order, modifying its original state. The second line resets the value of `ans` to 0, overwriting its previous value. No other variables are affected by the code.
