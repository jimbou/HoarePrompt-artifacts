Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` three times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `2`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, and `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains an integer greater than 1. The value of `current_index` remains `n+n+n+4`. The list `results` now contains the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` three times. The list `data` remains the same. The value of `n` remains an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least `n-1`. The list `a` remains the same. The value of `i` remains `n-1`. The value of `_` remains `2`. The dictionary `hashing` remains the same. The value of `ans` remains the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`.
