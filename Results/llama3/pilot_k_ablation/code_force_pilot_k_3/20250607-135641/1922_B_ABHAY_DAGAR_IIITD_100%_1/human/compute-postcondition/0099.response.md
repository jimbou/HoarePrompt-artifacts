Output State: **`t` is 0, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, and `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `t` times, and the variables have been updated accordingly. The `current_index` has been incremented by `n` for each iteration, and the `results` list contains the sum of the values of the `hashing` dictionary for each iteration. The `n` variable has been updated to the value of `data` at the current index, and the `a` list contains the sorted integer values from `data` at the current index. The `i` variable is still `n-1`, and the `_` variable is `t-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The `hashing` dictionary contains the keys and values from the last iteration, and the `ans` variable contains the sum of the values of the `hashing` dictionary for the last iteration.
