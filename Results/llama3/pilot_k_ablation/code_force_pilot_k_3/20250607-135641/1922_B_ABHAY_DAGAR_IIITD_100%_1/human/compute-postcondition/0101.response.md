The code prints the first element in the list `results`, which is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times.

Since `t` is 0, the sum is calculated for `a` 0 times, which means the sum is calculated for the initial state of `a`.

The `hashing` dictionary contains keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`. The sum of these values is `0 + 1 + ... + (n-2)`, which is a known arithmetic series summing to `(n-2)*(n-1)/2`.

However, the problem statement does not provide the exact value of `n`, so we cannot compute the exact numerical value of the sum.

Output: **(n-2)*(n-1)/2 (where n is the value of data at index n+n+...+n+t-1)**
