Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `current_index` is `n+n+n+4`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 2, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+4` to `n+n+n+3`, `i` is 0, `_` is 2, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the key `a[0]` with value 0, and `ans` is 0, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `hashing` dictionary now contains the key `a[0]` with value 0, where `a[0]` is the first element of the sorted list `a`. All other variables remain unchanged.
