Output State: **`t` is the length of `results` minus 1, `current_index` is `n+n+...+n+t`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` t times, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+n+...+n+t-1` and must be at least `n-1`, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer values of `data` at indices `n+n+...+n+t` to `n+n+...+n+t+n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `_` is `t-1`, `hashing` is a dictionary that contains the keys `a[0]` to `a[n-2]` with values `0` to `n-2`, `ans` is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, and the last element in the list `results` which is the sum of the values of `hashing` dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a` is being printed.**

The loop has executed all its iterations, printing each element in the `results` list, which contains the sum of the values of the `hashing` dictionary for all keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, for each iteration. The loop has finished executing, and the final state reflects the completion of the loop's iterations.
