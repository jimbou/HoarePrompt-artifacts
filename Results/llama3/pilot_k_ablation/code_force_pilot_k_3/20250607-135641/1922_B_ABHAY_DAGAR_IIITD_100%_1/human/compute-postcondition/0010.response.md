The first line sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since `a` contains `n` integer values from `data`, the sorted list will be in non-decreasing order. The second line initializes the variable `ans` to 0. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is n+2, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, hashing is an empty dictionary, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1, a is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, i is n-1, ans is 0, stdin is empty**
