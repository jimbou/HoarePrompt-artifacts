The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1, current_index is n+n+6, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be at least 3, a is a list containing the integer value of data at index n+n+4 and the integer value of data at index n+n+5, i is 2, _ is 2, hashing is an empty dictionary, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, and stdin is empty**
