Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, current_index is n+n+n+4, results is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a and the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, data is a list of strings split from the input, n is an integer equal to the value of data at index n+2 and must be at least n-1, a is a list containing the integer values of data at indices n+n+4 to n+n+n+3, i is n-1, _ is 2, hashing is an empty dictionary, ans is the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in a, and stdin is empty**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, and the variables affected by the loop have reached their final values. The list 'a' now contains the integer values of data at indices n+n+4 to n+n+n+3, and the variable 'i' has reached the value n-1. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
