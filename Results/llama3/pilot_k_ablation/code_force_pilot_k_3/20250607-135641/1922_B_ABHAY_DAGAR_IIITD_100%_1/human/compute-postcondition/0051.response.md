The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be increased by 1 for `i` to be less than `n-1`. So `i` is `n` and `n` is at least 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, then `i` is 0 and `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary for the key `a[i]`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `hashing` is a dictionary where `a[i]` is a key with value `i` or `a[i]` is already a key in the dictionary with its value incremented by `i`, `_` is 1, and `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`**
