To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `_` (a throwaway variable) and `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin is empty, t is an integer greater than 0, current_index is 1, results is an empty list, data is a list of strings split from the input, input is a function that reads from sys.stdin**
