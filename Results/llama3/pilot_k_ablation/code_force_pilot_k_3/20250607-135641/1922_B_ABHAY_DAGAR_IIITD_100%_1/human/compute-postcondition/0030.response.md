Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 2, `hashing` is a dictionary where the key is the value of `a` at index 2 and the value is 2. If the value of `a` at index `i` is equal to the value of `a` at index `i+1`, then `ans` is increased by the value of `hashing` at key `a[i]` which is 2.***
