To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(n - 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index 1 and must be at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `n` must be at least 3, we can conclude that `n` is still at least 3.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `current_index`, `results`, `data`, `a`, `ans`, and `hashing`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is n+2, `results` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of data at index 1 and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing n integer values from data, `i` is 2, and stdin is empty.**
