Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `current_index` is `n+n+3`, `results` is a list containing the sum of the values of hashing dictionary for all the keys that have at least two consecutive occurrences in `a`, `data` is a list of strings split from the input, `n` is an integer equal to the value of `data` at index `n+2` and must be at least 3, `a` is a sorted list containing the integer value of `data` at index `n+3`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+4`, the integer value of `data` at index `n+5`, ..., the integer value of `data` at index `n+n+2`, `hashing` is a dictionary where `a[i]` is a key with value 0, `i` is `n`, `ans` is equal to the value of hashing dictionary for the key `a[i]` if `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, `_` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `hashing[a[i]]` has been updated to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `ans` is still dependent on whether `a[i]` is equal to `a[i + 1]`. If they are equal, `ans` is equal to the value of the hashing dictionary for the key `a[i]`, which is now 0. If they are not equal, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.
