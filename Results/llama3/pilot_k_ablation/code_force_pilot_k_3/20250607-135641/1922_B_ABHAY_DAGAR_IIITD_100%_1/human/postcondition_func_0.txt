This function reads input from standard input, processes it, and prints the results. It expects the input to contain multiple test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains the number of integers in the test case, and the second line contains the integers themselves. The function sorts the integers in each test case, counts the number of consecutive occurrences of each integer, and calculates the sum of the indices of these occurrences. It then prints the sum for each test case. The function does not modify the input data and does not have any side effects other than printing the results.
