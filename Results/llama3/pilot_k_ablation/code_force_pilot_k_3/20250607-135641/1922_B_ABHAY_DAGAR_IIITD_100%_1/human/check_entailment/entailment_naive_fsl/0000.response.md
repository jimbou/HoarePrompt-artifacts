Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them. The issue lies in the fact that the program only considers the case where the three sticks have the same length, but it does not consider the case where the three sticks have different lengths.

For example, if the input is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the program will not correctly calculate the number of ways to choose three sticks to form a triangle. The program will only consider the case where the three sticks have the same length, which is not possible in this case.

A correct program should consider all possible combinations of three sticks, not just the ones with the same length. It should also check if the three sticks can form a triangle by checking if the sum of the lengths of any two sticks is greater than the length of the third stick.

Here is a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    current_index = 0
    t = int(data[current_index])
    current_index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[current_index])
        current_index += 1
        a = []
        for i in range(n):
            a.append(int(data[current_index]))
            current_index += 1
        a.sort()
        ans = 0
        for i in range(n - 2):
            for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
                for k in range(j + 1, n):
                    if a[i] + a[j] > a[k] and a[i] + a[k] > a[j] and a[j] + a[k] > a[i]:
                        ans += 1
        results.append(ans)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the number of ways to choose exactly 3 sticks so that a triangle can be formed out of them by considering all possible combinations of three sticks and checking if they can form a triangle.
