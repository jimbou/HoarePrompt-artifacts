This function calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a variable 'r' based on the input parameters 'n' and 'k', where 'n' is a positive integer and 'k' is a non-negative integer less than 'n'. The function constructs a graph from a list of edges and uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of 'r' that satisfies a certain condition. The function prints the calculated value of 'r', which can be either 'n // k' or '(n // k) // 2', depending on the condition.
