Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

 Output hints for function1:  This function calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a variable 'r' based on the input parameters 'n' and 'k', where 'n' is a positive integer and 'k' is a non-negative integer less than 'n'. The function constructs a graph from a list of edges and uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of 'r' that satisfies a certain condition. The function prints the calculated value of 'r', which can be either 'n // k' or '(n // k) // 2', depending on the condition.

 Output hints for function2:  Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node 'x', and returns a tuple containing two values: 'c' and 'r'. 'c' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value less than the given non-negative integer 'y', plus one. 'r' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value greater than or equal to 'y', plus the sum of 'r' values from recursive DFS calls on neighboring nodes. The function also marks all visited nodes in the 'visited' set.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def check(x):
    visited.clear()
    (ans, r) = dfs(1, x)
    if ans >= x and r >= k:

''' 

 Output hints for function3:  This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. It takes no parameters but uses external variables x, visited, k, and a function dfs. It clears the visited set, performs the DFS, and checks if the returned values meet a specific condition (ans >= x and r >= k). If the condition is met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function's purpose is to evaluate the outcome of the DFS operation and provide a boolean result indicating whether the condition is satisfied.
