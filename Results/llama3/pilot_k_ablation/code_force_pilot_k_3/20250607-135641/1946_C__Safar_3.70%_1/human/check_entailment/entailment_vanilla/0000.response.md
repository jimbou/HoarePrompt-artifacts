Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from a tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first constructs an adjacency list representation of the tree using the given edges.

2. It then defines a binary search function `func_1` that takes the number of vertices `n`, the number of edges to be removed `k`, and the edges of the tree as input. The function performs a binary search over the range `[1, n // k + 1]` to find the maximum value of x.

3. Within the binary search function, the program calls the `check` function to determine if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least the current mid value.

4. The `check` function uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree. It keeps track of the number of visited nodes and the number of edges that need to be removed to ensure that each connected component has at least x nodes.

5. The DFS function `dfs` returns the number of nodes in the current connected component and the number of edges that need to be removed. If the number of nodes is greater than or equal to x, it increments the count of edges to be removed.

6. The `check` function returns True if it is possible to remove exactly k edges such that each connected component has at least x nodes, and False otherwise.

7. The binary search function updates the search range based on the result of the `check` function and repeats the process until it finds the maximum value of x.

8. Finally, the program prints the maximum value of x for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
