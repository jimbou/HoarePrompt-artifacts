Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given a tree with n vertices.

Your task is to find the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove
exactly k edges from this tree in such a way that the size of each remaining
connected component^{\dagger} is at least x .

^{\dagger} Two vertices v and u are in the same connected component if there
exists a sequence of numbers t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k of arbitrary length k ,
such that t_1 = v , t_k = u , and for each i from 1 to k - 1 , vertices t_i
and t_{i+1} are connected by an edge.

Input

Each test consists of several sets of input data. The first line contains a
single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of sets of input data. This
is followed by a description of the sets of input data.

The first line of each set of input data contains two integers n and k (1 \le
k < n \le 10^5 ) — the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges
to be removed.

Each of the next n - 1 lines of each set of input data contains two integers v
and u (1 \le v, u \le n ) — the next edge of the tree.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all sets of input data
does not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each set of input data, output a single line containing the maximum number
x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a
way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x .

Note

The tree in the first set of input data:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/799bacd3be0dda357800fdfc3eadbf38ab259c51.png)

After removing the edge 1 — 3 , the tree will look as follows:

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/a59ae10eeac1212e1e56fc7fe5f6a47764269104.png)

The tree has split into two connected components. The first component consists
of two vertices: 1 and 2 . The second connected component consists of three
vertices: 3, 4 and 5 . In both connected components, there are at least two
vertices. It can be shown that the answer 3 is not achievable, so the answer
is 2 .

# Annotated Functions:
q = []
for i in range(int(input())):
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split(' '))
    edges = []
    for _ in range(n - 1):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split(' '))
        edges.append((a, b))
    if i == 325:
        print(n, k, edges)
    func_1(n, k, edges)
for (n, k, edges) in q:
    func_1(n, k, edges)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, and edges is a list of pairs of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive) and represents an edge in the tree.
    g = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for (a, b) in edges:
        g[a].append(b)
        
        g[b].append(a)
        
    #State: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, a is the first integer in the last pair of edges, b is the second integer in the last pair of edges, g is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b len(edges) times and the list at index b contains a len(edges) times.
    c = 0
    visited = set()
    l = 1
    r = n // k + 1
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r - l) // 2
        
        if check(mid):
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1
        
    #State: l is n // k + 1 and r is n // k when check(mid) is true. l is 1 and r is (n // k) // 2 when check(mid) is false.
    print(r)
    #This is printed: n // k or (n // k) // 2 (where n and k are the values used to calculate l and r, and check(mid) is the condition that determines which value of r is printed)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a variable 'r' based on the input parameters 'n' and 'k', where 'n' is a positive integer and 'k' is a non-negative integer less than 'n'. The function constructs a graph from a list of edges and uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of 'r' that satisfies a certain condition. The function prints the calculated value of 'r', which can be either 'n // k' or '(n // k) // 2', depending on the condition.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, and visited is a set of visited nodes.
    c = 1
    r = 0
    visited.add(x)
    for node in g[x]:
        if node not in visited:
            ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
            r += rn
            if ans >= y:
                r += 1
            else:
                c += ans
        
    #State: x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all nodes visited by dfs(node, y) for all nodes in g[x], c is 1 plus the sum of ans for all nodes in g[x] where ans is less than y, r is the original value of r plus the sum of rn for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where ans is greater than or equal to y.
    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of ans for all nodes in g[x] where ans is less than y, and r is the original value of r plus the sum of rn for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where ans is greater than or equal to y.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node 'x', and returns a tuple containing two values: 'c' and 'r'. 'c' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value less than the given non-negative integer 'y', plus one. 'r' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value greater than or equal to 'y', plus the sum of 'r' values from recursive DFS calls on neighboring nodes. The function also marks all visited nodes in the 'visited' set.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer, visited is a set of integers, k is a positive integer, and dfs is a function that takes two parameters and returns a tuple of two values, where the first value is a boolean and the second value is an integer.
    visited.clear()
    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, which is a boolean value.
    #State: *x is a positive integer, visited is an empty set, k is a positive integer, ans is a boolean, and r is an integer. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k.
    return False
    #The program returns False, which is a boolean value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. It takes no parameters but uses external variables x, visited, k, and a function dfs. It clears the visited set, performs the DFS, and checks if the returned values meet a specific condition (ans >= x and r >= k). If the condition is met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function's purpose is to evaluate the outcome of the DFS operation and provide a boolean result indicating whether the condition is satisfied.
