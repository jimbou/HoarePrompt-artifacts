#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the maximum possible value of a variable 'r' based on the input parameters 'n' and 'k', where 'n' is a positive integer and 'k' is a non-negative integer less than 'n'. The function constructs a graph from a list of edges and uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of 'r' that satisfies a certain condition. The function prints the calculated value of 'r', which can be either 'n // k' or '(n // k) // 2', depending on the condition.

    return c, r
    #The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of ans for all nodes in g[x] where ans is less than y, and r is the original value of r plus the sum of rn for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where ans is greater than or equal to y.

#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node 'x', and returns a tuple containing two values: 'c' and 'r'. 'c' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value less than the given non-negative integer 'y', plus one. 'r' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value greater than or equal to 'y', plus the sum of 'r' values from recursive DFS calls on neighboring nodes. The function also marks all visited nodes in the 'visited' set.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a positive integer, visited is a set of integers, k is a positive integer, and dfs is a function that takes two parameters and returns a tuple of two values, where the first value is a boolean and the second value is an integer.

    ans, r = dfs(1, x)
    if (ans >= x and r >= k) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, which is a boolean value.
    #State: *x is a positive integer, visited is an empty set, k is a positive integer, ans is a boolean, and r is an integer. Either ans is less than x or r is less than k.
    return False
    #The program returns False, which is a boolean value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether a certain condition is met based on the results of a depth-first search (DFS) operation. It takes no parameters but uses external variables x, visited, k, and a function dfs. It clears the visited set, performs the DFS, and checks if the returned values meet a specific condition (ans >= x and r >= k). If the condition is met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function's purpose is to evaluate the outcome of the DFS operation and provide a boolean result indicating whether the condition is satisfied.
