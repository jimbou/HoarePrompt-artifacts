Postcondition: ***x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x and all nodes visited by dfs(node, y), g[x] must not be empty, node is the first node in g[x], and the current value of node is in the set of visited nodes. If ans is greater than or equal to y, then c is 1 and r is the original value of r plus the return value of rn from dfs(node, y) plus 1. If ans is less than y, then c is 1 plus ans and r is the original value of r plus the return value of rn from dfs(node, y).***
