Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer such that k < n, edges is an empty list, a is the first integer in the last pair of edges, b is the second integer in the last pair of edges, g is a list of n+1 lists where the list at index a contains b len(edges) times and the list at index b contains a len(edges) times, c is 0, visited is an empty set, l is 1, r is n // k + 1.
Code of the loop:
while l <= r:
    mid = l + (r - l) // 2
    if check(mid):
        l = mid + 1
    else:
        r = mid - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer in the last pair of edges, `b` is the second integer in the last pair of edges, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` `len(edges)` times and the list at index `b` contains `a` `len(edges)` times, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set. If `check(mid)` is True, then `l` is `1 + (n // k) // 2 + 1` and `r` is `n // k + 1`. Otherwise, `l` is 1 and `r` is `(n // k) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n`, `edges` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer in the last pair of edges, `b` is the second integer in the last pair of edges, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` `len(edges)` times and the list at index `b` contains `a` `len(edges)` times, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is `mid + 1` which is `l + (r - l) // 2 + 1` or `mid + 1` is 2 + (n // k) // 2 + 1 or `mid + 1` is 2, and `r` is `n // k + 1` or `r` is `(n // k) // 2`. Otherwise, `l` is 1 + (n // k) // 2 + 1 and `r` is `mid - 1` or `l` is 1 and `r` is `(n // k) // 2. In both cases, `mid` is `l + (r - l) // 2`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n` and `n // k` is greater than or equal to 2, `edges` is an empty list, `a` is the first integer in the last pair of edges, `b` is the second integer in the last pair of edges, `g` is a list of `n+1` lists where the list at index `a` contains `b` `len(edges)` times and the list at index `b` contains `a` `len(edges)` times, `c` is 0, `visited` is an empty set. If `check(mid)` is true, then `l` is `mid + 1` and `r` is either `n // k + 1` or `(n // k) // 2` or `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `r` is either `(mid + 1 + (n // k + 1 - (mid + 1)) // 2) - 1` or `(1 + (n // k) // 2 + 1 + (n // k + 1 - (1 + (n // k) // 2 + 1)) // 2) - 1` or `(1 + ((n // k) // 2 - 1) // 2) - 1` and `l` is either `mid + 1` or `1 + (n // k) // 2 + 1` or `1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
