To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `node` and `g[x]`.

According to the code, the loop iterates over the nodes in `g[x]`. At the end of the previous iteration, `node` is the second node in `g[x]`, and `g[x]` must have at least two nodes. For the loop to execute again, `g[x]` must have at least three nodes, and `node` should be the third node in `g[x]`.

State: **x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third node in g[x], g[x] must have at least three nodes**
