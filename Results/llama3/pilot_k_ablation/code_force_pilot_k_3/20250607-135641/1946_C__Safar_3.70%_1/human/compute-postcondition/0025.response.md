Functionality: This function performs a depth-first search (DFS) on a tree, starting from a given node 'x', and returns a tuple containing two values: 'c' and 'r'. 'c' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value less than the given non-negative integer 'y', plus one. 'r' represents the count of nodes in the subtree rooted at 'x' that have a value greater than or equal to 'y', plus the sum of 'r' values from recursive DFS calls on neighboring nodes. The function also marks all visited nodes in the 'visited' set.
