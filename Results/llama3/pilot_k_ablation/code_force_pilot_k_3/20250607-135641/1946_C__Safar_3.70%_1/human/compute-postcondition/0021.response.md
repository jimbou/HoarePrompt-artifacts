Postcondition: ***x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third node in g[x], g[x] must have at least three nodes. If node is not in visited, then ans is the result of dfs(node, y), rn is the return value of dfs(node, y). If ans is greater than or equal to y, r is increased by 1 plus the return value of dfs(node, y). Otherwise, r is increased by the return value of dfs(node, y) and c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y). If node is in visited, no changes are made.***
