Postcondition: ***x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the second node in g[x], g[x] must have at least two nodes. If node is not in visited, then the function performs a depth-first search on node with y, and updates r and c accordingly based on the result of the search. If node is in visited, then no action is taken.***
