Output State: **l is n // k + 1 and r is n // k when check(mid) is true. l is 1 and r is (n // k) // 2 when check(mid) is false.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `l` is `n // k + 1` and the value of `r` is `n // k` when `check(mid)` is true. When `check(mid)` is false, the value of `l` is 1 and the value of `r` is `(n // k) // 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
