Output State: **`x` is a node in a tree, `y` is a non-negative integer, `g` is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, `visited` is a set of visited nodes containing `x`, `node` is the third node in `g[x]`, `g[x]` must have at least three nodes, `ans` is the result of `dfs(node, y)`, `r` is increased by the return value of `dfs(node, y)`, `rn` is the return value of `dfs(node, y)`, `c` is increased by the result of `dfs(node, y)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `x`, `y`, `g`, `visited`, `node`, `ans`, `r`, `rn` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `c` is increased by the result of the function `dfs(node, y)`, which is stored in `ans` and also in `rn`.
