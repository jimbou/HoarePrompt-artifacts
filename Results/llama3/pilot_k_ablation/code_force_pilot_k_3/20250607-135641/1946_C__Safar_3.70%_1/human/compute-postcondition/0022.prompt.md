Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, c is 1, r is 0
Code of the loop:
for node in g[x]:
    if node not in visited:
        ans, rn = dfs(node, y)
        r += rn
        if ans >= y:
            r += 1
        else:
            c += ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x. If node is not in visited, then visited contains x and all nodes visited by dfs(node, y), g[x] must not be empty, node is the first node in g[x], and the current value of node is in the set of visited nodes. If ans is greater than or equal to y, then c is 1 and r is the original value of r plus the return value of rn from dfs(node, y) plus 1. If ans is less than y, then c is 1 plus ans and r is the original value of r plus the return value of rn from dfs(node, y). If node is in visited, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the second node in g[x], g[x] must have at least two nodes. If node is not in visited, then the function performs a depth-first search on node with y, and updates r and c accordingly based on the result of the search. If node is in visited, then no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third node in g[x], g[x] must have at least three nodes. If node is not in visited, then ans is the result of dfs(node, y), rn is the return value of dfs(node, y). If ans is greater than or equal to y, r is increased by 1 plus the return value of dfs(node, y). Otherwise, r is increased by the return value of dfs(node, y) and c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y). If node is in visited, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
