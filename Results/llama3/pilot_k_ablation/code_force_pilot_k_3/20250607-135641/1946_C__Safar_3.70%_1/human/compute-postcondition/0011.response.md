Output State: **x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the second node in g[x], g[x] must have at least two nodes, ans is the result of dfs(node, y), r is increased by the return value of dfs(node, y), rn is the return value of dfs(node, y)**
