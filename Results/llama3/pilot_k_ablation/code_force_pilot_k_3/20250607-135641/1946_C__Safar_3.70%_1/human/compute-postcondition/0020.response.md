Postcondition: ***x is a node in a tree, y is a non-negative integer, g is a dictionary representing the adjacency list of the tree, visited is a set of visited nodes containing x, node is the third node in g[x], g[x] must have at least three nodes, ans is the result of dfs(node, y), rn is the return value of dfs(node, y). If ans is greater than or equal to y, r is increased by 1 plus the return value of dfs(node, y). Otherwise, r is increased by the return value of dfs(node, y) and c is increased by the result of dfs(node, y).***
