Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: c and r. c is 1 plus the sum of ans for all nodes in g[x] where ans is less than y, and r is the original value of r plus the sum of rn for all nodes in g[x] plus the number of nodes in g[x] where ans is greater than or equal to y.**
