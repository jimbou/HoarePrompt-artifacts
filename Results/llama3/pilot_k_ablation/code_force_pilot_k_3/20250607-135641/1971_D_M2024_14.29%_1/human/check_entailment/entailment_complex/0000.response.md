Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

*   The program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
*   For each test case, it reads a binary string `a`.
*   It initializes a variable `cut` to 0, which will store the minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.
*   The program then iterates over the characters in the string `a`, checking for occurrences of the substring '10'. Each time it finds such an occurrence, it increments the `cut` variable.
*   After iterating over the entire string, it prints the value of `cut + 1`, which represents the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

*   A sorted binary string consists of all 0s followed by all 1s.
*   The minimum number of cuts needed to rearrange a binary string into a sorted binary string is equal to the number of times the string switches from 1 to 0, plus 1 (for the initial piece).
*   By counting the occurrences of the substring '10', the program effectively counts the number of times the string switches from 1 to 0.
*   Adding 1 to this count gives the minimum number of pieces needed to rearrange the string into a sorted binary string.

Correctness: **True**
