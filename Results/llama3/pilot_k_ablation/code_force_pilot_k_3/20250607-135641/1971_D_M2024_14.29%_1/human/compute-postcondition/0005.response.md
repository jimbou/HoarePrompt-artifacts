Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `cut` is 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cut` being 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `a[i]` is still '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is still '0'. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings `s` consisting of characters 0 and 1.
