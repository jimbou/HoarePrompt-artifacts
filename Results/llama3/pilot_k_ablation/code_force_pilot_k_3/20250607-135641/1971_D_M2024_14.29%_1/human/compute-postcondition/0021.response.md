Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `i` is 0. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is the number of occurrences of '10' in `a` plus 1. Otherwise, `cut` remains the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`.***
