The value of `cut` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cut` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `cut` is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `i` is 2, `cut` is increased by 1**
