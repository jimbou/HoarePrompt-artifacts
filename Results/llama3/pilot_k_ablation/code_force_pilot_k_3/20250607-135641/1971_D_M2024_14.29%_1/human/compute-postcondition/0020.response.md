Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `cut` is the number of occurrences of '10' in `a` plus 1, `i` is 0. The current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The number of strings in `stdin` is still `t-2`, and the properties of `a`, `i`, `a[i]`, and `a[i + 1]` are the same as before.
