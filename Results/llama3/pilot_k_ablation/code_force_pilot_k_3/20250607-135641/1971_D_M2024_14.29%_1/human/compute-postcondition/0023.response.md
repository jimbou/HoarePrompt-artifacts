The value of `cut` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1. The value of `t` is still at least 2. The string `a` is still of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1. The value of `i` is still 1.

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `cut` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `i` is 1**
