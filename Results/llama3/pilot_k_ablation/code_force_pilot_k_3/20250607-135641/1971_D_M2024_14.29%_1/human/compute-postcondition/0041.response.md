Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, `a` is a string of length at least 3 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `i` is `len(a)`, `cut` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `cut` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `t`, `stdin`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The length of string `a` is still at least 3, and it consists of characters 0 and 1. The value of `i` is still equal to the length of string `a`. The stdin still contains `t-2` strings.
