Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `i` is 1, `cut` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cut` is increased by 1, while the values of `t`, `stdin`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` strings `s` with a length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1. The string `a` still has a length of at least 2 and consists of characters 0 and 1. The variable `i` is still 1.
