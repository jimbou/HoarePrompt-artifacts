The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the standard input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 500) followed by `t` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, the value of `t` will be an integer between 1 and 500.

After executing the code, the standard input will still contain the `t` strings `s`, but the first integer `t` will be consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500, stdin contains `t` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1**
