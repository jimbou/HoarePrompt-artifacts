The value of `cut` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cut` is 0, so the new value of `cut` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, `a` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `cut` is 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0'.
