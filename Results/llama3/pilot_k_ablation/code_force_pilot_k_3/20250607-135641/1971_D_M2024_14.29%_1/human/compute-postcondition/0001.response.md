The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. However, we can make the state more specific by saying that `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains `t` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1**
