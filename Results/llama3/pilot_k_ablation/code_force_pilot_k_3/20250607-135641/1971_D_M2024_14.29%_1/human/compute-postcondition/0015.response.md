The code prints the value of `cut` (the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`) plus 1.
Output: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `cut` is the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, and the value of `cut` plus 1 is being printed**
