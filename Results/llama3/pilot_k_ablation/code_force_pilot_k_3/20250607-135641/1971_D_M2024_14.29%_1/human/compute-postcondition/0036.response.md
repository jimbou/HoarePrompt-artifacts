Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, `a` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `i` is `len(a) - 1`. If the current value of `a[i]` is '1' and the current value of `a[i + 1]` is '0', then `cut` is 1. Otherwise, the state of `cut` is not changed.***
