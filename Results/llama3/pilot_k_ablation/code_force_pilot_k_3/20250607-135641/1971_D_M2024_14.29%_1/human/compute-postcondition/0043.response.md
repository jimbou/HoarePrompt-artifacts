Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` strings, `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `i` is 0, `cut` is the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `i` will be 0, and the variable `cut` will be equal to the number of occurrences of the substring '10' in the string `a`. The other variables `t` and `stdin` remain unchanged.
