The code snippet reads a string `a` from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `a`. The variable `cut` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 strings s (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, a is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, cut is 0**
