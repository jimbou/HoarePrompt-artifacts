The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be at least 1.
State: **`t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` strings `s` (1 <= |s| <= 500) consisting of characters 0 and 1, `a` is a string of length between 1 and 500 consisting of characters 0 and 1, `cut` is the number of occurrences of '10' in `a`, and `i` is `len(a) - 1`**
