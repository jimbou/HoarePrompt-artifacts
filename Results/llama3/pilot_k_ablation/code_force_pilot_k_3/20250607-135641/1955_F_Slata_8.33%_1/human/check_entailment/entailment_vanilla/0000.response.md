Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice in a game where Eve removes numbers optimally. The game is won by Alice if the bitwise XOR of all numbers in the sequence is non-zero, and by Bob if it is zero.

The given program uses a simple formula to calculate the maximum number of times Bob can win. The formula is based on the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. For each test case, the program reads four integers representing the number of ones, twos, threes, and fours in the sequence.
2. The program calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win by adding the integer divisions of each count by 2. This is because each pair of identical numbers can be removed by Eve to make the XOR zero.
3. The program also checks if the sum of the remainders of the counts of ones, twos, and threes is equal to 3. If it is, it means that there is an odd number of ones, twos, and threes, which can be removed by Eve to make the XOR zero. In this case, the program adds 1 to the total count of Bob's wins.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account all possible scenarios where Eve can remove numbers to make the XOR zero. The use of integer division and remainder checks ensures that the program accurately calculates the maximum number of times Bob can win.

Correctness: **True**
