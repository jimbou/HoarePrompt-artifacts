Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input is (0, 0, 0, 0). In this case, the program should output 0, but it outputs 1. This is because the program incorrectly assumes that if the sum of the remainders of a, b, and c divided by 2 is 3, then Bob wins. However, this is not true when all the numbers are 0.

The correct solution should be:

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b, c, d) = map(int, input().split())
        print(a // 2 + b // 2 + c // 2 + d // 2 + int(a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 == 0 and a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 2 + d % 2 == 0))

This solution correctly handles the case when all the numbers are 0.
