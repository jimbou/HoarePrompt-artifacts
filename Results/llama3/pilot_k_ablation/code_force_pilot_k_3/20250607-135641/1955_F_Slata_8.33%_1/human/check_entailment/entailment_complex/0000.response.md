Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The problem requires finding the maximum number of times Bob can win against Alice if Eve removes the numbers optimally. This can be achieved by maximizing the number of times the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
2.  The program calculates the sum of the integer divisions of the four integers by 2, which represents the maximum number of times Bob can win when the XOR of the remaining numbers is zero.
3.  The program also checks if the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 2 and the fourth integer divided by 3 is equal to 3. If this condition is true, it means that Eve can remove one number to make the XOR of the remaining numbers zero, resulting in an additional win for Bob.
4.  The program repeats this process for each test case and prints the result.

The logic is correct, and the program should produce the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
