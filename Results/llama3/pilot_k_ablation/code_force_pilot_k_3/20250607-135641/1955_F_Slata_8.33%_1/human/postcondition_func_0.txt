The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four integers between 0 and 200. For each test case, it calculates and prints the sum of the integer divisions of the four integers by 2, plus 1 if the sum of the remainders of the first three integers divided by 2 and the fourth integer divided by 3 is equal to 3. The function repeats this process for a number of test cases specified by the first integer read from standard input.
