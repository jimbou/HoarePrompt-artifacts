The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`. 

Here, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200. The integer division of these numbers by 2 will result in the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are not taken into account. For example, if `a` is 3, then `a // 2` will be 1.

The expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` will be evaluated to a boolean value, either True or False. In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0 when converted to an integer.

So, the print statement will output the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus 1 if the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3` equals 3, and 0 otherwise.

Output: **the sum of the integer divisions of a, b, c, and d by 2, plus 1 if a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 equals 3, and 0 otherwise (where a, b, c, d are integers between 0 and 200)**
