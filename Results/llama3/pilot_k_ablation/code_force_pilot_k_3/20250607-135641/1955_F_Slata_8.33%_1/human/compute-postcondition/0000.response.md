To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `input()`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `int(input())` is greater than 0. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can adjust the state to reflect this.

State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), i is 0, int(input()) is greater than 0**
