Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` has been printed.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` have been updated to the four integers read from the input. The stdin now contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200). The sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` has been printed.
