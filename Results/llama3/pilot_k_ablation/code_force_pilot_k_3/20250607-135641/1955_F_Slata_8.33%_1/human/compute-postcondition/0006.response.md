The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`. 

The integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2 are calculated as `a // 2`, `b // 2`, `c // 2`, and `d // 2`. These values are integers between 0 and 100 because `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers between 0 and 200.

The expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` is a boolean expression that evaluates to either True or False. In Python, True is equivalent to 1 and False is equivalent to 0 when converted to integers. Therefore, the integer value of this expression is either 0 or 1.

The sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` is an integer between 0 and 404.

Output: **an integer between 0 and 404**
