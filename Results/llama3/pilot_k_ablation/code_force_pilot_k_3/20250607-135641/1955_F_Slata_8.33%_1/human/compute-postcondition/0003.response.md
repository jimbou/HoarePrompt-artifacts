The code prints the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`. Where `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200.
Output: ** `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), i is 0, int(input()) is greater than 0, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`**
