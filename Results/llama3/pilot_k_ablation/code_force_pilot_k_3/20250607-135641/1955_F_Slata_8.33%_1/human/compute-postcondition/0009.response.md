Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` has been printed, `i` is t-1, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200)**

Explanation: The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`. Since the input contains t lines, each containing four integers, and `i` is t, after reading one line, `i` becomes t-1 and stdin contains t-1 lines. The values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are updated to the new values read from the input. The sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` has already been printed before this code snippet, so it remains the same.
