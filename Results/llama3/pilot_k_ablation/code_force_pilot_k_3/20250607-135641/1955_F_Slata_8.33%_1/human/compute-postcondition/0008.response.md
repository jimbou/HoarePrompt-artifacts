The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `int(input())`. If `i` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is t-1, `int(input())` is t. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be t and `int(input())` must be greater than t.
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains t lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` has been printed, `i` is t, `int(input())` is greater than t**
