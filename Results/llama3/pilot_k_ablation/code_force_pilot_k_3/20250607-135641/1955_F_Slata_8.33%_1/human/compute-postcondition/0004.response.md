The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and `int(input())`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `int(input())`. If `i` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (2 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), i is 1, int(input()) is greater than 1, and this is printed: the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3**
