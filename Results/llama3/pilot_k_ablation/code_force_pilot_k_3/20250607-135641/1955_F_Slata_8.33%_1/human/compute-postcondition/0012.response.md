Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, the sum of the integer divisions of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3` has been printed `t` times, `i` is `t`, stdin is empty, and int(input()) is 0.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are still integers between 0 and 200, but the loop has printed the sum of the integer divisions of these variables by 2, plus the integer value of the expression `a % 2 + b % 2 + c % 3 == 3`, `t` times. The loop counter `i` has reached the value `t`, indicating that the loop has executed `t` times. The input buffer is empty, and attempting to read an integer from the input would result in an error (int(input()) is 0).
