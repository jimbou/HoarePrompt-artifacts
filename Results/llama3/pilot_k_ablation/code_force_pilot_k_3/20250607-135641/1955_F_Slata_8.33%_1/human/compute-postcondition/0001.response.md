Output State: **`a`, `b`, `c`, `d` are integers between 0 and 200, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), i is 0, int(input()) is greater than 0**

In this output state, the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are assigned the values of the four integers from the input, which are between 0 and 200. The stdin still contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t-1 lines, each containing four integers p_i (0 <= p_i <= 200), and the value of i is 0. Also, the value of int(input()) is still greater than 0.
