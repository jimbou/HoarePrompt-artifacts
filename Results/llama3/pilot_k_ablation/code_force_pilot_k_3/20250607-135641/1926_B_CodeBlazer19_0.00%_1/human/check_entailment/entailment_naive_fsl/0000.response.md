Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The issue lies in the way it checks for triangles and squares. 

For example, if the input is:

```
4
0000
0000
0100
1110
```

The program will output "TRIANGLE" because it finds a row with more than one '1' and assumes it's a square, but then it finds a row with only one '1' and assumes it's a triangle. However, the correct output should be "TRIANGLE" because the shape is indeed a triangle.

The program does not correctly check the pattern of the '1's in the grid to determine the shape. It only checks the count of '1's in each row, which is not enough to determine the shape.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should check the pattern of the '1's in the grid, not just the count. It should check if the '1's form a triangle or a square by checking the positions of the '1's in each row.
