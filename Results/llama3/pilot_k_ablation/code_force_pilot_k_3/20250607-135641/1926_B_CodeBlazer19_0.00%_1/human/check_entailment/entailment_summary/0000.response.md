Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and prints 'Triangle', or if any row contains more than one '1' and prints 'Square'. However, this logic is not sufficient to correctly identify the shape.

For example, a triangle can have more than one '1' in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row. Similarly, a square can have exactly one '1' in a row, as long as the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

The program does not take into account the structure of the shape, it only checks the number of '1's in each row. Therefore, it can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
