Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1' and prints 'Triangle' or 'Square' accordingly. However, this approach is not sufficient to determine the shape of the figure.

For example, consider the following input:

    3
    000
    011
    011

The program will print 'Square' because the second row contains more than one '1'. However, the correct output should be 'Triangle' because the figure is a triangle.

The program does not check the structure of the figure, it only checks the number of '1's in each row. Therefore, it is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
