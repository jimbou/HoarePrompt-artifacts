Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters '0' or '1', `j` is 2, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', stdin contains `t-5` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases, each with an integer `n` and `n` lines of `n` characters '0' or '1'.
