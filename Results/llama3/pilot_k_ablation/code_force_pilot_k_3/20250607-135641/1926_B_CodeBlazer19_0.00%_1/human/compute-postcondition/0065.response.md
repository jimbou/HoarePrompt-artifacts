To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `j` is initialized to `n-1`, we need to adjust `j` to be at least 0.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and at least 1, `j` is at least 0, `s` is the last string read from stdin, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty**
