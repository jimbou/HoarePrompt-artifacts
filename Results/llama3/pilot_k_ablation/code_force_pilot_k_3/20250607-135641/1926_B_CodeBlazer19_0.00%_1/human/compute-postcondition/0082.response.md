Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 4, `s` is a string that is the first input from stdin, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', stdin contains one input: a string.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle'. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` is still dependent on the content of `s`, but it is now either an empty string or 'Square' because `a` is 'Triangle'.
