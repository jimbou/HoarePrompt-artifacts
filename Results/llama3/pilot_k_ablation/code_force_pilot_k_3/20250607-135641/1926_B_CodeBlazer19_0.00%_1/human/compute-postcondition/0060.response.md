The code prints the value of `b`, which depends on whether the string `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1'. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is 'Square', otherwise, it is an empty string.

Output: **either 'Square' or an empty string, depending on whether s contains more than one '1' or no '1' respectively**
