Output: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n`, `s` is the last string read from `stdin`, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `a` is 'Triangle' because any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', and `b` is 'Square' if any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, and 'Triangle' is being printed**
