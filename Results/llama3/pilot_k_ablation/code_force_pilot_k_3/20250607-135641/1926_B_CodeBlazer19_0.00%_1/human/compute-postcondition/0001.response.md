To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), we can adjust the state to reflect that `t` must be greater than 0 and `i` is now 0 (since the loop starts from 0).

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters '0' or '1'**
