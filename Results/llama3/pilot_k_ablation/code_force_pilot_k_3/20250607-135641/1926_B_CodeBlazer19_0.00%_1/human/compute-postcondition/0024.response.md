Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `a` is 'Triangle' if any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square' if any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `j` is `n`, `s` is the last string read from `stdin`, `stdin` is empty.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is the number of lines in the current test case. The values of `a` and `b` are determined by the contents of the strings `s` read from `stdin` during the loop iterations. If any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is set to 'Triangle'. If any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'Square'. Otherwise, `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. The loop has consumed all the input from `stdin`, leaving it empty.
