Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last string read from stdin, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` which is not 0 is being printed. If `s` contains more than one '1', then the value of `b` which is 'Square' is being printed. If `s` contains no '1', then the value of `b` which is an empty string is being printed.***
