Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n`, `s` is the last string read from `stdin`, `stdin` is empty. If any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and 'Triangle' is printed. If any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square' and 'Square' is printed. If none of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and an empty string is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the final values of the variables are as follows:

*   `t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than or equal to 0, indicating that the loop has executed for all test cases.
*   `i` is `t`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
*   `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), indicating that the last test case has been processed.
*   `j` is `n`, indicating that the inner loop has completed processing the last test case.
*   `s` is the last string read from `stdin`, indicating that all input has been processed.
*   `stdin` is empty, indicating that all input has been consumed.

The output state also indicates that the final values of `a` and `b` depend on the input strings `s`. If any string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and 'Triangle' is printed. If any string `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square' and 'Square' is printed. If none of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and an empty string is printed.
