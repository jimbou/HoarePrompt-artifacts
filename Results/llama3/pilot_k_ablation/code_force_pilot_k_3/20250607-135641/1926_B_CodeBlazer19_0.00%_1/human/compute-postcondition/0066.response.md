Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and at least 1, `j` is at least 0, `s` is the last string read from stdin, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, stdin contains one input: a string**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1. The value of `i` remains 2. The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and at least 1. The value of `j` remains at least 0. The value of `a` remains 0. The value of `b` remains an empty string. The value of `s` is updated to the last string read from stdin. Stdin now contains one input: a string.
