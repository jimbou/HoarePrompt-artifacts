Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters '0' or '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'Triangle'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'Square'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n`, `s` is the last string read from `stdin`, `stdin` is empty. If any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and 'Triangle' is printed. If any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square' and 'Square' is printed. If none of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and an empty string is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last string read from stdin, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` which is not 0 is being printed. If `s` contains more than one '1', then the value of `b` which is 'Square' is being printed. If `s` contains no '1', then the value of `b` which is an empty string is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n`, `s` is a string that is the last input from stdin, stdin is empty. If `a` is 'Triangle', then 'Triangle' is being printed. If `a` is 0, then either an empty string or 'Square' is being printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
