Based on the initial state, the value of `a` is determined by the presence of the string '1' in the input string `s`. Since `s` contains exactly one '1', the value of `a` is 'Triangle'.

Therefore, when the `print(a)` statement is executed, it will print the value of `a`, which is 'Triangle'.

Output: **Triangle**
