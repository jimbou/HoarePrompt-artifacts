Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and at least 1, `j` is at least 0, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, stdin contains one input: a string, and the last string read from stdin, `s`, contains exactly one '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input: a string, and the last string read from stdin, `s`, still contains exactly one '1'.
