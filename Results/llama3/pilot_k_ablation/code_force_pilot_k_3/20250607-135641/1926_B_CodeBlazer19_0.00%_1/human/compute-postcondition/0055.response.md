Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n-1`, `s` is the last string read from stdin, stdin contains `n-1` inputs: strings. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

The loop has finished executing, and the variables have reached their final state. The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1. The value of `i` is still 1. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive). The value of `j` has reached `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The value of `s` is the last string read from stdin. The stdin contains `n-1` inputs, which are strings. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the last string read from stdin. If it contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If it contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If it contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.
