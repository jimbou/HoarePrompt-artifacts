Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and at least 1, `j` is at least 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', stdin contains one input: a string, and the string `s` contains more than one '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to 'Square'. The values of the other variables remain the same. The input in stdin is still a string, and the string `s` still contains more than one '1'.
