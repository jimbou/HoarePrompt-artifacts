Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and at least 1, `j` is at least 0, stdin contains one input: a string. If the last string read from stdin, `s`, contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than one '1', then `a` is 0. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'Square'.***
