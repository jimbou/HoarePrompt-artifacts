Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 0, `s` is the last string read from stdin and contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` has been changed to 'Triangle'. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The variable `t` is still an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is still 1, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is still 0, `s` is still the last string read from stdin and contains exactly one '1', `b` is still an empty string, and stdin is still empty.
