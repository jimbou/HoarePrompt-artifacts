Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `s` is a string of `n` characters '0' or '1', `j` is 2, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', stdin contains `t-5` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is still 0, `n` is still an integer between 3 and 10, `s` is still a string of `n` characters '0' or '1', `j` is still 2, `a` is still either 'Triangle' or 0, but `b` is now 'Square' instead of being either an empty string or 'Square'. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases, each containing an integer `n` followed by `n` lines of `n` characters '0' or '1'.
