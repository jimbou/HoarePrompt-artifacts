To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `n`, `j`, `s`, `stdin`, `a`, and `b`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n`, `s` is the last string read from `stdin`, `stdin` is empty. If any of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and 'Triangle' is printed. If any of the strings `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square' and 'Square' is printed. If none of the strings `s` contains exactly one '1' or more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and an empty string is printed.**
