Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 4, `s` is a string that is the first input from stdin, stdin contains one input: a string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.***
