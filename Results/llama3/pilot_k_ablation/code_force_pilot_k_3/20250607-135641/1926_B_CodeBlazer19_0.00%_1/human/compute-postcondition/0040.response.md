Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 0, `s` is the last string read from stdin and it contains more than one '1', `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been changed to 'Square'. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `s`, `a`, and stdin remain the same as in the initial state.
