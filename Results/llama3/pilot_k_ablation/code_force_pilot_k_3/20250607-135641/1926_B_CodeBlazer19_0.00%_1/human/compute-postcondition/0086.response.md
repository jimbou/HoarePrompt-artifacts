Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is `n`, `s` is a string that is the last input from stdin, `a` is either 0 or 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', stdin is empty.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t` and `i` as in the initial state. The value of `n` will remain the same as in the initial state, but `j` will be equal to `n` after the loop finishes. The value of `s` will be the last string read from stdin. The value of `a` will be either 0 or 'Triangle', depending on whether the last string read from stdin contains exactly one '1'. The value of `b` will be either an empty string or 'Square', depending on whether the last string read from stdin contains more than one '1'. Stdin will be empty after the loop finishes.
