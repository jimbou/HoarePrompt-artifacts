The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10), `n` becomes an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive). The second line assigns the value 0 to `a`. The third line assigns an empty string to `b`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains t-2 test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines, each containing n characters '0' or '1'**
