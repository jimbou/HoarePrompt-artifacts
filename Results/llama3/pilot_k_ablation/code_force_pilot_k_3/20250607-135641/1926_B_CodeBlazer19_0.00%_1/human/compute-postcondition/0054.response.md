Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 2, `j` is 2, `s` is the last string read from stdin, stdin contains one input: a string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.***
