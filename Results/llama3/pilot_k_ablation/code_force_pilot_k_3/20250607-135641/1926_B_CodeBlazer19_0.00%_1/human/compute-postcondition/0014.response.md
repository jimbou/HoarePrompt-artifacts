Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is 'Square' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 1, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and is assigned the value of the first test case, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `a` is now 'Triangle', regardless of the previous condition. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The input in the standard input remains the same, with `t-4` test cases.
