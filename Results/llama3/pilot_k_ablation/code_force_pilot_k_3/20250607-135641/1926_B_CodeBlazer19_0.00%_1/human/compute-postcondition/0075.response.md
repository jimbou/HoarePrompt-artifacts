Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 3, `s` is a string, if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string, if `s` contains either 0 or more than one '1', then `a` is 0, if `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'Square'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The variable `s` is assigned the value of the input string from stdin. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the content of `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than one '1', then `a` is 0. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is set to 'Square'.
