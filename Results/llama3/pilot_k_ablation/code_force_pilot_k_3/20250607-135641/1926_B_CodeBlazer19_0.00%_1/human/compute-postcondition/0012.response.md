The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `a` is 'Triangle' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square' if `s` contains more than one '1', otherwise `b` is an empty string, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'.**
