Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 0, `s` is the last string read from stdin, `a` is 0, stdin is empty. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty string.***
