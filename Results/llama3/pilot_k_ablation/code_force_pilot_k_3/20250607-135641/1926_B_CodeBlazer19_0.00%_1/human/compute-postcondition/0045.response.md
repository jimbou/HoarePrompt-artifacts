Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the last string read from stdin, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string if `s` contains no '1' or one '1', or 'Square' if `s` contains more than one '1'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is now 'Triangle', regardless of the previous conditions. The value of `b` depends on the content of `s`: if `s` contains no '1' or exactly one '1', `b` is an empty string; if `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'.
