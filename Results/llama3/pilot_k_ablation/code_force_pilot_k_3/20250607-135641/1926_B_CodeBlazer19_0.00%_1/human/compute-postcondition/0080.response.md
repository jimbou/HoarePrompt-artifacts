The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 4, `s` is a string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains either 0 or more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.**
