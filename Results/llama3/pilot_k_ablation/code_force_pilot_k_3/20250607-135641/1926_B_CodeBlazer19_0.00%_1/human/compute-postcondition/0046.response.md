Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the last string read from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `b` is updated to 'Square', regardless of the previous value of `s`. The value of `a` depends on the number of '1's in `s`: if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle'; if `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0; if `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0.
