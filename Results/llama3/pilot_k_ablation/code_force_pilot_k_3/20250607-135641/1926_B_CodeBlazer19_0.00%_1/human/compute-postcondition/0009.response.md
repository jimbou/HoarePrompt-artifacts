Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'. The string `s` contains more than one '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to 'Square'. All other variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` is still present, containing `t-3` test cases with the specified format. The string `s` still contains more than one '1'.
