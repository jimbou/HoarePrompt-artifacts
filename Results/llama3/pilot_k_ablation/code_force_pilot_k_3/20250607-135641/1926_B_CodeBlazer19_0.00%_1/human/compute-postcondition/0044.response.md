Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `j` is 1, `s` is the last string read from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string. stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to the last string read from stdin. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the number of '1's in the new string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string. The stdin is now empty.
