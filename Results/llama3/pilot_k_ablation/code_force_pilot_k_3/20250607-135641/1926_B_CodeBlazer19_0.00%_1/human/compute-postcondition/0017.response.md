Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive), `j` is 1, `s` is an integer between 2 and 10 (inclusive) and is assigned the value of the first test case, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, each containing an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10) followed by `n` lines, each containing `n` characters '0' or '1'. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.**
