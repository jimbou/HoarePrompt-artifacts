Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by choosing n integers from list b and arranging them in a certain order to make the array as different as possible from Petya's array.

The program first reads the input, sorts both lists a and b, and then uses a two-pointer technique to compare the elements from both lists. It calculates the absolute differences between the closest pairs of elements and adds them to the total difference D.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the differences between the pairs of elements are equal, and when the differences are not equal. It also correctly updates the pointers to move to the next elements in both lists.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n + m log m) due to the sorting of both lists, and the space complexity is O(n + m) for storing the input lists.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
