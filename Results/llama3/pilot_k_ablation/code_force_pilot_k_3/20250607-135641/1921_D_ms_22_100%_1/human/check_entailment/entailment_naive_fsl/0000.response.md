Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by Vasya's array from Petya's array.

The program first sorts both arrays in ascending order. Then, it uses two pointers, one at the beginning of each array and one at the end of each array. It calculates the absolute difference between the current elements of the two arrays at the four possible positions (beginning-beginning, beginning-end, end-beginning, end-end) and chooses the maximum difference. It then moves the corresponding pointers accordingly.

This approach ensures that the program considers all possible combinations of elements from the two arrays and chooses the combination that maximizes the total difference.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the arrays have the same length, when one array is a subset of the other, and when the arrays have different lengths.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n + m log m) due to the sorting of the arrays, where n and m are the lengths of the arrays. The space complexity is O(1) as the program only uses a constant amount of space to store the pointers and the maximum difference.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it meets the requirements of the problem description.
