This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m, representing the sizes of two lists a and b, respectively. The second line contains n integers for list a, and the third line contains m integers for list b. The function then sorts both lists and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the closest pairs of elements from the two lists, considering all possible pairs. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.
