    #State: *stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). The program prints the value of ans, which is an integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m, representing the sizes of two lists a and b, respectively. The second line contains n integers for list a, and the third line contains m integers for list b. The function then sorts both lists and calculates the sum of the absolute differences between the closest pairs of elements from the two lists, considering all possible pairs. Finally, it prints the calculated sum for each test case.
