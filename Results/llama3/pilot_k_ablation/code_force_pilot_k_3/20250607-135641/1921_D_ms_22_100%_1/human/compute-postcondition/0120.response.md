Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif2, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is either dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2 and at least 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, and ans is either the original value of ans plus dif2. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif2, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3, and b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, and b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.***
