The variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, and a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive. For the loop to be executed one more time, a1 must be less than a2. So, a1 must be less than n - 1, and a2 must be greater than 0.

State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer.**
