Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is n, a2 is -1, b1 is m, b2 is -1, ans is an integer, and the value of ans is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has finished executing all the test cases. The variable t, which represents the number of test cases minus one, is now 0. The variables n and m, which represent the number of elements in the lists a and b respectively, are still integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive. The lists a and b are still sorted lists of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The variables a1 and a2, which represent the indices of the elements in list a, are now n and -1 respectively, indicating that all elements in list a have been processed. Similarly, the variables b1 and b2, which represent the indices of the elements in list b, are now m and -1 respectively, indicating that all elements in list b have been processed. The variable ans, which represents the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and b, is now an integer. The value of ans is being printed, indicating that the loop has finished executing and the result is being output.
