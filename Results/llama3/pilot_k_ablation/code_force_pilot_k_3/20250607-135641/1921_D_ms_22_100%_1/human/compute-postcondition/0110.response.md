Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code block increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of `a` and `b`. This means that `ans` now holds a new value that is the sum of its original value and `dif4`. The second line decrements `a2` by 1, making it either `n - 2` or `n - 3` and at least 0. The third line decrements `b2` by 1, making it either `m - 2` or `m - 3`. No other variables are affected by the code.
