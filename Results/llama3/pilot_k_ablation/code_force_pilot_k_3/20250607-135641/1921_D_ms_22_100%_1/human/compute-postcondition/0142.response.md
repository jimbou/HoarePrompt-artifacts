The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is n, a2 is -1, b1 is m, b2 is -1, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between each pair of elements from a and b, and the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between each pair of elements from a and b is being printed**
