Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

The code block modifies the initial state in the following ways:

- The value of `t` is decremented by 1, making it greater than or equal to 0.
- The values of `n` and `m` are updated to the input values, which are integers between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive.
- The lists `a` and `b` are updated to the input values, which are sorted lists of `n` and `m` integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, respectively.
- The variables `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are initialized to 0, `n - 1`, 0, and `m - 1`, respectively.
- The variable `ans` is initialized to 0.
- The lists `a` and `b` are sorted in ascending order.
- The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

Note that the code block does not modify the values of `a1` and `a2` being equal, as they are initialized to 0 and `n - 1`, respectively, which are equal only when `n` is 1.
