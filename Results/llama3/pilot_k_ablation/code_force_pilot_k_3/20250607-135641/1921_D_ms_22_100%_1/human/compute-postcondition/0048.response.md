Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif2, a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of t, n, m, a, b, dif1, dif3, and dif4 remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of ans is increased by dif2, which is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2]. The value of a1 is incremented by 1, and the value of b2 is decremented by 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
