Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the (b1)th element of b, a1 is increased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the original value of dif1, a1 is increased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1.***
