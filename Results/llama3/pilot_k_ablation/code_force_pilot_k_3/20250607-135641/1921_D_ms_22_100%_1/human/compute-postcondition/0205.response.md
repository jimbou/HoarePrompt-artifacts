Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between -1 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 - 1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 - 1 in list a and the integer at index b2 + 1 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b2 + 1 in list b.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `dif2` to it. The value of `a1` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `b2` has been decremented by 1. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` have been updated accordingly based on the new values of `a1` and `b2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
