Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is one more than its original value, a2 is unchanged and still less than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1-1] and b[b1-1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1-1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1-1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], b1 is one more than its original value, b2 is unchanged, ans is the sum of its original value and dif1.**
