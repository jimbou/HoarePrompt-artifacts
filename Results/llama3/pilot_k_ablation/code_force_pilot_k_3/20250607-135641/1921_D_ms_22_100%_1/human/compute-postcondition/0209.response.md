Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is n, a2 is -1, b1 is m, b2 is -1, ans is an integer.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has terminated, and the values of a1, a2, b1, and b2 have been updated accordingly. The value of ans has been increased by the sum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and b that were compared during the loop's execution. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as t, n, m, a, and b, remains unchanged.
