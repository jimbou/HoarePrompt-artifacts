Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2**

The code calculates the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b` at specific indices (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) and assigns these differences to variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The stdin state is also unchanged as no input operations are performed in the given code snippet.
