Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this final state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and it remains greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n` and `m` have been assigned from the input and are within their specified ranges. The lists `a` and `b` have been populated with sorted integers from the input, and their lengths are `n` and `m`, respectively. The indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` have been initialized to their starting positions. The variable `ans` has been initialized to 0. The stdin now contains one less test case.
