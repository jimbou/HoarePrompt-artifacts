Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer. If dif4 > dif1, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and dif3 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 + 1 and the element of b at index b1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is increased by 1, and dif1 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 - 1 and the element of b at index b1 - 1.***
