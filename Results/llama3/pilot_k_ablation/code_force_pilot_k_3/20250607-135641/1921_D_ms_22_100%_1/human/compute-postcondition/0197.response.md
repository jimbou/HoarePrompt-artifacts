Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 2 inclusive, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 + 1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 + 1 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `a2`, and `b2`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the integer at index `a2` in list `a` and the integer at index `b2` in list `b`. The second line decrements `a2` by 1, and the third line decrements `b2` by 1. The values of `dif3` and `dif4` are affected by the change in `a2`, as they now refer to the absolute differences between the integer at index `a2 + 1` in list `a` and the integers at indices `b1` and `b2` in list `b`, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
