Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 2 inclusive, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b2 + 1 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 + 1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 + 1 in list a and the integer at index b2 + 1 in list b.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the integer at index `a2` in list `a` and the integer at index `b2` in list `b`. Then, it decrements `a2` and `b2` by 1. As a result, `a2` is now an integer between 0 and `n - 2` inclusive, and `b2` is now an integer between 0 and `m - 2` inclusive. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly, as they depend on the indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
