Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 1 and m inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer. If dif3 > dif1, then a1 is between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, a2 is between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, b1 is between 1 and m inclusive, b2 is between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, and ans is equal to its original value plus dif3. Otherwise, a1 is between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is between 1 and m inclusive, b2 is between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, and ans is equal to its original value plus dif1.**
