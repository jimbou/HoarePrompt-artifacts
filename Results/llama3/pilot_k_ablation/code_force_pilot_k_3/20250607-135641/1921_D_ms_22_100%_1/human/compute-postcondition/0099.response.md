Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The current value of dif4 is greater than the current value of dif2.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`. It then decrements `a2` and `b2` by 1, effectively moving the pointers for the last elements of `a` and `b` one step to the left. The values of `a1`, `b1`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif3` remain unchanged. The relationship between `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` also remains the same. The value of `t` and the contents of `stdin` are not affected by the code.
