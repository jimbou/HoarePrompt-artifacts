Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 1 and m inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 - 1 and the element of b at index b1 - 1, dif2 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 - 1 and the element of b at index b2, dif3 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b1 - 1, dif4 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the element of `a` at index `a1 - 1` and the element of `b` at index `b1 - 1`. The values of `a1` and `b1` have been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
