Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2. dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

The provided code snippet calculates the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b` at specific indices (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`). These differences are stored in variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are not modified by the code. The rest of the variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
