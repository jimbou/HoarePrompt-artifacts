Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated accordingly based on the changes made to a1, a2, b1, and b2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and the corresponding pointers are updated. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and the corresponding pointers are updated. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and the corresponding pointers are updated. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and the corresponding pointers are updated.**
