Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is n, a2 is -1, b1 is m, b2 is -1, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between each pair of elements from a and b.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the pointers a1 and b1 have reached the end of their respective lists a and b, and the pointers a2 and b2 have moved beyond the end of their respective lists. The variable ans now holds the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between each pair of elements from a and b. This is because the loop iteratively updates the pointers and the value of ans based on the comparisons between the absolute differences of the elements at the current positions of the pointers. The loop continues until a1 is greater than a2, at which point it terminates, leaving the pointers and the value of ans in their final state.
