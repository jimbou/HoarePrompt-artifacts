According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 0. However, being greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to t is greater than 0.

State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is equal to a2, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and b, and the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and b which is ans is being printed**
