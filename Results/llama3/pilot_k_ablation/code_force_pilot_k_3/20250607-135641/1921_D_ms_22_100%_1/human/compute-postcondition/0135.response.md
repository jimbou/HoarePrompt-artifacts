Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1 + 1)th element of a and the (b1)th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1 + 1)th element of a and the (b2 - 1)th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2)th element of a and the (b1)th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2)th element of a and the (b2 - 1)th element of b, ans is the original value of ans plus dif2, a1 is the original value of a1 plus 1, b2 is the original value of b2 minus 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `a1`, and `b2`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the second element of `b`. The second line increments `a1` by 1, effectively moving to the next element in the sorted list `a`. The third line decrements `b2` by 1, effectively moving to the previous element in the sorted list `b`. The values of `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly based on the new values of `a1` and `b2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
