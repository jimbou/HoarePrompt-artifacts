Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and the second last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code increments `a1` by 1 and `b2` by -1, effectively moving the pointers in list `a` one step to the right and in list `b` one step to the left. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`. The values of `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly, as the differences are now calculated with the new positions of `a1` and `b2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
