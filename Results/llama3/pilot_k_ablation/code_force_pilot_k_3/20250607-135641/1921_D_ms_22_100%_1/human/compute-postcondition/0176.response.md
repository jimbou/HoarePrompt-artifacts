Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer, dif1 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 and the element of b at index b1, dif2 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 and the element of b at index b2, dif3 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b1, dif4 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b2.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b` at specific indices and assigns these differences to variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. The indices `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are used to access elements in lists `a` and `b`. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are determined by the conditions in the initial state, which compare the absolute differences between elements of `a` and `b`. The code does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. The value of `ans` is not modified by the code snippet provided.
