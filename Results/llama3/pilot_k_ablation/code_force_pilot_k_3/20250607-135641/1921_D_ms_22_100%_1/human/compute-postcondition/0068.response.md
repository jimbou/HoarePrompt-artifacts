Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. In all cases, a1 is increased by 1, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly.**
