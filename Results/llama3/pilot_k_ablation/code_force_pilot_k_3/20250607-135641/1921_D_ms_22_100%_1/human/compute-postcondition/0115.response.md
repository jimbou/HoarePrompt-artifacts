Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is either 1 or 2 and at least 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either the original value of ans plus dif2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the first or second element of `a` and the last or second last element of `b`. It also increments `a1` by 1, making it either 1 or 2, and decrements `b2` by 1, making it either `m - 2` or `m - 3`. No other variables are affected.
