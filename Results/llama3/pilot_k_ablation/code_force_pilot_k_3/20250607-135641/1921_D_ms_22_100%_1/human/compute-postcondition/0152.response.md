Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1, a2, b1, b2, ans, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated according to the conditions. If dif3 is greater than dif1, then a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is increased by dif3, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif1, then a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is increased by dif1, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly.**
