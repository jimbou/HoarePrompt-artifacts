The only variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is either 0, 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 1, n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0. For the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than or equal to a2. So a1 must be less than or equal to n - 3 and a2 must be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is the original value of ans plus dif3. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2 and at least 1, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is either the original value of ans plus dif1 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then a1 is either 0, 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 1, n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 0, 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either the original value of ans plus dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is either dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2 and at least 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, and ans is either the original value of ans plus dif2. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif2, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3, and b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, and b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. a1 is less than or equal to n - 3 and a2 is greater than or equal to 1.**
