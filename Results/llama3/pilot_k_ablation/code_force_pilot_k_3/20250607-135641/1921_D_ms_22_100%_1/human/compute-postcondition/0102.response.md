Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. In both cases, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b.***
