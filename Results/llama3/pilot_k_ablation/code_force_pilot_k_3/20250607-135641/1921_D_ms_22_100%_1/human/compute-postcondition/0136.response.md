Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are the absolute differences between the elements of a and b as defined in the precondition. If dif4 is greater than dif2, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is increased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1.**
