Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer, dif1 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 and the element of b at index b1, dif2 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 and the element of b at index b2, dif3 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b1, dif4 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b2. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif2, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is increased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is equal to its original value plus dif4, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 2 inclusive, dif3 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 + 1 and the element of b at index b1, dif4 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 + 1 and the element of b at index b2. Otherwise, ans is equal to its original value plus dif2, a1 is an integer between 1 and n inclusive, b2 is an integer between -1 and m - 2 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 - 1 and the element of b at index b1, dif2 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 - 1 and the element of b at index b2 + 1.**
