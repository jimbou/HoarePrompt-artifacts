Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, if dif3 > dif2, then ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is increased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. The values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated accordingly based on the changes made to a1, a2, b1, and b2.**
