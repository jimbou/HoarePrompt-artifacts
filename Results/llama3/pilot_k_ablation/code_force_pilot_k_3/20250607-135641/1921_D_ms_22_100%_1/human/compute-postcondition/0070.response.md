Based on the initial state, the code will print the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of lists `a` and `b`. 

Since `a` and `b` are sorted lists of integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, the maximum absolute differences will be calculated by comparing the corresponding elements in the two lists. 

The value of `ans` is the sum of these maximum absolute differences.

Output: **The sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of lists a and b**
