Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif3 and dif1, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif1, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif3 and dif4, and ans is updated accordingly. In all cases, the absolute differences dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, if dif4 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1, and ans is incremented by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1]. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is greater than or equal to its original value plus dif3, a1 is less than a2-1, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. If dif3 is less than or equal to dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. In all cases, a1 is increased by 1, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
