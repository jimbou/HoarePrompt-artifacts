Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif3 and dif1, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif1, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif3 and dif4, and ans is updated accordingly. In all cases, the absolute differences dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.***
