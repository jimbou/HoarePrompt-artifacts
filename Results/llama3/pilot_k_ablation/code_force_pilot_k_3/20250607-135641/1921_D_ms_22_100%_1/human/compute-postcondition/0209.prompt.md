Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is either less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. If the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is not greater than the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the second last element of b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. If the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. If the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is not greater than the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, a2 is n - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
