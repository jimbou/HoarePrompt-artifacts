Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2 and at least 1, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either the original value of ans plus dif1 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `a1`, and `b1`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of `a` and `b`. The second line increments `a1` by 1, making it either 1 or 2. The third line increments `b1` by 1, making it either 1 or 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one.
