Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif2***
