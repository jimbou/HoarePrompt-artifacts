Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, if dif3 is greater than dif1, then ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1, and ans is incremented by dif1. In both cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and a1 must be less than a2.**
