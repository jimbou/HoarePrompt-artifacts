Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2 and a2 must be greater than or equal to 0, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either dif2, dif3 or dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains no input. The absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif2, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is dif3. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is dif2. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, a2 is n - 2, ans is dif4. Otherwise, a1 is 1, ans is dif2.***
