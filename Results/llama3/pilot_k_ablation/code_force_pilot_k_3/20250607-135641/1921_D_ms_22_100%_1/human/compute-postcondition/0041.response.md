Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1, ans is incremented by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still greater than or equal to 0. The values of `n` and `m` also remain unchanged, within their respective ranges. The lists `a` and `b` retain their sorted order and integer ranges. The differences `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are still defined based on the original indices `a1` and `a2` for list `a`, and `b1` and `b2` for list `b`. However, `a1` and `b1` are each incremented by 1. The variable `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between the elements at the original `a1` index in list `a` and the original `b1` index in list `b`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
