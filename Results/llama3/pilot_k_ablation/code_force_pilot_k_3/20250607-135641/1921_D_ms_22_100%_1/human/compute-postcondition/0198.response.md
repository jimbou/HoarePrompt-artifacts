Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 1 and m inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 - 1 in list a and the integer at index b1 - 1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 - 1 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b1 - 1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the integer at index `a1 - 1` in list `a` and the integer at index `b1 - 1` in list `b`. Then, it increments `a1` and `b1` by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The value of `t` also remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
