Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the (b1)th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the (b2)th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2)th element of a and the (b1)th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2)th element of a and the (b2)th element of b.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between specific elements of the sorted lists `a` and `b` and assigns these differences to the variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. The values of `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` are used to index into the lists `a` and `b` to determine which elements to use for the calculations. The code does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`, so these variables remain unchanged. The final state includes the updated values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, as well as the unchanged values of the other variables.
