Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1 and a2 must be greater than or equal to 0, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains no input. The current value of dif1 is greater than the current value of dif2. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b.**
