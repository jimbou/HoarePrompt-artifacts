The only variable in the loop head is a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 must be less than a2. So for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than a2.
State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, if dif4 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1, and ans is incremented by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1]. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is greater than or equal to its original value plus dif3, a1 is less than a2-1, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. If dif3 is less than or equal to dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1. a1 must be less than a2**
