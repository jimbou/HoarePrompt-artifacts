Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2.**

The code executes three lines that modify the state of the program. The first line increments the value of `ans` by `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. The second line decrements the value of `a2` by 1, and the third line decrements the value of `b2` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `a1` remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` is also unchanged, as it still contains multiple test cases minus one.
