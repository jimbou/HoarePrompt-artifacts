The variable in the loop head is a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is less than or equal to a2. So for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than a2.
State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif3 and dif1, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif4 and dif1, and ans is updated accordingly. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then a1 and a2 are updated based on the comparison of dif3 and dif4, and ans is updated accordingly. In all cases, the absolute differences dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2**
