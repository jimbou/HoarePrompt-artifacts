Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif3 is greater than dif2, then ans is greater than or equal to its original value plus dif3, a1 is less than a2-1, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. Otherwise, dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2] plus ans, a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1. In both cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
