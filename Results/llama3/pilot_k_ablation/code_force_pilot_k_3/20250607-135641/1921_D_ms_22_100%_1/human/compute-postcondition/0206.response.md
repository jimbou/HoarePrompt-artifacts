Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between -1 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus either dif4 or dif2, depending on whether dif4 is greater than dif2 or not. dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are the absolute differences between the integers at specific indices in lists a and b, with their values updated based on the comparison between dif4 and dif2.**
