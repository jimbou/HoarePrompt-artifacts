Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code block increments the value of `ans` by `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the last elements of lists `a` and `b`. It then decrements the indices `a2` and `b2` by 1, effectively moving the pointers to the second last elements in both lists. The rest of the variables and conditions remain unchanged.
