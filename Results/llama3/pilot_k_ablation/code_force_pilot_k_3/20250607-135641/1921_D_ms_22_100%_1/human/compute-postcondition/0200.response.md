Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif1, a1 and a2 are between 0 and n - 2 inclusive, b1 is between 1 and m inclusive, b2 is between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, and ans is equal to its original value plus dif3. Otherwise, a1 and a2 are between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is between 1 and m inclusive, b2 is between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, and ans is equal to its original value plus dif1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a1 and a2 are decreased by 1, b1 and b2 are decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 and a2 are increased by 1, b1 and b2 are increased by 1.***
