Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, a2 is unchanged and still less than a1, b1 is one more than its original value, b2 is unchanged, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif1. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value and is less than a2, b1 is one more than its original value, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif1.***
