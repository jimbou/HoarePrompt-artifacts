Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. The values of `a2` and `b2` have been decreased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` is also updated to reflect that one test case has been processed.
