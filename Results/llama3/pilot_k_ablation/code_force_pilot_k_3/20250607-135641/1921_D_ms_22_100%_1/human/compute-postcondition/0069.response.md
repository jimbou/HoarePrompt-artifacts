Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is equal to a2, ans is the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and b.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has terminated, and the variable 'ans' now holds the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of lists 'a' and 'b'. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
