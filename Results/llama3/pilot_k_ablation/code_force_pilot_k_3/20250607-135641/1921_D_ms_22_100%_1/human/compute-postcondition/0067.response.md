Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif2, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is increased by 1, ans is increased by dif2, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is increased by 1, a2 is less than a1, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1], and b2 is decreased by 1.**
