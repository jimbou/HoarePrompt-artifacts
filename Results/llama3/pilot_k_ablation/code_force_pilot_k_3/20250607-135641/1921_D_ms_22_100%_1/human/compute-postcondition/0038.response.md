Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1, ans is incremented by dif1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif2`, `dif3`, `dif4`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, which is `dif1`. The values of `a1` and `b1` are both incremented by 1.
