Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code block increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the last elements of `a` and `b`. It then decrements `a2` and `b2` by 1, effectively moving the pointers for the last elements of `a` and `b` one step backward. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly, as the last elements of `a` and `b` have changed. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
