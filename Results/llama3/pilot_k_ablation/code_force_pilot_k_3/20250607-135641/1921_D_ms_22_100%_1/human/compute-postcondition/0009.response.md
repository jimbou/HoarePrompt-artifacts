Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to its original value plus dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code block increments `ans` by the value of `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`. It then decrements `a2` by 1, effectively moving the second last element of `a` to the last position. Finally, it increments `b1` by 1, effectively moving the second element of `b` to the first position. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly based on the new positions of the elements in `a` and `b`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
