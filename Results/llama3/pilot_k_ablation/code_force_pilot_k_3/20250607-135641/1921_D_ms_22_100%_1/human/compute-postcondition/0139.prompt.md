Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of a and b. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of dif1 is either greater than or less than or equal to the current value of dif2. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, ans is dif3. Otherwise, a1 is 1, b1 is 1, ans is dif1. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif2, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. In both cases, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is the original value of ans plus dif3. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2 and at least 1, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is either the original value of ans plus dif1 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then a1 is either 0, 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 1, n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 0, 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1, m - 2 or m - 3, ans is either the original value of ans plus dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is either dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2 and at least 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3, and ans is either the original value of ans plus dif2. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif2, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3, and b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, and b2 is either m - 2 or m - 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. The values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are updated accordingly based on the changes made to a1, a2, b1, and b2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and the corresponding pointers are updated. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and the corresponding pointers are updated. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and the corresponding pointers are updated. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and the corresponding pointers are updated.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
