Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1 and a2 must be greater than or equal to 0, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is dif2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains no input. The absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b.**

Explanation: The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, making `ans` equal to `dif2`. The second line increments `a1` by 1, making `a1` equal to 1. The third line decrements `b2` by 1, making `b2` equal to `m - 2`. No other variables are affected.
