Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif2, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. In both cases, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b.***
