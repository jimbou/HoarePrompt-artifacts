Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive and is one more than its original value, a2 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive and is one more than its original value, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 and the element of b at index b1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 and the element of b at index b1, dif2 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a1 and the element of b at index b2, dif3 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b1, dif4 is the absolute difference between the element of a at index a2 and the element of b at index b2.**

The code increments `ans` by the absolute difference between the element of `a` at index `a1` and the element of `b` at index `b1`, which is `dif1`. Then, it increments `a1` and `b1` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.
