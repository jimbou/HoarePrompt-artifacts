Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to its original value plus dif3, and the absolute differences dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, and the absolute differences dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is dif4, and the absolute differences dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, and the absolute differences dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. In all cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.***
