Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, otherwise a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
