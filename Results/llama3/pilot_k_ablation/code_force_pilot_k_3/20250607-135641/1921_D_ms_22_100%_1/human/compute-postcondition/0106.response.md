Output State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2 and at least 1, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet provided updates the values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 based on the current values of a1, a2, b1, and b2. The new values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are calculated as the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of lists a and b. The values of a1, a2, b1, and b2 are not modified by the code. The value of ans is also not modified by the code. The value of t is not affected by the code. The values of n and m are not modified by the code. The lists a and b are not modified by the code. The value of stdin is not affected by the code.
