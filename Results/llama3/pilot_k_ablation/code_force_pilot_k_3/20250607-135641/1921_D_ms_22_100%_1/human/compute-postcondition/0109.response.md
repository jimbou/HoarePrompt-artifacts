Postcondition: ***t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. If dif3 is greater than dif1, then a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 3 and at least 0, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is the original value of ans plus dif3. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2 and at least 1, b1 is either 1 or 2, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, and ans is either the original value of ans plus dif1 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b.***
