The only variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition a1 <= a2. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is either 0 or 1, and a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the values of a1 and a2 such that a1 is still less than or equal to a2.

Since a1 is either 0 or 1, and a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2, we can adjust a2 to be at least 1, so that a1 (which is either 0 or 1) is still less than or equal to a2.

State: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive. a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2 and at least 1, b1 is either 0 or 1, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either dif1, dif3 or the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b or the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first or second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last or second last elements of a and b. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of dif1 is either greater than or less than or equal to the current value of dif2. If dif1 is greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, ans is dif3. Otherwise, a1 is 1, b1 is 1, ans is dif1. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif2, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. In both cases, the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b.**
