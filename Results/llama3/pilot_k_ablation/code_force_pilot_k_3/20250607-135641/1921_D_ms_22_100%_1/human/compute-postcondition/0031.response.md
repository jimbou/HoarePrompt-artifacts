Explanation:
The code increments `a1` by 1 and decrements `b2` by 1, effectively moving the pointers in the lists `a` and `b`. The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly, as the pointers in the lists have changed. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
