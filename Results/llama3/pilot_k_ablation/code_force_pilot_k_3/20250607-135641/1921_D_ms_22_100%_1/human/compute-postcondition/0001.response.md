Output State: **The program is running as the main module, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). t is an integer representing the number of test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the program is still running as the main module. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and processed. The first line of the test case contains two integers n and m, which are within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^5. The second line contains n integers a_i, which are within the range of 1 to 10^9. The third line contains m integers b_i, which are within the range of 1 to 10^9. The variable t is assigned the value of the number of test cases minus one, which is an integer.
