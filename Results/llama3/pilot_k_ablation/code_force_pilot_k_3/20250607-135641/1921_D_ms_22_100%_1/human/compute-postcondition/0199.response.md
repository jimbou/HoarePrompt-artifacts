Postcondition: **t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, m is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 inclusive, a is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, b is a sorted list of m integers between 1 and 10^9 inclusive, a1 is an integer between 0 and n - 1 inclusive, a2 is an integer between 1 and n - 1 inclusive, b1 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, b2 is an integer between 0 and m - 1 inclusive, ans is an integer. If dif4 is greater than dif1, then ans is increased by dif4, a1 is decreased by 1, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is increased by 1, a2 is increased by 1, b1 is increased by 1, and b2 is increased by 1.**
