#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the n integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is 0, _ is t, n is greater than or equal to 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus the sum of the minimum of the product of a and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements of arr and the value of b, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus t, i is equal to n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost at any point during the loop; otherwise, possible remains True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether possible is True or False.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines of input: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n positive integers in ascending order. The function calculates the energy cost of keeping a device on or turning it off and on again between each pair of consecutive integers. It then checks if the available energy (f) is sufficient to cover the total energy cost. If the energy is sufficient, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
