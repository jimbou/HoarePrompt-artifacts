This function processes multiple test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines of input: the first line contains four integers (n, f, a, and b), and the second line contains n positive integers in ascending order. The function calculates the energy cost of keeping a device on or turning it off and on again between each pair of consecutive integers. It then checks if the available energy (f) is sufficient to cover the total energy cost. If the energy is sufficient, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
