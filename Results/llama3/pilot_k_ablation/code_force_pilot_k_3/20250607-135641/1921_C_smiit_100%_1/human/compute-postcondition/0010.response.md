Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 1, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is 2, time_diff is the difference between the third and second elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times the difference between the third and second elements of arr, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of a times the difference between the third and second elements of arr and b, if the current value of f is less than or equal to the minimum of a times the difference between the third and second elements of arr and b, then possible is False.**

The code snippet updates the values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`. The new value of `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`. The new value of `energy_keep_on` is `a` times the new value of `time_diff`. The value of `energy_turn_off_on` remains the same as `b`. The new value of `energy_cost` is the minimum of the new values of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. The value of `f` is decreased by the new value of `energy_cost`, and the value of `possible` is updated based on the new value of `f`. All other variables remain unchanged.
