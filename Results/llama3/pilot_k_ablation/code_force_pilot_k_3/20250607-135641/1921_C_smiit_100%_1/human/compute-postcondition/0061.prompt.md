Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, _ is 2, n is the value of the first integer from the input, f is the value of the second integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is equal to n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and possible is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, _ is 2, n is greater than 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and if the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input is less than or equal to the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus twice the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of the fourth integer from the input, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `energy_cost` is the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` and the value of the fourth integer from the input. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus three times the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of the fourth integer from the input, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `energy_cost` is the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` and the value of the fourth integer from the input. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the value of `possible` is not changed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
