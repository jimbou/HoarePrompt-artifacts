Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, n is greater than or equal to 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus the sum of the minimum of the product of a and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements of arr and the value of b, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus t, i is equal to n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost at any point during the loop; otherwise, possible remains True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether possible is True or False.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, with the loop counter `_` equal to the initial value of `t`. The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `stdin`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` have been updated accordingly based on the loop's execution. The value of `possible` is determined based on whether `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost` at any point during the loop, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `possible` is True or False.
