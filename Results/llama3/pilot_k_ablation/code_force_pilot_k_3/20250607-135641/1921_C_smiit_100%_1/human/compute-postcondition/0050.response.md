Output State: **t is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, _ is 2, n is greater than 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and if the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input is less than or equal to the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains True.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on` from it. The value of `possible` remains the same, depending on whether the updated value of `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.
