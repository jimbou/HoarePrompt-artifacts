Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of a * time_diff and b for each iteration of the loop, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of a * time_diff and b. If the current value of f is less than or equal to the minimum of a * time_diff and b at any point during the loop, then possible is False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `t` remains a positive integer, `_` remains 0, `n` remains an integer, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b` for each iteration of the loop, `a` and `b` remain integers, `arr` remains a list of integers, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases with each test case containing one line of input. The loop counter `i` reaches `n`, and the variables `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are updated based on the last iteration of the loop. If at any point during the loop the current value of `f` becomes less than or equal to the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, then `possible` becomes False.
