To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and `t`. Since `t` is already a positive integer, we can confirm that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `_` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.


State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of the first test case has been read and its integer value is assigned to `t`.**
