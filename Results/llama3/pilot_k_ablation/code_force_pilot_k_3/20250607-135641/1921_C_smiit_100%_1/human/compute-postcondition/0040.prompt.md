Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer and is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is the value of the first integer from the input, f is the value of the second integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is the value of n, time_diff is not defined, energy_keep_on is not defined, energy_turn_off_on is not defined, energy_cost is not defined, possible is True.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of `b`, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is the difference between the second and first elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`; otherwise, `possible` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of `b` minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` and the value of `b`, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`; otherwise, `possible` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of `b` minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` and the value of `b` minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the fourth and third elements of `arr` and the value of `b`, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is the difference between the fourth and third elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`; otherwise, `possible` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
