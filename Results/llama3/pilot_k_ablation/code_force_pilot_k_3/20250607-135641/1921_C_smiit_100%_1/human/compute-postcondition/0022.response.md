The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer and is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of a * time_diff and b for each iteration of the loop, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of a * time_diff and b. If the current value of f is less than or equal to the minimum of a * time_diff and b at any point during the loop, then possible is False, and 'YES' is printed if possible is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed**
