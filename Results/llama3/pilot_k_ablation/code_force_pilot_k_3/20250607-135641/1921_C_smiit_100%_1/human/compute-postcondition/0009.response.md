The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 1, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is 2, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, if the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False.**
