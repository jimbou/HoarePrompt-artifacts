Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`. If the current value of `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been decreased by the minimum of `a` times the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still contains multiple test cases in the standard input, and the current test case is still being processed. The value of `possible` is still dependent on the current value of `f` and the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`.
