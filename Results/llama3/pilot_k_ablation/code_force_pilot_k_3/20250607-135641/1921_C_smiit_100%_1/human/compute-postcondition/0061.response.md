Output State: **t is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, _ is 2, n is greater than 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus n times the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is equal to n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of the fourth integer from the input, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and if the value of the second integer from the input minus n times the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input is less than or equal to the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains True.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed n times, and the value of f has been reduced by n times the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input. The value of possible is determined based on whether f is less than or equal to the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on after the loop has executed n times.
