Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, possible is True, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input.**

The code reads the first line of the first test case, which has already been read and its integer value is assigned to `t`. The second line of the first test case is read and its integer values are assigned to `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b`. The third line of the first test case is read and its integer values are assigned to `arr`. The variable `possible` is assigned the value `True`. The remaining test cases in stdin each contain one line of input.
