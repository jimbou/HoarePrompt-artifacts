Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, if the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of f has been decreased by the minimum cost of energy, which is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each with one line of input. The values of t, _, n, a, b, arr, i, time_diff, energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on, and energy_cost are the same as before. The value of possible is still False if the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost.
