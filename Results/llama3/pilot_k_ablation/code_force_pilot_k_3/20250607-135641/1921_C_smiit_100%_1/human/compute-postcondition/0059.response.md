Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, _ is 2, n is greater than 1, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus twice the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is 3, time_diff is the difference between the third and second elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and the difference between the third and second elements of arr, energy_turn_off_on is the value of the fourth integer from the input, energy_cost is the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the third and second elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input. If f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False. Otherwise, the value of possible is not changed.***
