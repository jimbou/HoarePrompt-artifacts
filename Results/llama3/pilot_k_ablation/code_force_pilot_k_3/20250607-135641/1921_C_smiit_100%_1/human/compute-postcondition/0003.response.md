To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` starts from 1, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 1. The state of `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `possible` is True, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, `i` is 1**
