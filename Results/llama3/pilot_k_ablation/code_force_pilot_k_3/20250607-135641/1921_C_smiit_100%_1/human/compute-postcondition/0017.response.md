Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 3, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is 3, time_diff is the difference between the third and second elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of a * time_diff and b. If the current value of f is less than or equal to the minimum of a * time_diff and b, then possible is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
