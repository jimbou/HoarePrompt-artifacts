The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of the first test case is read and assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of the first test case has been read and its integer value is assigned to `t`.**

In natural language, this means that the code has read the first line of the first test case from the standard input, which contains a positive integer, and assigned this integer value to the variable `t`. The remaining test cases and their input lines are still in the standard input, waiting to be read.
