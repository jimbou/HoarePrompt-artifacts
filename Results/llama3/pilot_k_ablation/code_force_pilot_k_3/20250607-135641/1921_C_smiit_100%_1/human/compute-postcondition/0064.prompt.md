Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines of input, the first line of the first test case has been read and its integer value is assigned to `t`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
        energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
        energy_turn_off_on = b
        energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
        if f <= energy_cost:
            possible = False
            break
        f -= energy_cost
    print('YES' if possible else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of a * time_diff and b for each iteration of the loop, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of a * time_diff and b. If the current value of f is less than or equal to the minimum of a * time_diff and b at any point during the loop, then possible is False, and 'YES' is printed if possible is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus the sum of the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements of `arr` and the value of `b`, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is equal to `n`, `time_diff` is the difference between the last and second last elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost` at any point during the loop; otherwise, `possible` remains True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `possible` is True or False

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, _ is 2, n is greater than 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus n times the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is equal to n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of the fourth integer from the input, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and if the value of the second integer from the input minus n times the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of the fourth integer from the input is less than or equal to the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains True, and 'YES' is printed if possible is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
