Postcondition: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on. If the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False.**
