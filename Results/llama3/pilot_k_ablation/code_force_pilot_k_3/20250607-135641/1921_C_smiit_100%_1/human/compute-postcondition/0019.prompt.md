Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is an integer, f is an integer, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, possible is True, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 0, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, if the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`. If the current value of `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
