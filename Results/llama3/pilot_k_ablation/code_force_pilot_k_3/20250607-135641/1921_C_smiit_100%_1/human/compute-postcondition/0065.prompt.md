You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines of input. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and the n integers in the second line are positive integers in ascending order.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is 0, _ is t, n is greater than or equal to 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus the sum of the minimum of the product of a and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements of arr and the value of b, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus t, i is equal to n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost at any point during the loop; otherwise, possible remains True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether possible is True or False.

Return Postconditions: t is 0, _ is t, n is greater than or equal to 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus the sum of the minimum of the product of a and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements of arr and the value of b, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus t, i is equal to n, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost at any point during the loop; otherwise, possible remains True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether possible is True or False.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
