Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is greater than 1, f is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is an integer, b is an integer, arr is a list of integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, i is 2, time_diff is the difference between the third and second elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times the difference between the third and second elements of arr, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of a times the difference between the third and second elements of arr and b. If the current value of f is less than or equal to the minimum of a times the difference between the third and second elements of arr and b, then possible is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
