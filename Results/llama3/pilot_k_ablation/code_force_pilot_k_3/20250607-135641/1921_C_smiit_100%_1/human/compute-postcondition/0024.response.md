To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to 1, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is not defined, `energy_keep_on` is not defined, `energy_turn_off_on` is not defined, `energy_cost` is not defined, `possible` is True**
