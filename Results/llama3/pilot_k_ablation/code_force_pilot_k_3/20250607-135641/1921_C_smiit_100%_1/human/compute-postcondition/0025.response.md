Output State: **t is a positive integer and is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 0, f is the value of the second integer from the input, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the second and first elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is True**

In this final state, all variables from the initial state are preserved, and new variables are introduced. The value of `time_diff` is calculated as the difference between the second and first elements of `arr`. The values of `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `time_diff`. The value of `possible` remains unchanged.
