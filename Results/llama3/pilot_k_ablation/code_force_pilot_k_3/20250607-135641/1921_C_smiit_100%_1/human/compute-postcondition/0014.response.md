The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `f` is an integer and is decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`. If the current value of `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
