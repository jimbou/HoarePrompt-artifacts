Output State: **t is a positive integer and is greater than 1, _ is 1, n is greater than 2, f is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the second and first elements of arr and the value of b minus the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the third and second elements of arr and the value of b, a is the value of the third integer from the input, b is the value of the fourth integer from the input, arr is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 3, time_diff is the difference between the fourth and third elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is the value of b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost; otherwise, possible remains True.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3. The value of `time_diff` is updated to be the difference between the fourth and third elements of `arr`. The value of `energy_keep_on` is updated to be the product of `a` and the new `time_diff`. The value of `energy_turn_off_on` is still the value of `b`. The value of `energy_cost` is updated to be the minimum of the new `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. The value of `possible` is updated based on the comparison between `f` and the new `energy_cost`.
