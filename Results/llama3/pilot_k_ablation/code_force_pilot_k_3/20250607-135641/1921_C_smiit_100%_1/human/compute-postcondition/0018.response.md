Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `f` is an integer decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is the difference between the third and second elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains one line of input.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, which is the value of `energy_cost`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `possible` is not affected by this code snippet, so its value remains the same as before.
