The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer and is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of `b`, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the second and first elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`; otherwise, `possible` remains True.**
