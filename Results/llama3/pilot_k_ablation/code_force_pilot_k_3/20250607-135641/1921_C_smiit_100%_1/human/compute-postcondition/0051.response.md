To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer and is equal to the previous value minus 1, `_` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `f` is the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of the fourth integer from the input, `a` is the value of the third integer from the input, `b` is the value of the fourth integer from the input, `arr` is a list of integers starting with 0 and followed by the remaining integers from the input, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the second and first elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is the value of `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and if the value of the second integer from the input minus the minimum of the product of `a` and the difference between the second and first elements of `arr` and the value of the fourth integer from the input is less than or equal to the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.**
