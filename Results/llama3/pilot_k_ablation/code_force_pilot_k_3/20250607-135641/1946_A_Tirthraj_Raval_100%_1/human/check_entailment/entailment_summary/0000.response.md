Reasoning: 
The program is correct. It correctly sorts the input array, finds the median, and counts the occurrences of the median. The median is found by using the formula (n + 1) // 2 - 1, which correctly calculates the index of the median in the sorted array. The count of the median is then calculated by using the count method on the sorted array, starting from the index of the median. This correctly counts the number of occurrences of the median.

The program also handles the case where the median is not unique, by counting all occurrences of the median. This is correct because the problem statement requires the minimum number of operations to increase the median, and increasing all occurrences of the median is the minimum number of operations required.

Correctness: **True**
