Based on the initial state, the code `print(res)` will print the value of the variable `res`, which is an integer.

Since the exact value of `res` is not provided in the initial state, we can't determine the exact numerical value that will be printed. However, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **the value of res (which is an integer)**
