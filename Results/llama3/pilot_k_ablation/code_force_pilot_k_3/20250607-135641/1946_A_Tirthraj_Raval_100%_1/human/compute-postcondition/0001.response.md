To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, we can infer that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Also, since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not important, but we can assume it will take on the value of the current iteration, starting from 0.

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
