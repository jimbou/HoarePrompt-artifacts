Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one test case. t is an integer equal to the number of test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input().strip())
    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))
    a.sort()
    p = (n + 1) // 2 - 1
    res = a[p:].count(a[p])
    print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, p is an integer, res is an integer, and the value of res is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two test cases, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, p is an integer, res is an integer equal to the count of the (n+1)//2 th element in the sorted list a, and the count of the (n+1)//2 th element in the sorted list a which is equal to res is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 2, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three test cases, n is an integer equal to the last input integer, a is a sorted list of integers equal to the last input list of integers, p is an integer equal to (n+1)//2 - 1, res is an integer equal to the count of the (n+1)//2 th element in the sorted list a, and the count of the (n+1)//2 th element in the sorted list a is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
