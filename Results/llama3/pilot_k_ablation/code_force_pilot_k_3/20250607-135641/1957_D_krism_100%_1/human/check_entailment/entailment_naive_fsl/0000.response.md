Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of tuples (x, y, z) such that 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ n, and f(x, y) ⊕ f(y, z) > f(x, z), where f(l, r) = a_l ⊕ a_{l + 1} ⊕ … ⊕ a_{r}.

The program uses a prefix array to store the cumulative XOR of the elements in the array, and two 2D arrays, pre and suf, to store the count of 0s and 1s in the binary representation of the prefix and suffix arrays, respectively.

The program then iterates over the array, updating the pre and suf arrays and calculating the number of tuples that satisfy the condition. The calculation is done by multiplying the count of 0s and 1s in the pre and suf arrays, respectively, for each bit position.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where n = 1 or the array contains only one element. It also correctly handles the case where the array contains duplicate elements.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
