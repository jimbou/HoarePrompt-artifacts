Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is 1 and the second element is 31, `i` is at least 31 and less than 32, `cur` is equal to `prefix[n]`, and `j` is 31.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

*   The value of `n` is at least 1.
*   The value of `i` is equal to `n`.
*   The `arr` list is empty.
*   The `prefix` list contains `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list.
*   The `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9).
*   The `pre` list is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`.
*   The `suf` list is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements. If `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), then `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0. Otherwise, the first element of the `j-th` list is 1 and the second element is 31.
*   The value of `i` is at least 31 and less than 32.
*   The value of `cur` is equal to `prefix[n]`.
*   The value of `j` is 31.
