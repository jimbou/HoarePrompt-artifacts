Output State: **n is at least n, i is n, arr is a list containing n elements, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original arr list and the previous element in the prefix list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the i-th list is 32 and the second element is n for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is n for other values of i if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 0 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 30 and the second element is 0 for other values of i, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where suf[j][1] is 0 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position (i.e., cur is odd), otherwise the first element of the j-th list is 0 and the second element is 0, cur is equal to prefix[0], j is 32, ans is equal to the sum of pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] for all k, y is equal to arr[i - 1], k is equal to y.bit_length() - 1, and c is equal to prefix[i].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows: The value of `n` remains the same, `i` is now equal to `n`, `arr` contains `n` elements, `prefix` contains `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list. The `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9). The `pre` list contains 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is `n` for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is `n` for other values of `i` if the `j-th` bit of `c` is 1, otherwise the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 30 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`. The `suf` list contains 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is 0 and the second element is 0. The value of `cur` is equal to `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, `ans` is equal to the sum of `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]` for all `k`, `y` is equal to `arr[i - 1]`, `k` is equal to `y.bit_length() - 1`, and `c` is equal to `prefix[i]`.
