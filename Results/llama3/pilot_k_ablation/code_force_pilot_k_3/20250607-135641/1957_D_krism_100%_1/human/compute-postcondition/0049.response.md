Output State: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 32 + `j` and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is 1 and the second element is 31, `cur` is equal to `prefix[n-1]`, `j` is 32. If `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), then `suf[j][1]` is 32 + `j` and other elements are 0. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1, and now `suf[j][0]` is `j` + 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates 32 times, and in each iteration, it checks if the current bit position `j` in the binary representation of `cur` is 1 (i.e., `cur` is odd). If it is, it increments the second element of the `j-th` list in `suf` by 1, making it 32 + `j`. If it is not, it increments the first element of the `j-th` list in `suf` by 1, making it `j` + 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
