Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), arr is a list of n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), prefix is a list containing a single element, 0, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

The first line reads an integer t from stdin and assigns it to n. The second line reads a list of n space-separated integers from stdin and assigns it to arr. The third line initializes a list prefix with a single element, 0. The remaining lines in stdin are not affected by the code snippet.
