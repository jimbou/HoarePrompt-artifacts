Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is `n` and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is `n` and the second element is 0, `cur` is equal to `prefix[0]`, `j` is 32, and `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is that a new variable `ans` has been introduced and assigned the value 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
