Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `i` is at least 31 and less than 32.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `pre` list has been updated such that the first element of each list is 32, indicating that the loop has executed 32 times. The `suf` list remains unchanged, and the other variables (`n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `stdin`) retain their initial values. The loop variable `i` is now at least 31 and less than 32, indicating that the loop has completed its final iteration.
