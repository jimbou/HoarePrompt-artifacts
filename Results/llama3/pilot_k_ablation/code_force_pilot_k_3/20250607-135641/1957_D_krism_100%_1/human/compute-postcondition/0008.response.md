Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original arr list and the previous element in the prefix list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `prefix`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code initializes two new lists, `pre` and `suf`, each containing 32 sublists with two elements initialized to 0. These new lists are added to the output state.
