Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `i` is at least 31 and less than 32.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n, 0, -1):
    cur = prefix[i]
    for j in range(32):
        if cur >> j & 1:
            suf[j][1] += 1
        else:
            suf[j][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is 1 and the second element is 31, `i` is at least 31 and less than 32, `cur` is equal to `prefix[n]`, and `j` is 31.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is 1 and the second element is 31, `cur` is equal to `prefix[n-1]`, `j` is 32. If `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), then `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1, and now `suf[j][0]` is 32.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n-2`, `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is 1 and the second element is 31, `cur` is equal to `prefix[n-2]`, `j` is 32.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `suf` list has been updated according to the bits of the `cur` value. If `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position, then `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0. Otherwise, `suf[j][0]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
