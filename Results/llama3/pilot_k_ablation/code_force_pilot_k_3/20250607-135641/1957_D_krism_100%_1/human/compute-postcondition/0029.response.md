Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is `n`, `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i`-th list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i`-th list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 3 and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j`-th bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j`-th list is 1 and the second element is 2, `i` is at least 31 and less than 32, `cur` is equal to `prefix[n]`, and `j` is 2. If `cur` has a 1 at the `j`-th bit position, `suf[j][1]` is 3 and other elements are 0. Otherwise, `suf[j][1]` is 2 and other elements are 0, and `suf[1][0]` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `suf[j][1]` has been incremented by 1. This means that if `cur` has a 1 at the `j`-th bit position, `suf[j][1]` is now 3, and otherwise it is now 2.
