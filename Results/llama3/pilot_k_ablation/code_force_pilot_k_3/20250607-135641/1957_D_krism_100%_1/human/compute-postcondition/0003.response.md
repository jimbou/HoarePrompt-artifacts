The only variable in the loop head is variable `v` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If `arr` has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `v` is the first integer in the list `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `v` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) that must have at least 2 integers, `prefix` is a list containing two elements, 0 and v ^ 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `v` is the second integer in the list `arr`**
