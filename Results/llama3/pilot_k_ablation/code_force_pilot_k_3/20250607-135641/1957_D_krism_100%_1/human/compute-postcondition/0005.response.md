To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `v` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 3 integers, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 integers, `v` is the second integer in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `arr` must have at least 3 integers, and `v` must be the third integer in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) that must have at least 3 integers, `prefix` is a list containing three elements, 0, v ^ 0, and v ^ (v ^ 0), `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `v` is the third integer in the list `arr`**
