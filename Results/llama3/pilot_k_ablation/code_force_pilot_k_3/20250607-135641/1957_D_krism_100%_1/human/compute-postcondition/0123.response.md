Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 3, arr is a list containing at least one element, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original arr list and the previous element in the prefix list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the i-th list is 32 and the second element is 1 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 1 for other values of i if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 0 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 30 and the second element is 0 for other values of i, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where suf[j][1] is n-32 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position (i.e., cur is odd), otherwise the first element of the j-th list is n and the second element is 0, cur is equal to prefix[0], j is 32, ans is equal to pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], y is equal to arr[i - 1], k is equal to y.bit_length() - 1, and c is equal to prefix[i]. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then pre[j][1] is incremented by 1 and suf[j][1] is decremented by 1. If the j-th bit of c is 0, then the first element of the i-th list in pre is 33 and the second element is 1 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 32 and the second element is 1 for other values of i, and the first element of the j-th list in suf is n-33 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position, otherwise the first element of the j-th list is n-1 and the second element is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only changes being in the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates 32 times, and in each iteration, it checks the j-th bit of c. If the j-th bit of c is 1, it increments pre[j][1] by 1 and decrements suf[j][1] by 1. If the j-th bit of c is 0, it sets the first element of the i-th list in pre to 33 and the second element to 1 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and sets the first element of the i-th list to 32 and the second element to 1 for other values of i, and sets the first element of the j-th list in suf to n-33 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position, otherwise sets the first element of the j-th list to n-1 and the second element to 0. After the loop finishes, j is 32, and the other variables remain unchanged.
