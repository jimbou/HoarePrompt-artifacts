To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. This indicates that the loop will iterate from `n` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 in each iteration.


Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:


* `n` is at least 1
* `i` is `n`
* `arr` is an empty list
* `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list
* `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9)
* `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`
* `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where `suf[j][1]` is 32 and other elements are 0 if `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), otherwise the first element of the `j-th` list is 1 and the second element is 31
* `i` is at least 31 and less than 32
* `cur` is equal to `prefix[n]`
* `j` is 31


To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop head and the current state:


* Since `i` is `n` at the end of the previous iteration, and the loop iterates from `n` down to 1, we need to decrement `i` by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `i` should be `n-1`.
* The other states (`arr`, `prefix`, `stdin`, `pre`, `suf`, `cur`, and `j`) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.
