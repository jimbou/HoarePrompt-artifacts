Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 1, arr is an empty list, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original arr list and the previous element in the prefix list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the i-th list is 32 and the second element is 1 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 1 for other values of i if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 0 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 30 and the second element is 0 for other values of i, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where suf[j][1] is n-32 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position (i.e., cur is odd), otherwise the first element of the j-th list is n and the second element is 0, cur is equal to prefix[0], j is 32, ans is equal to pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], y is equal to arr[i - 1], k is equal to y.bit_length() - 1, and c is equal to prefix[i].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* The value of `n` remains at least 1.
* The value of `i` remains 1.
* The `arr` list remains empty.
* The `prefix` list remains unchanged, containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list.
* The `stdin` input remains unchanged, containing `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
* The `pre` list is updated, where each element is a list of two elements. If the `j-th` bit of `c` is 1, the first element of the `i-th` list is 32 and the second element is 1 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 1 for other values of `i`. Otherwise, the first element of the `i-th` list is 31 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 30 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`.
* The `suf` list is updated, where each element is a list of two elements. If `cur` has a 1 at the `j-th` bit position (i.e., `cur` is odd), `suf[j][1]` is `n-32`. Otherwise, the first element of the `j-th` list is `n` and the second element is 0.
* The value of `cur` remains equal to `prefix[0]`.
* The value of `j` is 32.
* The value of `ans` remains equal to `pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1]`.
* The value of `y` remains equal to `arr[i - 1]`.
* The value of `k` remains equal to `y.bit_length() - 1`.
* The value of `c` remains equal to `prefix[i]`.
