Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 1 and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than 32**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `pre[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in it being equal to 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The `pre` list now contains 32 lists, each with the first element being either 0 or 1 (depending on the value of `i`) and the second element being 0.
