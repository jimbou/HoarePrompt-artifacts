Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) that must have at least 2 integers, `prefix` is a list containing three elements, 0, v ^ 0, and v ^ (v ^ 0), `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `v` is the second integer in the list `arr`**

In this output state, the value of `prefix` has been updated by appending a new element, which is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between `v` and the last element of `prefix` (which is `v ^ 0`). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
