State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n space-separated integers (1 <= a_i <= 10^9) that must have at least 1 integer, `prefix` is a list containing a single element, 0, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `v` is the first integer in the list `arr`**
