Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the list `arr` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `prefix` will contain `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list. The state of the other variables, `n` and `stdin`, remains unchanged.
