Output State: **n is at least 3, i is 3, arr is a list containing at least one element, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original arr list and the previous element in the prefix list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the i-th list is 32 and the second element is 1 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 1 for other values of i if the j-th bit of c is 1, otherwise the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 0 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 30 and the second element is 0 for other values of i, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where suf[j][1] is n-32 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position (i.e., cur is odd), otherwise the first element of the j-th list is n and the second element is 0, cur is equal to prefix[0], j is at least 1 and less than 32, ans is equal to pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1] + pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], y is equal to arr[i - 1], k is equal to y.bit_length() - 1, and c is equal to prefix[i]. If the j-th bit of c is 1, then pre[j][1] is incremented by 1 and suf[j][1] is decremented by 1. If the j-th bit of c is 0, then the first element of the i-th list in pre is 33 and the second element is 1 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 32 and the second element is 1 for other values of i, and the first element of the j-th list in suf is n-33 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position, otherwise the first element of the j-th list is n-1 and the second element is 0.**

The code modifies the pre and suf lists based on the value of the j-th bit of c. If the j-th bit of c is 1, pre[j][1] is incremented by 1 and suf[j][1] is decremented by 1. If the j-th bit of c is 0, the first element of the i-th list in pre is 33 and the second element is 1 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 32 and the second element is 1 for other values of i, and the first element of the j-th list in suf is n-33 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position, otherwise the first element of the j-th list is n-1 and the second element is 0. The values of n, i, arr, prefix, stdin, pre, suf, cur, j, ans, y, k, and c remain unchanged.
