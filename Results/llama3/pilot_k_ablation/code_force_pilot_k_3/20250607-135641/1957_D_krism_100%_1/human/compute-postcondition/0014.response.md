Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 3 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 2 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 2 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `i` is at least 2 and less than 32.**

In this output state, the value of `pre[i][0]` has been incremented by 1, resulting in a value of 3 for `i` at least 2 and less than 32. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
