Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original arr list and the previous element in the prefix list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(32):
    pre[i][0] += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 1 and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than 32

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 2 and the second element is 0, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than 32

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `prefix` is a list containing `n+1` elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original `arr` list and the previous element in the `prefix` list, `stdin` contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 10^5), followed by `n` space-separated integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (1 <= `a_i` <= 10^9), `pre` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the `i-th` list is 3 and the second element is 0 for `i` at least 2 and less than 32, and the first element of the `i-th` list is 2 and the second element is 0 for other values of `i`, `suf` is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements initialized to 0, `i` is at least 2 and less than 32.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
