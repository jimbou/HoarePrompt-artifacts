Output State: **n is at least 1, i is 1, arr is an empty list, prefix is a list containing n+1 elements, where the first element is 0 and the remaining elements are the result of the XOR operation between each element in the original arr list and the previous element in the prefix list, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), followed by n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), pre is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where the first element of the i-th list is 31 and the second element is 0 for i at least 31 and less than 32, and the first element of the i-th list is 30 and the second element is 0 for other values of i, suf is a list of 32 lists, each containing two elements, where suf[j][1] is n and other elements are 0 if cur has a 1 at the j-th bit position (i.e., cur is odd), otherwise the first element of the j-th list is n and the second element is 0, cur is equal to prefix[0], j is at least 0 and less than 32, ans is equal to pre[k][0] * suf[k][0] + pre[k][1] * suf[k][1], y is equal to arr[i - 1], k is equal to y.bit_length() - 1, and c is equal to prefix[i]. Additionally, the j-th bit of c is 0.**

The code modifies the pre and suf lists. The first line increments the first element of the j-th list in pre by 1, and the second line decrements the first element of the j-th list in suf by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
