This function reads input from stdin, where the first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4), followed by t lines, each containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and n space-separated integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). It calculates the sum of products of corresponding elements from two lists, pre and suf, which are updated based on the bits of the prefix and suffix values of the input integers. The function prints the calculated sum.
