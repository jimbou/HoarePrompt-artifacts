The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, otherwise `hd` remains 0.**
