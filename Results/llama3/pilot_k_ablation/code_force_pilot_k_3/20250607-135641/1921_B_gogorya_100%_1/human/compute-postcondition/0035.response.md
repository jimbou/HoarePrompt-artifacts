To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which means `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. 

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is 0**
