The code prints the sum of the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and half of the absolute difference between the number of positions where s1 and s2 differ and the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2.
Output: **res + abs(hd - res) // 2 (where res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the number of positions where s1 and s2 differ)**
