Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is n-1, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the number of positions where s1 and s2 differ.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all positions in the strings s1 and s2, and the variable hd now holds the total number of positions where the two strings differ. The other variables remain unchanged, with t still being an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ still being 2, stdin still containing t-3 test cases, n still being an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 and s2 still being strings of n characters ('0' or '1'), i being n-1, and res still being the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2.
