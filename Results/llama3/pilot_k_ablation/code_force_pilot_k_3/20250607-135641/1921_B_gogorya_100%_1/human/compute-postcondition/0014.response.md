Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `s1` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the total number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 10^4 and is greater than 0. The value of `_` is still 0. The number of test cases in `stdin` is `t-1`. The length of strings `s1` and `s2` is still `n`, which is between 1 and 10^5. The value of `i` is still `n-1`. The value of `hd` is still the total number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ. A new variable `res` is introduced, which is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.
