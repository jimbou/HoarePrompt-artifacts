Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is greater than 2, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 2, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `hd` is either 3 or 2. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is 3. Otherwise, `hd` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is now 3. Otherwise, `hd` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
