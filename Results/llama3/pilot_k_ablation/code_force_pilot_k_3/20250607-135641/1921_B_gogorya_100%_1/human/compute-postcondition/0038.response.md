Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, otherwise `hd` remains 0.***
