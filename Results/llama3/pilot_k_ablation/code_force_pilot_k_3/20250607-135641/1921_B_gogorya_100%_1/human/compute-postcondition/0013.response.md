Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `s1` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the total number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `t`, `_`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 10^5, and `s1` and `s2` are still strings of `n` characters consisting of '0's and '1's. The loop counter `i` has reached `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times. The variable `hd` now holds the total number of positions where the strings `s1` and `s2` differ.
