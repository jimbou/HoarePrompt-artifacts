Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is 1 plus its previous value (which was either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` were different).**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` remains between 1 and 10^4, the value of `_` remains 1, there are still t-2 test cases in stdin, the value of `n` remains greater than 1, the strings `s1` and `s2` remain unchanged, the value of `i` remains 1, the value of `res` remains the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and the value of `hd` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 1 or 2 depending on whether the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` were different.
