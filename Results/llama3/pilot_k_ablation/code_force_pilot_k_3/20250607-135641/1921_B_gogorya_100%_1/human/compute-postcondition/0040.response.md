Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is 2 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, otherwise `hd` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, otherwise it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
