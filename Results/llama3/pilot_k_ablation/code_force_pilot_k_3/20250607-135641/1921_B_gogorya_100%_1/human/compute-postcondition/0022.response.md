Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is 0, and res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2. If the characters at the current position i in s1 and s2 are different, then hd is 1, otherwise hd remains unchanged.***
