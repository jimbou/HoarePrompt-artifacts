Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 2, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` were different.***
