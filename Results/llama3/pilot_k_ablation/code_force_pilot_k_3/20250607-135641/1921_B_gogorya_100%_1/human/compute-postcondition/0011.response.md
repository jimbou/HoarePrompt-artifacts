Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` must be greater than 2, `s1` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 2, `hd` is increased by 1, if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `hd` is increased by 1, indicating that the difference between `s1` and `s2` at index `i` has been counted. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` being 0, `stdin` containing `t-1` test cases, `n` being an integer between 1 and 10^5 and greater than 2, `s1` and `s2` being strings of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), and `i` being 2.
