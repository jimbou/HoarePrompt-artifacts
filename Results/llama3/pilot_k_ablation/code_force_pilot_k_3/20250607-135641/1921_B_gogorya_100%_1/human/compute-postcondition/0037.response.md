Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is 1. The current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `hd` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `s1[i]` is still not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.
