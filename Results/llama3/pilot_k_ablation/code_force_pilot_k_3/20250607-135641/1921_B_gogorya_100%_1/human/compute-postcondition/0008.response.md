Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` must be greater than 1, `s1` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 1, `hd` is increased by 1**

The code increments the value of `hd` by 1. The initial state of `hd` is not specified, so we can only conclude that its value has increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
