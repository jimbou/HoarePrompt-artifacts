The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is n-1, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the total number of positions where the characters in s1 and s2 are different, and the value of the expression res + abs(hd - res) // 2 is being printed, which is the minimum number of operations required to make s1 and s2 identical**
