Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is 0. The current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`.**
