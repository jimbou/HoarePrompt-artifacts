The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 2, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is either 0 or 1 plus its previous value (which was either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` were different).**
