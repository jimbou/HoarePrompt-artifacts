Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), hd is 0**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not used or modified in the code. The stdin contains `t-1` test cases now, as one test case has been consumed by the code. The values of `n`, `s1`, and `s2` are updated based on the input provided for the current test case. The variable `hd` is initialized to 0.
