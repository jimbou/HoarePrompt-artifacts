Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, t is greater than 0, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is n-1, hd is 0, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        hd += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is 0, and res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2. If the characters at the current position i in s1 and s2 are different, then hd is 1, otherwise hd remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 1, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is either 0 or 1 plus its previous value (which was either 0 or 1 depending on whether the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` were different).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 2, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is either 0, 1, or 2 depending on whether the characters at the current position `i` in `s1` and `s2` were different.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
