Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the second line contains a string s of n characters ('0' or '1'), and the third line contains a string f of n characters ('0' or '1').
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    hd = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            hd += 1
    res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
    print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `s1` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is `n-1`, `hd` is the total number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and this is printed: `res + abs(hd - res) // 2` which is the sum of the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` and half of the absolute difference between the total number of positions where `s1` and `s2` differ and the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is n-1, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the total number of positions where the characters in s1 and s2 are different, and the value of the expression res + abs(hd - res) // 2 is being printed, which is the minimum number of operations required to make s1 and s2 identical

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4, _ is 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is n-1, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the number of positions where s1 and s2 differ, and this is printed: res + abs(hd - res) // 2 (where res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2 and hd is the number of positions where s1 and s2 differ)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
