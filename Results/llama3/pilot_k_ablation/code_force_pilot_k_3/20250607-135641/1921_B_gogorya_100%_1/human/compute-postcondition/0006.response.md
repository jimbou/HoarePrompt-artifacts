Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5, `n` must be greater than 0, `s1` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `s2` is a string of `n` characters ('0' or '1'), `i` is 0. If the current value of `s1[i]` is not equal to the current value of `s2[i]`, then `hd` is 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains unchanged.***
