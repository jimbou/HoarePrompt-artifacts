#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three lines: the first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5), the second line contains a string s of n characters ('0' or '1'), and the third line contains a string f of n characters ('0' or '1').
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        s1 = input()
        
        s2 = input()
        
        hd = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                hd += 1
        
        res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
        
        print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)
        
    #State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, _ is t-1, stdin contains 0 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 10^5, s1 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), s2 is a string of n characters ('0' or '1'), i is n-1, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the total number of positions where s1 and s2 differ, and the value of the expression res + abs(hd - res) // 2 is being printed, which is the minimum number of operations required to make s1 and s2 identical.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two binary strings. It calculates the minimum number of operations required to make the two strings identical and prints this value for each test case. The function accepts no parameters and returns no value, instead printing the results directly to the console.
