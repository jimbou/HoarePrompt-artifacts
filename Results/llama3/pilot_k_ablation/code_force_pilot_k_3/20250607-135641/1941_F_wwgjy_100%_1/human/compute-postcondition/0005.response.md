Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is infinity, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus `b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is equal to `k`, and `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values except for `s`, which is newly assigned the value of `f[k - 1] + b[0]`. This is because `j` is equal to `k` and `i` is 0, so `f[j - 1]` becomes `f[k - 1]` and `b[i]` becomes `b[0]`.
