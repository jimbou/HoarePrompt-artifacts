Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is infinity, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, i is equal to m, remain is not defined, j is not defined, s is not defined, and _ is 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `f[j - 1] + b[i] - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity. Otherwise, the program does not change its state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid - b[2]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[2]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[2]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[2])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[2]) - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
