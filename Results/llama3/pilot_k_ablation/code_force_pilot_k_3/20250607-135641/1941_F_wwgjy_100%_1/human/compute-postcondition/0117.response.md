Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of the current `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to `k`, `s` is an integer equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `res` has been updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. The other variables remain unchanged.
