Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains infinity, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus `b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1]` plus `b[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been updated to be equal to `f[j - 1]` plus `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
