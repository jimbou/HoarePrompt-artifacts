Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end` - `s`, `s` - `start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid` - `b[2]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid` - `b[2]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j - 1]` + `b[i]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to `f[j - 1]` + `b[i]`, where `j` is the insertion point of `mid` - `b[2]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and `i` is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
