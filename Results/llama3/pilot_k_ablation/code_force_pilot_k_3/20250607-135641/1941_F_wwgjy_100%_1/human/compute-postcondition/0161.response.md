Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[i - 1], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer. If j equals k, then s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is not equal to k, then s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[i - 1]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is updated to f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]. res is not equal to infinity***
