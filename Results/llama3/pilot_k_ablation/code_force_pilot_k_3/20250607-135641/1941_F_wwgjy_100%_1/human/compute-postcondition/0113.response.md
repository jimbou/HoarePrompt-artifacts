Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is inf, i is 0, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[i], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the code has introduced two new variables: `remain` and `j`. The value of `remain` is calculated as the difference between `mid` and `b[i]`, where `i` is 0. The value of `j` is determined by the insertion point of `remain` in the sorted list `f` to maintain sorted order, using the `bisect.bisect_left` function. All other variables remain unchanged, retaining their initial values and properties as specified in the precondition.
