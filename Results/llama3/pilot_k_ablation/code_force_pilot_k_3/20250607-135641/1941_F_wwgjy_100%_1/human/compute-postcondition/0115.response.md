Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is inf, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to `k`, `s` is an integer equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is calculated by adding the element at index `k - 1` in the sorted list `f` and the element at index `0` in the sorted list `b`. The value of `j` is equal to `k`, and the value of `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
