Output State: **The loop has executed all iterations, and the output state is determined by the values of the variables in the loop head and body.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is:

* The loop has finished executing, and the values of the variables in the loop head and body have been updated accordingly.
* The variable `_` has been incremented to the total number of test cases minus 1.
* The variable `i` has been incremented to the total number of iterations of the loop.
* The variable `remain` has been updated to the value of `mid - b[m - 1]`.
* The variable `j` has been updated to the insertion point of `mid - b[m - 1]` in `f` to maintain sorted order.
* The variable `s` has been updated to the value of `f[k - 1] + b[m - 1]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[m - 1]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[m - 1]`.
* If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end` is being printed.

Note that the state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
