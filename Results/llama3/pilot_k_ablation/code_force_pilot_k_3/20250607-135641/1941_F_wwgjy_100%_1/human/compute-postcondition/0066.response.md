Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is infinity, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order is not equal to `k`. The current value of `s` is greater than `start` and less than `end`.**
