Output: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is a finite value which is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, `i` is `m`, `remain` is `mid - b[m - 1]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid - b[m - 1]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[m - 1]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[m - 1]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[m - 1]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, and the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end` is being printed**
