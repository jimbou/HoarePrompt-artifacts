Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[i - 1], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer. If j equals k, then the current value of s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then the current value of res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is not equal to k, then the current value of s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[i - 1]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then the current value of res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is greater than or equal to 1, then the current value of s is updated to f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]. The current value of res is equal to infinity, and the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in a is being printed**
