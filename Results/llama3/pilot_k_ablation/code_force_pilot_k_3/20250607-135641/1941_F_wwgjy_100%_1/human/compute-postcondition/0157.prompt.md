Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is inf, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is an integer equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `i` is 1, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is an integer. If `j` equals `k`, then `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. Otherwise, `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `i` is 2, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, then `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is updated to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
