Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k (2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9, a_i < a_{i+1}). The third line contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, ..., d_m (1 <= d_i <= 10^9). The fourth line contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, ..., f_k (1 <= f_i <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is equal to `m`, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i - 1]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[i - 1]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]`. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is greater than or equal to 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `i` is `m`, `remain` is `mid - b[m - 1]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid - b[m - 1]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[m - 1]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[m - 1]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j] + b[m - 1]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in the list `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[i - 1], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer. If j equals k, then s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is not equal to k, then s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[i - 1]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is updated to f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]. If res is equal to infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in a is being printed. Otherwise, the value of res is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
