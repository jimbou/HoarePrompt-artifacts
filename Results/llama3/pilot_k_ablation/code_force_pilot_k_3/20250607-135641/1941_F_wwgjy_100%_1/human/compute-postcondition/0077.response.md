Output State: **n is an integer, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in a, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s which is less than end, otherwise res is infinity, i is 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is f[k - 1] + b[0] if j equals k, otherwise s is f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is f[j] + b[i], and _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `remain` and `j`. The first line calculates the value of `remain` by subtracting the value of `b[i]` from `mid`, and the second line finds the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order using the `bisect.bisect_left` function. The values of `s` and `res` are not directly modified by the code snippet, but their values depend on the values of `j` and `remain`, which are updated. The values of all other variables remain unchanged.
