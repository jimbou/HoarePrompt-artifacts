Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus `b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and `s` is an integer equal to `f[j]` plus `b[i]` if `j` is less than `k`, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[k - 1]` plus `b[0]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is updated to `f[j - 1]` plus `b[i]`.**
