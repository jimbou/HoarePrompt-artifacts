The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than int(input()), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, int(input()) is an integer. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and int(input()) must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs, `i` is equal to `m`, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i - 1]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[i - 1]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i - 1]`. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the difference between the first two consecutive elements in `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the minimum of the previous value of `res` and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` is printed.**
