Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the difference between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[2]`, `j` is the insertion point of `mid - b[2]` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[2]`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[2])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[2]) - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.**
