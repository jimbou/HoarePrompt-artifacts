t is a positive integer, n, m, and k are positive integers such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, 1 <= m, k <= 2 * 10^5, a is a list of n distinct integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 2 * 10^9 and a_i < a_{i+1}, d is a list of m integers such that 1 <= d_i <= 10^9, f is a list of k integers such that 1 <= f_i <= 10^9.
