#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a value of any type and value
    dp = {}
    return helper(x)
    #The program returns the result of the helper function with x as an argument, where x is a value of any type and value.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calls a helper function with a single argument x, where x can be of any type and value, and returns the result of that helper function call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: len is a non-negative integer.
    if (len <= 0) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1, which is an integer and a positive number.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer and is larger than 0
    if (len in dp) :
        return dp[len]
        #The program returns the value associated with the key 'len' in the dictionary 'dp', where 'len' is a non-negative integer larger than 0.
    #State: *len is a non-negative integer and is larger than 0, and len is not in dp
    x1 = helper(len - 1)
    x2 = 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2)
    y = x1 + x2
    dp[len] = y
    return y
    #The program returns y, which is the sum of x1 and x2. x1 is the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 1, and x2 is 2 times the product of len - 1 and the result of the helper function called with the argument len - 2.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns a value based on the input 'len', which is a non-negative integer. If 'len' is 0 or less, it returns 1. If 'len' is already a key in the dictionary 'dp', it returns the associated value. Otherwise, it calculates the value using recursive calls to the 'helper' function and stores it in 'dp' before returning it. The function effectively memoizes the results of the 'helper' function for different 'len' values.
