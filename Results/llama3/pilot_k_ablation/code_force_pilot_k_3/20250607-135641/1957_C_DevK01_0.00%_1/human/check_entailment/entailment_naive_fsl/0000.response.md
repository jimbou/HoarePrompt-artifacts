Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The problem description requires the program to consider the mirroring of moves by the computer and the fact that two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of color. However, the provided program does not take these factors into account.

The program only calculates the number of ways to place a single rook on the board, which is not the same as calculating the number of different final configurations possible after k moves. The program also does not consider the fact that the computer will mirror the moves made by the player, which affects the number of possible final configurations.

For example, if the input is n = 4 and k = 1, with the first move being (1, 2), the program will output 3, but the correct output should be 4, because there are four possible final configurations: (1, 2) and (2, 1), (1, 3) and (3, 1), (1, 4) and (4, 1), and (2, 2), (3, 3), (4, 4).
