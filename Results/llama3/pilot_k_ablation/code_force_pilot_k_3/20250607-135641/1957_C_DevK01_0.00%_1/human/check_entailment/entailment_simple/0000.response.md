Reasoning: 

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard. The program uses a recursive approach with memoization to calculate the number of possible configurations.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of the k moves and updates the size of the chessboard accordingly. If a move is not mirrored by the computer (i.e., the move is on the diagonal), it decrements the size of the chessboard by 1; otherwise, it decrements the size by 2.

After updating the size of the chessboard, the program calls the function `func_1` with the updated size as an argument. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code, but based on the context, it is likely that it calls the `helper` function with the updated size as an argument.

The `helper` function is a recursive function that calculates the number of possible configurations. It uses a dictionary `dp` to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations. If the size of the chessboard is 0 or less, it returns 1. If the size is already in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the stored result. Otherwise, it calculates the result by recursively calling itself with the size decremented by 1 and 2, and stores the result in the dictionary `dp`.

The program then prints the result of the `func_1` function, which is the number of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7.

Based on the given code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. It correctly updates the size of the chessboard based on the moves already played and uses a recursive approach with memoization to calculate the number of possible configurations.

Correctness: **True**
