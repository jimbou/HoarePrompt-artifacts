Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves. The game involves placing white and black rooks on an n x n chessboard such that no two rooks attack each other.

The provided program consists of two functions: func_1 and helper. The func_1 function initializes a dictionary dp and calls the helper function. The helper function calculates the number of possible configurations using dynamic programming.

The helper function takes the length of the remaining board as input and returns the number of possible configurations. It uses memoization to store the results of subproblems in the dp dictionary.

The base cases for the helper function are when the length is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns 1, and when the length is already in the dp dictionary, in which case it returns the stored result.

For other cases, the helper function calculates the number of possible configurations by considering two possibilities:

1.  Placing a white rook on the current position and a black rook on the mirrored position. This reduces the problem to a smaller subproblem of length len - 1.
2.  Placing a white rook on the current position and a black rook on a different position. This reduces the problem to a smaller subproblem of length len - 2, and there are 2 \* (len - 1) ways to choose the position for the black rook.

The helper function calculates the number of possible configurations by adding the results of these two possibilities and stores the result in the dp dictionary.

The func_1 function calls the helper function with the initial length of the board and returns the result.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The program does not correctly handle the case when the computer cannot mirror the player's move (i.e., when r = c). In this case, the computer skips its turn, and the player can place another rook on the same position. This is not accounted for in the program.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
