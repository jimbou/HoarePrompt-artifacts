Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the number of different final configurations possible in a game of placing white and black rooks on a chessboard, where no two rooks can attack each other.

The program first reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard (n) and the number of moves already played (k). It then reads the coordinates of the k moves.

The program then calculates the number of remaining valid moves by subtracting 2 from n for each move where the row and column are different, and subtracting 1 from n for each move where the row and column are the same.

The program then calls the function `func_1` with the remaining number of valid moves as an argument, and prints the result.

The function `func_1` is a recursive function that calculates the number of possible final configurations using dynamic programming. It uses a dictionary `dp` to store the results of subproblems, and calculates the result for a given length `len` by recursively calling itself with `len-1` and `len-2` as arguments.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations by considering all possible moves that can be made from the current state, and summing up the number of possible configurations for each move.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
