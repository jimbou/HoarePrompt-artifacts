Output State: **len is a non-negative integer and is larger than 0, and len is not in dp, dp[len] is x1 + x2, x1 is helper(len - 1), x2 is 2 * (len - 1) * helper(len - 2), y is x1 + x2**

In this output state, the value of `len` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not in `dp`. The code introduces new variables `x1`, `x2`, and `y`, and updates the value of `dp[len]`. The value of `x1` is set to the result of `helper(len - 1)`, and the value of `x2` is set to twice the product of `len - 1` and the result of `helper(len - 2)`. The value of `y` is the sum of `x1` and `x2`, which is also assigned to `dp[len]`.
