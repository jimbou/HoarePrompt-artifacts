Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the value of n.

The program then prints the pairs of numbers that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The pairs are printed in a specific pattern, starting with (1, 1) and (1, 2), followed by pairs of numbers from 3 to n+1, where each number is printed twice.

However, upon closer inspection, it appears that the program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The program prints the same pairs of numbers for all values of n, which is not correct. The correct solution should print different pairs of numbers for different values of n.

For example, for n = 3, the program should print the pairs (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1), but the program prints (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4) instead.

Therefore, the given program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
