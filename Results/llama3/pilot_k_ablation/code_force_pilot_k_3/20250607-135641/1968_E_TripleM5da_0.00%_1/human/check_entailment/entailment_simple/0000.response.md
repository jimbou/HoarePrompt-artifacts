Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints out a set of points that are supposed to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program is not actually solving the problem correctly. The program simply prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and then a series of points of the form (i, i) for i ranging from 3 to n + 1. This does not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

In fact, the program's output does not even depend on the input n, except for the number of points printed. This suggests that the program is not actually using the input n to solve the problem, but rather is simply printing out a predetermined set of points.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
