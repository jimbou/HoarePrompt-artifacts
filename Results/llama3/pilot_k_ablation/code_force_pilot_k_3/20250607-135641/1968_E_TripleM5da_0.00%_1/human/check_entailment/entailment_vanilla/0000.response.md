Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by printing out a set of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes apparent that the program is not correctly implementing the solution. The program is printing out points in a specific pattern, but it is not considering the actual Manhattan distances between the points.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (1, 2) is 1, and the Manhattan distance between (1, 1) and (3, 3) is 4. This means that the set of distinct Manhattan distances is not maximized.

Furthermore, the program is not handling the case when n is even correctly. When n is even, the program prints out points in a pattern that does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Therefore, the given program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
