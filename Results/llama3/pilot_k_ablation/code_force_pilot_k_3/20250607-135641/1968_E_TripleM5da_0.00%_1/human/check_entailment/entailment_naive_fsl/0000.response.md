Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, the correct output should be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

This is because the program is not correctly implementing the strategy to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The correct strategy is to place the points in a way that maximizes the number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points. The program's current implementation does not achieve this.

In the given example, the program's output results in a set of Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2}, whereas the correct output results in a set of Manhattan distances {0, 1, 2, 3}, which is larger. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
