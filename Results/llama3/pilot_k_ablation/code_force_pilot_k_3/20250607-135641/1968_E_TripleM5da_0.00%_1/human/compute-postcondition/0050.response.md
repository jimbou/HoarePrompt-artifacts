Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., `n + 1`, `n + 1`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is `n + 2` is being printed twice.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now `n + 2`, and the value of `n` remains unchanged. The input in stdin is still the same, and the output printed includes the initial 1, 2, followed by the pairs of numbers from 3 to `n + 1`, each number printed twice.
