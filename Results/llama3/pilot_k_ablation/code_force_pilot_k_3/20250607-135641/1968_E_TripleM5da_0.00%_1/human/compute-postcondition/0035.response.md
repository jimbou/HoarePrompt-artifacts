Based on the initial state, `i` is `n + 3`, and `n` is an integer greater than `n + 3` and is between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). However, this creates a contradiction, as `n` cannot be greater than `n + 3`. Therefore, we will assume that the initial state is incorrect, and `n` is actually less than `n + 3`.

The `print` statement simply prints the values `1` and `1`, without using any variables or objects. Therefore, the output will be:

Output: **1 1**
