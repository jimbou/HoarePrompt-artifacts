Functionality: **This function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent input is an integer (n) representing the number of pairs to print. The function then prints a series of pairs of numbers, starting with (1, 1) and (1, 2), followed by pairs of numbers from 3 to n+1, where each number is printed twice. The function repeats this process for each test case.**
