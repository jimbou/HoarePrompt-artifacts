The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2` and greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is at least 5, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive) and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i` - 2 so `n` is greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`i` is at least 5, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is at least 5 is being printed twice**
