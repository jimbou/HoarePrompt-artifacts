Based on the initial state, `i` is at least 5 and `n` is greater than or equal to 5.

The print statement is `print(i, i)`, which means it will print the value of `i` twice.

Since `i` is at least 5, its value could be 5 or any integer greater than 5. However, the exact value of `i` is not specified.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` printed twice.

Output: **i, i (where i is at least 5)**
