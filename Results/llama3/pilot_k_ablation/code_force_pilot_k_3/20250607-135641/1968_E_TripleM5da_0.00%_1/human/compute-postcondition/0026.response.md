According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2` and `i` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 4 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5. 
State: **`i` is at least 5, `n` is greater than or equal to 5**
