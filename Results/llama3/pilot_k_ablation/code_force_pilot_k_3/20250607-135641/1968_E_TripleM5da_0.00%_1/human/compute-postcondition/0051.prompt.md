Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 2):
        print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains one input: t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., `n + 1`, `n + 1`.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now `n + 2`, and the value of `n` remains unchanged. The input in stdin is still the same, and the output printed includes the initial 1, 2, followed by the pairs of numbers from 3 to `n + 1`, each number printed twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., `n + 1`, `n + 1`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is `n + 2` is being printed twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `i` is at least `n + 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is at least `n + 2` is being printed twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
