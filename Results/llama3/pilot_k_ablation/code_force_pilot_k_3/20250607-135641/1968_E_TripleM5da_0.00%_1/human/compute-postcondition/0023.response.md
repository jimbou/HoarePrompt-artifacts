To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, so we need to adjust `n` to be greater than 0. Additionally, since `i` is initialized to `n + 3`, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 4 (since `n` is at least 1).

State: **`i` is at least 4, `n` is greater than 0**
