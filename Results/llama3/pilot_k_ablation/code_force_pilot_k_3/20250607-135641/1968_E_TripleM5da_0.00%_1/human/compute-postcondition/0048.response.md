Output State: `i` is at least `n + 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is at least `n + 2` is being printed twice.

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be at least `n + 2`, and the value of `n` will still be between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). The input from stdin will still be empty, and the output will include the initial values 1 and 2, followed by the value of `i` (which is at least `n + 2`) printed twice.
