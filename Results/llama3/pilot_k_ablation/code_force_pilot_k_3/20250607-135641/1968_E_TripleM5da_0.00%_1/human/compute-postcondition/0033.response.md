The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the input. If `i` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is `n + 3` and for the loop to execute again the input must be greater than `n + 3`. Also, the stdin must contain the input.
State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains an integer greater than `n + 3`**
