The code `n = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. The initial state specifies that stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3). Since `n` is assigned the value of the first integer input, the value of `n` is now between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains one input: t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3).

Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains one input: t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3)**
