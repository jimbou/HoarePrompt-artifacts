According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 2, stdin contains one input: t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 3, 3**
