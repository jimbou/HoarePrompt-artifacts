Output State: **`i` is at least `n + 2`, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is at least `n + 2` is being printed twice.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `i` has reached a value of at least `n + 2`, where `n` remains an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). The standard input remains empty, and the output includes the initial print of "1, 2" followed by the value of `i` (which is at least `n + 2`) printed twice.
