Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains one input: t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., `n + 1`, `n + 1`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `n + 2`, and the variable `n` remains unchanged within the range of 1 to 50. The input in stdin remains the same, containing t integers within the range of 2 to 10^3. The output printed includes the initial 1, 2, followed by pairs of numbers from 3 to `n + 1`, each number repeated twice.
