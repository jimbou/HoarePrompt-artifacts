Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., `n + 1`, `n + 1`, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is `n + 2` is being printed twice.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and the value of `n` will still be an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). The loop will have printed the sequence of numbers from 3 to `n + 1`, with each number printed twice, and then printed the number 1 twice. The final value of `i` will be `n + 2`, which will be printed twice.
