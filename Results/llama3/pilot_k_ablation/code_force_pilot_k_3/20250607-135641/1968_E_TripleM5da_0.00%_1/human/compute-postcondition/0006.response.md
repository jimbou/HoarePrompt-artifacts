The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 3 and n is greater than 3.
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, stdin contains one input: t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2**
