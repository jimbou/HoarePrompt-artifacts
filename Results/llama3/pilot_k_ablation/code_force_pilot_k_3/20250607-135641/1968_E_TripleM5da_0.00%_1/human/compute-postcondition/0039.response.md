To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


1. The loop iterates over the range from 3 to `n + 2`. For the loop to execute, `n + 2` must be greater than or equal to 3.


2. Since `n` is an integer greater than `n + 3`, we know that `n` is at least 4.


3. The initial value of `i` is `n + 3`, which is greater than `n + 2`. However, for the loop to execute, `i` should be within the range from 3 to `n + 2`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to be at least 3.


Considering these adjustments, the updated state before the loop starts is:


State: **`i` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2**
