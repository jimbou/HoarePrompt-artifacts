Output State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` is an integer greater than `n + 3` and is between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be an integer greater than `n + 3`, which means it is now greater than its original value plus 3. The value of `i` is still `n + 3`, but since `n` has changed, the value of `i` is now `n + 3` where `n` is the new value. The stdin is now empty since an integer has been read from it.
