To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 2):`. The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 3, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive).

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 2`. Since `i` is at least 3, we can increment it by 1 to make it 4 or more. 

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`i` is at least 4, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the value of `i` which is at least 4 is being printed twice**
