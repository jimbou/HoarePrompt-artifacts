To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state after the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The variables in the loop head are `i` and the input value from `stdin`, which is used to determine the range of the loop.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `i` is `n + 2`
* `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive)
* `stdin` contains one input: `t` integers (2 <= `n` <= 10^3)
* The output printed includes the initial 1, 2, followed by the pairs of numbers from 3 to `n + 1`, each number printed twice.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

* `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to execute the next iteration.
* The input value from `stdin` remains the same, as it is not changed by the loop.
* The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains one input: `t` integers (2 <= `n` <= 10^3), and this is printed: 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, ..., `n + 1`, `n + 1**, `n + 2**
