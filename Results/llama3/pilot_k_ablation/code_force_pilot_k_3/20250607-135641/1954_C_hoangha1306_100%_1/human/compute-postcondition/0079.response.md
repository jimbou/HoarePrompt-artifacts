Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string of input, i is 1, kq1 is a string that has a[i] appended to it, kq2 is a string that has a[i] appended to it.**

Explanation: The code block consists of three lines. The first line appends the character at index `i` of string `a` to the string `kq1`. The second line appends the same character to the string `kq2`. The third line is a `continue` statement, which does not affect the state of any variables. Since `i` is 1, the character appended to `kq1` and `kq2` is the second character of string `a`. The values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged.
