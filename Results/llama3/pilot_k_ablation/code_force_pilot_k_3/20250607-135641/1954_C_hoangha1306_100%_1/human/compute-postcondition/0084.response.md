Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are appended with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 1 of string `a` and the integer at index 1 of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 1 of string `a` and the integer at index 1 of string `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is appended with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is appended with the string representation of `x`. Otherwise, `kq1` is appended with the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is appended with the string representation of `y`.***
