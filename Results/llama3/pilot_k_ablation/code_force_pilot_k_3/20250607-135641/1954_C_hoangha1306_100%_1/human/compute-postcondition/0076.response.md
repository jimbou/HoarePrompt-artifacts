Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 0, and the character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`. `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is a string containing the minimum integer value of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the maximum integer value of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, and `vt` is 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is a string containing the maximum integer value of the character at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, `kq2` is a string containing the minimum integer value of the character at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, and `vt` is not equal to 0. In both cases, `kq1` and `kq2` are not being printed.**
