Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 1, `kq1` is the character at index 1 of `a`, `kq2` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b`, and `vt` is 1 if the initial value of `vt` is 0, otherwise `vt` is not equal to 0, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 1000, `q` is still 1, `x` and `y` are assigned the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the characters at index 1 of strings `a` and `b` respectively, `a` and `b` are still strings of input, `i` is still 1, `kq1` and `kq2` are still strings containing the character at index 1 of `a` and the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index 1 of strings `a` and `b` respectively, and `vt` is either 1 or not equal to 0 depending on its initial value. The stdin still contains 2 pairs of integers.
