Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the character at index i of string a, vt is 0, and stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y. If a[i] does not equal b[i], then x is the minimum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], y is the maximum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], vt is 1, and stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y. If vt is 0, then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the character at index i of string a. If vt is 1, then kq1 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the string representation of y, and kq2 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the string representation of x.***
