Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index `i` of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index `i` of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index `i` of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index `i` of string `b`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string of input, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `i` is 0, `kq1` is not printed, and `kq2` is not printed. Additionally, the character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`, and stdin contains 2 pairs of integers x and y.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variables `x` and `y` have been assigned the minimum and maximum integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 2 pairs of integers x and y.
