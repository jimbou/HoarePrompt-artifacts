The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be a string of input that must have at least 2 characters.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 1**
