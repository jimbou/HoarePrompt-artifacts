Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 2. If the third character of `a` is equal to the third character of `b`, then `kq1` is `kq1` plus the third character of `a` and `kq2` is `kq2` plus the third character of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.***
