Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, i is equal to the length of the initial string a.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q remains 0, stdin is empty, a and b are empty strings, kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, and i is equal to the length of the initial string a.
