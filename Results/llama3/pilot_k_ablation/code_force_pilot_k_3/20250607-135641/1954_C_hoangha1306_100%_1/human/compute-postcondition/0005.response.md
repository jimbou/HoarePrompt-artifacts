Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string containing the character at index i of string a, kq2 is a string containing the character at index i of string a, vt is 0, i is 0. The current value of a at index i is equal to the current value of b at index i.**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line appends the character at index i of string a to the string kq1. The second line appends the character at index i of string a to the string kq2. The third line is a continue statement, which does not affect any variables. 

Since the value of a at index i is equal to the value of b at index i, both kq1 and kq2 will contain the same character. No other variables are affected by the code block.
