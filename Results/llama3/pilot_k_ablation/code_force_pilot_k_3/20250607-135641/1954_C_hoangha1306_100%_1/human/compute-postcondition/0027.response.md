Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2. If the third digit of `a` is equal to the third digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each incremented by the third digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is incremented by the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is incremented by the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, then `kq1` is incremented by the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is incremented by the string representation of `y`.***
