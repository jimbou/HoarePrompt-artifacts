Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, i is 0, a[i] is not equal to b[i], x is the minimum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], and y is the maximum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i].**

In this output state, the values of x and y are determined by the minimum and maximum of the integer values of a[i] and b[i], respectively. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin now contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y.
