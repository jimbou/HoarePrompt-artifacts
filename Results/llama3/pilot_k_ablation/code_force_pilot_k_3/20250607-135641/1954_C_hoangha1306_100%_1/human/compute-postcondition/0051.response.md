Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `x` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 1, `kq1` is the character at index 1 of `a` plus the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b` as a string if `vt` is 0, otherwise `kq1` is the character at index 1 of `a` plus the string representation of `y`, `kq2` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b` as a string plus the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b` as a string if `vt` is 0, otherwise `kq2` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string `b` plus the string representation of `x`, and `vt` is 1 if the initial value of `vt` is 0, otherwise `vt` is not equal to 0, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers.**
