Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string of input, i is 1, if a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 is a string containing the character at index 1 of a and the character at index 1 of a, kq2 is a string containing the minimum and maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b and the character at index 1 of a, and vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0. If a[i] does not equal b[i], then x is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b, kq1 is the character at index 1 of a plus the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b as a string if vt is 0, otherwise kq1 is the character at index 1 of a plus the string representation of y, kq2 is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b as a string plus the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b as a string if vt is 0, otherwise kq2 is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b plus the string representation of x, and vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers.**
