Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1, x is the minimum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], y is the maximum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i]. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string containing the character at index i of string a if a[i] equals b[i], otherwise kq1 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the string representation of x. Also, kq2 is a string containing the character at index i of string a if a[i] equals b[i], otherwise kq2 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the string representation of y. If vt is 1, then kq1 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the value of y, and kq2 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the value of x. vt is 1 if a[i] does not equal b[i], otherwise vt is 0. stdin contains t-2 pairs of integers x and y if a[i] equals b[i], otherwise stdin contains t-4 pairs of integers x and y.**
