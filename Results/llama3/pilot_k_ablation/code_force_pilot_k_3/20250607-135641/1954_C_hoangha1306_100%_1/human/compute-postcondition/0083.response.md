Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, x is the minimum of the integer at index 1 of string a and the integer at index 1 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer at index 1 of string a and the integer at index 1 of string b, a is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string of input, i is 1, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y.***
