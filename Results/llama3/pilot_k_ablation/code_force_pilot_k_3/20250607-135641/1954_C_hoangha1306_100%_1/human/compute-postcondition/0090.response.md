Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, b is a string of input, i is 2, x is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of strings a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of strings a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y. Otherwise, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.***
