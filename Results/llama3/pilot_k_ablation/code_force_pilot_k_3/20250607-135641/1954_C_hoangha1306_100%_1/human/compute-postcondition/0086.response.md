Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, b is a string of input, i is 2, kq1 is kq1 plus the third character of a, kq2 is kq2 plus the third character of a**

The code block modifies the values of `kq1` and `kq2` by appending the third character of string `a` to them. The value of `i` is used to index into string `a`, and since `i` is 2, the third character of `a` is appended to `kq1` and `kq2`. The `continue` statement does not affect the state of the program. All other variables remain unchanged.
