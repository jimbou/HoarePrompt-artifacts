Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 1 character, b is a string of input, i is 0. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string containing the first character of a, kq2 is a string containing the first character of a, vt is 0, and kq1 and kq2 are not being printed. If the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, then x is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b, and y is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string containing the minimum integer value of the characters at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string containing the maximum integer value of the characters at index i of strings a and b, and vt is 1. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string containing the maximum integer value of the character at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string containing the minimum integer value of the character at index i of strings a and b, and vt is not equal to 0. In both cases, kq1 and kq2 are not being printed.***
