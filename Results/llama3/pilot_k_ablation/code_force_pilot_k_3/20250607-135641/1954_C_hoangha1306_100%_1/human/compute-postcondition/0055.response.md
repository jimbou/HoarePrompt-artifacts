Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `vt`, `vt` is 1 if the initial value of `vt` is 0, otherwise `vt` is not equal to 0, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `x` and `y` are updated to be the minimum and maximum of the integer values of the characters at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `kq1` and `kq2` depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `vt`, and are updated accordingly. The value of `vt` is updated to be 1 if its initial value is 0, otherwise it remains not equal to 0. The stdin still contains 2 pairs of integers.
