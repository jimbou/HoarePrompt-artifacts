Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, x is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x.**

The code snippet appends the string representation of `y` to `kq1` and the string representation of `x` to `kq2`. The values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The original values of `kq1` and `kq2` are not specified, so their final values are described in terms of their original values.
