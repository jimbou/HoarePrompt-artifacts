Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, a is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, b is a string of input, i is 2, x is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b, kq1 is a string that depends on the values of a, b, x, y, and vt and has been appended with the string representation of y, kq2 is a string that depends on the values of a, b, x, y, and vt and has been appended with the string representation of x, vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `i`, `x`, `y`, and `vt` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `kq1` and `kq2` are updated by appending the string representations of `y` and `x` respectively. The stdin remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.
