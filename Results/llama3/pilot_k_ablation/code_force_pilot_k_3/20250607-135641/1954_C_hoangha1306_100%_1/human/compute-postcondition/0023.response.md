Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variables `x` and `y` are assigned the minimum and maximum values of the integers at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. Since `a` and `b` are strings of digits from 1 to 9, the values of `x` and `y` will be integers between 1 and 9.
