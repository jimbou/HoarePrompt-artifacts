Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is a string consisting of one digit from 1 to 9, kq2 is a string consisting of one digit from 1 to 9, vt is not equal to 0, i is 0, a[i] is not equal to b[i], x is the minimum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], and y is the maximum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i].**

In this output state, the values of t, q, a, b, vt, i, x, and y remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The stdin now contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y, as two pairs have been read and processed. The variables kq1 and kq2, which were initially empty strings, now contain one digit each: kq1 contains the maximum digit y, and kq2 contains the minimum digit x.
