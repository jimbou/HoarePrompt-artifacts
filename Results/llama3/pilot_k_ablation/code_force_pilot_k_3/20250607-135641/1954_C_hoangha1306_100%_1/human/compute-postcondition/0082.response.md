Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, x is the minimum of the integer at index 1 of string a and the integer at index 1 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer at index 1 of string a and the integer at index 1 of string b, a is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string of input, i is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The only changes are to `kq1` and `kq2`, which are appended with the string representations of `y` and `x`, respectively.
