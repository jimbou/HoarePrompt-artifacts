The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the stdin and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length. After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`. The value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive). The values of `x` and `y` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.**
