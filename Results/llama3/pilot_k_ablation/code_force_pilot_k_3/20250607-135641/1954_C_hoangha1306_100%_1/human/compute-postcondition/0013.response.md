Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y if a[i] equals b[i], otherwise stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, if a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the character at index i of string a, otherwise kq1 and kq2 are strings containing one digit from 1 to 9, vt is 0 if a[i] equals b[i], otherwise vt is 1, i is 0, and if a[i] is not equal to b[i], then x is the minimum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], and y is the maximum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i].**
