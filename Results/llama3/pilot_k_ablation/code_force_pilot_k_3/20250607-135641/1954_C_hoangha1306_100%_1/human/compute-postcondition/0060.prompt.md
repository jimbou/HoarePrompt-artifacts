Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input, b is a string of input, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, i is equal to the length of the initial string a, kq1 is not printed, and kq2 is not printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 1 character, b is a string of input. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the character at index i of a. Otherwise, x is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index i of string a and the integer value of the character at index i of string b, y is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index i of string a and the integer value of the character at index i of string b, kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the minimum and maximum of the integer value of the character at index i of string a and the integer value of the character at index i of string b respectively, and vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0. In both cases, i is 0, and kq1 and kq2 are not printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, b is a string of input, i is 1, if a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 is a string containing the character at index 1 of a and the character at index 1 of a, kq2 is a string containing the minimum and maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b and the character at index 1 of a, and vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0. If a[i] does not equal b[i], then x is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b, kq1 is the character at index 1 of a plus the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b as a string if vt is 0, otherwise kq1 is the character at index 1 of a plus the string representation of y, kq2 is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b as a string plus the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b as a string if vt is 0, otherwise kq2 is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 1 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 1 of string b plus the string representation of x, and vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, b is a string of input, i is 2. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 is a string containing the character at index 2 of a, the character at index 2 of a, and the character at index 2 of a, kq2 is a string containing the minimum and maximum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b and the character at index 2 of a, and vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0. If a[i] does not equal b[i], then x is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b, y is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b, kq1 is the character at index 2 of a plus the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b as a string if vt is 0, otherwise kq1 is the character at index 2 of a plus the string representation of y, kq2 is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b as a string plus the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b as a string if vt is 0, otherwise kq2 is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string a and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string b plus the string representation of x, and vt is 1 if the initial value of vt is 0, otherwise vt is not equal to 0, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
