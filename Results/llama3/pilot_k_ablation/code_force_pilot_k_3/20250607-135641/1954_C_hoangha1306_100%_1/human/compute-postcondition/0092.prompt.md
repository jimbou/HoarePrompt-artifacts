Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input, b is a string of input, i is equal to the length of the initial string a, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0, kq1 is not being printed, and kq2 is not being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input that must have at least 1 character, b is a string of input, i is 0. If the character at index i of string a is equal to the character at index i of string b, then kq1 is a string containing the first character of a, kq2 is a string containing the first character of a, vt is 0, and kq1 and kq2 are not being printed. If the character at index i of string a is not equal to the character at index i of string b, then x is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b, and y is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index i of strings a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is a string containing the minimum integer value of the characters at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string containing the maximum integer value of the characters at index i of strings a and b, and vt is 1. If vt is not 0, then kq1 is a string containing the maximum integer value of the character at index i of strings a and b, kq2 is a string containing the minimum integer value of the character at index i of strings a and b, and vt is not equal to 0. In both cases, kq1 and kq2 are not being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 1. If `a[i]` is equal to `b[i]`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are appended with `a[i]`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 1 of string `a` and the integer at index 1 of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 1 of string `a` and the integer at index 1 of string `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is appended with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is appended with the string representation of `x`. Otherwise, `kq1` is appended with the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is appended with the string representation of `y`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 2. If the third character of `a` is equal to the third character of `b`, then `kq1` is `kq1` plus the third character of `a` and `kq2` is `kq2` plus the third character of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `y`. Otherwise, `kq1` is the original value of `kq1` plus the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is the original value of `kq2` plus the string representation of `x`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
