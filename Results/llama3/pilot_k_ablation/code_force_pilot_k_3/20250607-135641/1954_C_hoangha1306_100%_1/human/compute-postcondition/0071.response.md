Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 1 character, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 0, `kq1` is an empty string, `kq2` is an empty string, `vt` is 0, `kq1` is not being printed, and `kq2` is not being printed. Additionally, the character at index `i` of string `a` is not equal to the character at index `i` of string `b`. `x` is the minimum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`, and `y` is the maximum of the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` are determined by the integer values of the characters at index `i` of strings `a` and `b`. Since `i` is 0, the characters at index `i` are the first characters of strings `a` and `b`. The integer values of these characters are compared, and the minimum value is assigned to `x`, while the maximum value is assigned to `y`. The other variables remain unchanged.
