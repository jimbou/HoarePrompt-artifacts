Functionality: **This function reads a series of pairs of strings from standard input, where each string consists of digits from 1 to 9 and has the same length as its pair. For each pair, it generates two new strings by alternating between the minimum and maximum digit values at each position, starting with the minimum value for the first pair and the maximum value for the second pair. The function then prints these two strings. The process is repeated for the number of pairs specified by the first integer read from standard input, which is between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).**
