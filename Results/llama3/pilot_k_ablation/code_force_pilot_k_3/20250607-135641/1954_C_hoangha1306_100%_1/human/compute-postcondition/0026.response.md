Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 2, x is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of a and b, y is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of a and b. If vt is 0, then kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of y, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of x. Otherwise, vt is 1, kq1 is the original value of kq1 plus the string representation of x, and kq2 is the original value of kq2 plus the string representation of y.***
