Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 1, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `a` and the integer value of the character at index 2 of string `b`, `kq1` and `kq2` are strings that depend on the values of `a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, and `vt`. If `vt` is 0, `vt` is set to 1. Otherwise, `kq1` is appended with the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is appended with the string representation of `x`. `stdin` contains 2 pairs of integers.***
