Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, kq1 is an empty string, kq2 is an empty string, vt is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] == b[i]:
        kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
        kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
        continue
    else:
        x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
        if vt == 0:
            vt = 1
            kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
        else:
            kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
            kq2 = kq2 + str(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y if a[i] equals b[i], otherwise stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 1 digit, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, if a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the character at index i of string a, otherwise kq1 and kq2 are strings containing one digit from 1 to 9, vt is 0 if a[i] equals b[i], otherwise vt is 1, i is 0, and if a[i] is not equal to b[i], then x is the minimum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], and y is the maximum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, a is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, b is a string of digits from 1 to 9, i is 1. If a[i] equals b[i], then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the character at index i of string a, vt is 0, and stdin contains t-1 pairs of integers x and y. If a[i] does not equal b[i], then x is the minimum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], y is the maximum of the integer value of a[i] and the integer value of b[i], vt is 1, and stdin contains t-3 pairs of integers x and y. If vt is 0, then kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the character at index i of string a. If vt is 1, then kq1 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the string representation of y, and kq2 is a string containing one digit from 1 to 9 followed by the string representation of x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 0, `a` is a string of digits from 1 to 9 that must have at least 2 digits, `b` is a string of digits from 1 to 9, `i` is 2. If the third digit of `a` is equal to the third digit of `b`, then `kq1` and `kq2` are each incremented by the third digit of `a`. Otherwise, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of `a` and `b`. If `vt` is 0, then `kq1` is incremented by the string representation of `y` and `kq2` is incremented by the string representation of `x`. If `vt` is 1, then `kq1` is incremented by the string representation of `x` and `kq2` is incremented by the string representation of `y`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
