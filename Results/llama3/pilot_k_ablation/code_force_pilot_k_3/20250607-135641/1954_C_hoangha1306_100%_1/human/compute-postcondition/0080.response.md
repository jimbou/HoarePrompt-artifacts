Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 1 of string `a` and the integer at index 1 of string `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 1 of string `a` and the integer at index 1 of string `b`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 2 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 1, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the minimum and maximum values of the integers at index 1 of strings `a` and `b`, respectively. The stdin still contains 0 pairs of integers.
