Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), `q` is 2, `stdin` contains 0 pairs of integers `x` and `y`, `a` is a string of input that must have at least 3 characters, `b` is a string of input, `i` is 2, `x` is the minimum of the integer at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`, `y` is the maximum of the integer at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The new variables `x` and `y` are assigned the minimum and maximum values of the integers at index 2 of strings `a` and `b`, respectively.
