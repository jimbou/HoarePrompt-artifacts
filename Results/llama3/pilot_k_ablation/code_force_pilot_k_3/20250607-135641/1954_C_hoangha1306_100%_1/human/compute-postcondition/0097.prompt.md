Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` pairs of integers `x` and `y`, where `x` and `y` are strings of digits from 1 to 9 and have the same length.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    a = input()
    b = input()
    kq1 = ''
    kq2 = ''
    vt = 0
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if a[i] == b[i]:
            kq1 = kq1 + a[i]
            kq2 = kq2 + a[i]
            continue
        else:
            x, y = min(int(a[i]), int(b[i])), max(int(a[i]), int(b[i]))
            if vt == 0:
                vt = 1
                kq1 = kq1 + str(x)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(y)
            else:
                kq1 = kq1 + str(y)
                kq2 = kq2 + str(x)
    print(kq1)
    print(kq2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 0, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is an empty string, b is an empty string, kq1 and kq2 are strings of digits from 1 to 9, vt is 1, i is equal to the length of the initial string a, kq1 is printed, and kq2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 1, stdin contains 2 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input, b is a string of input, i is equal to the length of the initial string a, kq1 and kq2 are strings containing the characters from a and b in an alternating pattern of minimum and maximum values, and vt is 1, and kq1 (a string containing the characters from a and b in an alternating pattern of minimum and maximum values) is being printed, and kq2 (a string containing the characters from a and b in an alternating pattern of minimum and maximum values) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 1000 (inclusive), q is 2, stdin contains 0 pairs of integers x and y, a is a string of input, b is a string of input, i is equal to the length of the initial string a, kq1 is a string containing the characters of a and b in an alternating pattern of minimum and maximum integer values, kq2 is a string containing the characters of a and b in an alternating pattern of maximum and minimum integer values, vt is 1, and kq1 and kq2 are not being printed, and kq2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
