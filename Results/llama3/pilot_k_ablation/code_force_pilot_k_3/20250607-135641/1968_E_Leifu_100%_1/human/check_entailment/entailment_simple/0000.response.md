Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program starts by printing the coordinates (1, 1) and (1, 2) for each test case. This is a valid starting point, as the Manhattan distance between these two points is 1, which is the smallest possible distance.

For n = 3, the program prints the coordinates (2, 3), which adds a new Manhattan distance of 2 to the set.

For n >= 4, the program prints the coordinates (2, 4) and then prints the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n (inclusive). This adds new Manhattan distances of 2, 3, ..., n-1 to the set.

The program's approach is correct because it starts with the smallest possible Manhattan distance (1) and then adds new distances in increasing order. By printing the coordinates (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n (inclusive), the program ensures that all possible Manhattan distances from 1 to n-1 are included in the set.

Therefore, the program correctly maximizes the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in the n x n grid.

Correctness: **True**
