Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes the number of test cases (t) and the value of n for each test case as input.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the optimal arrangement of cells to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is to place the cells in a specific pattern. The pattern starts with the cells at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then adds cells at positions (2, 3) if n is 3, or cells at positions (2, 4) and (j, j) for j ranging from 4 to n if n is 4 or greater.

The program correctly implements this logic by printing the cells in the specified pattern for each test case. The execution summary confirms that the program behaves as expected, printing the correct output for each test case.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
