Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 5, the program prints:

1 1
1 2
2 4
5 5

However, the correct output should be:

1 1
1 3
1 4
2 1
5 5

The program does not correctly handle the case when n is odd and greater than 3. It only prints the first two points correctly, but the remaining points are not correctly calculated.

The correct approach would be to calculate the points in a way that maximizes the Manhattan distance between them. One possible solution is to place the points in a zigzag pattern, starting from the top-left corner and moving down and right. This would ensure that the Manhattan distance between each pair of points is maximized.
