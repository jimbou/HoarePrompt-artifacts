Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent integer represents a value (n) for each test case.

For each test case, the program prints a series of numbers in a specific pattern. It always prints '1 1' and '1 2', and then either '2 3' if n is 3, or all numbers from 4 to n (inclusive) paired with themselves if n is 4 or greater.

The program's logic is based on the observation that the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances can be achieved by placing the cells in a specific pattern. For n = 2, the optimal arrangement is (1, 1) and (1, 2). For n = 3, the optimal arrangement is (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1). For n >= 4, the optimal arrangement is (1, 1), (1, 2), and all numbers from 4 to n (inclusive) paired with themselves.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
