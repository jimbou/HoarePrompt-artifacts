Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum number of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program provided attempts to solve this problem by printing a set of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the grid `n`.
3. It prints the points `(1, 1)` and `(1, 2)`, which is a valid starting point for any grid size.
4. If `n` is 3, it prints the point `(2, 3)`, which is a valid solution for a 3x3 grid.
5. If `n` is 4 or more, it prints the point `(2, 4)` and then prints points of the form `(j, j)` for `j` ranging from 4 to `n`. This is where the program goes wrong.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle grids of size 4 or more. The points printed by the program do not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. In fact, the program prints the same points for all grid sizes greater than or equal to 4, which is not correct.

For example, for a 5x5 grid, the program prints the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 2)`, `(2, 4)`, `(4, 4)`, and `(5, 5)`. However, this set of points does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. A correct solution for a 5x5 grid would be to print the points `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(1, 4)`, `(2, 1)`, and `(5, 5)`, which is not what the program prints.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
