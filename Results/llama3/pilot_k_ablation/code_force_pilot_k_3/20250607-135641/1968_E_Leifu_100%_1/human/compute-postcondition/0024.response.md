Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed, and `n` is not equal to 3, `j` is `n`, and this is printed: "`n` `n`"**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `j` will be equal to `n`, and the last printed statement will be the string representation of `n` followed by a space and then the string representation of `n` again. The values of `t`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
