Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer that was previously in stdin, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is printed, '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves, and '1 1' is printed, '1 2' is printed. Additionally, if `n` is not 3, the same output as the previous case is produced.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all `t` iterations, where `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The loop has processed all input integers `n` from stdin, and the output includes the results of all iterations. For each iteration, '1 1' and '1 2' are printed, and if `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves. The loop has finished executing, and the output state reflects the final results of all iterations.
