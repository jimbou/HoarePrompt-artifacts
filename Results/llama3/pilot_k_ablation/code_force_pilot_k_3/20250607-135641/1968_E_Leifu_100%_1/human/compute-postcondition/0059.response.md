To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, because the range starts from 4. If `n` is less than 4, the loop will not execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was previously in stdin and must be greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is printed, '1 2' is printed, `j` is 4**
