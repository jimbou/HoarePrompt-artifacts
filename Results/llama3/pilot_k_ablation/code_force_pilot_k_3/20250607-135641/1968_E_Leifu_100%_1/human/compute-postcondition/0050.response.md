Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was previously in stdin, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer that was previously in stdin. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The prints that were being printed before the code execution remain the same. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves.
