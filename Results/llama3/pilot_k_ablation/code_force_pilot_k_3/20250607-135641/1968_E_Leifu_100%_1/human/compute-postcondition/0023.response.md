Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed, and `n` is not equal to 3, `j` is `n`, and this is printed: `n` + ' ' + `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `j` is equal to `n`, and the last printed statement is `n` followed by a space and then `n` again. The values of `t`, `i`, and the input/output streams remain unchanged.
