The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and "`n` `n`" is being printed.**
