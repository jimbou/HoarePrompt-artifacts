Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was previously in stdin and must be greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is printed, '1 2' is printed, `j` is `n`, and all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 2 and 50, `i` remains 2, and `n` remains an integer that was previously input and is greater than or equal to 4. The standard input remains empty. The numbers '1 1' and '1 2' have been printed, followed by all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) printed with themselves. The loop variable `j` has reached the value of `n`.
