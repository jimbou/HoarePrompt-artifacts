According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 6, and `n` must be greater than 6.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 6, `j` is 6**
