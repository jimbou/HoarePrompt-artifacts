Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and "`n` `n`" is being printed, stdin contains no input, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is being printed, and all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, printing all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) with themselves. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the initial print statements are still present. The loop has completed its execution, and the final output state reflects the cumulative effect of all iterations.
