To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`. The objects involved are `j` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4, and `n` is an integer that must be greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 4, but since `n` is not changed by the loop, its state remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `t` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive)
* `i` remains 1
* `n` remains an integer that must be greater than 4
* `j` is now 5

The other states, such as the printed output, stdin, and the values of other variables, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 4, `j` is 5**
