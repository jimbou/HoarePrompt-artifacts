Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and "`n` `n`" is being printed, stdin contains no input.**

The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of `n` to an integer from the input. However, since the initial state specifies that stdin contains no input, this line of code will not change the value of `n`. The initial state already specifies the possible values of `n` and the corresponding print statements, so the output state remains the same.
