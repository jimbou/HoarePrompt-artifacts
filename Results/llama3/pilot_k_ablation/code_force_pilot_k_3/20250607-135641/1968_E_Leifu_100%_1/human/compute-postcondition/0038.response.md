The code prints the value of `j` twice, separated by a space. Based on the precondition, `j` is equal to `n`, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4. Since `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`. Therefore, the code prints the value of `n` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **4 4**
