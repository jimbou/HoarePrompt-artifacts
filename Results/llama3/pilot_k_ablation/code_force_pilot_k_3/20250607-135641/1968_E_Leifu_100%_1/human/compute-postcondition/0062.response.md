To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `j` and the expression `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5.

The value of `n` is not changed by the loop, so it remains an integer that was previously in stdin and must be greater than or equal to 4. However, since `j` is now 5, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t`, `i`, and the contents of stdin are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was previously in stdin and must be greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is printed, '1 2' is printed, `j` is 5**
