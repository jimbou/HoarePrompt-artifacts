To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5. Since `n` is not equal to 3, it can be any integer greater than or equal to 4, but for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 5.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 5, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed, and `j` is 5**
