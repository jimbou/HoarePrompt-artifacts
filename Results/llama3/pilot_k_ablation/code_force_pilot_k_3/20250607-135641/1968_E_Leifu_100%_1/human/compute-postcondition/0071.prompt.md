Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` inputs: integers `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3)
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print('1 1')
    print('1 2')
    if n == 3:
        print('2 3')
    elif n >= 4:
        print('2 4')
        for j in range(4, n + 1):
            print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and "`n` `n`" is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer. '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and "`n` `n`" is being printed, stdin contains no input, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was previously in stdin, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is printed, '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and all numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) are printed with themselves, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. Additionally, if `n` is not 3, the same output as the previous case is produced.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
