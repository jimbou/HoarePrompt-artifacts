Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent integer represents a value (n) for each test case. For each test case, the function prints a series of numbers in a specific pattern: it always prints '1 1' and '1 2', and then either '2 3' if n is 3, or all numbers from 4 to n (inclusive) paired with themselves if n is 4 or greater. The function repeats this process for each test case and does not return any value.**
