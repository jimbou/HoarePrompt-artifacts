According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make the loop execute, `i` must be 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0**
