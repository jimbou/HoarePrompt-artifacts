The code `t = int(input())` assigns the value of the first input integer to `t`. Since the stdin contains two inputs: first an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 50) and then `t` integers `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3), the value of `t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). The stdin now contains `t` integers `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3) as the first input has been consumed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` inputs: integers `n` (2 <= n <= 10^3)**
