To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, and `n` is greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 6. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 5, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 2, `n` is an integer that was previously in stdin and must be greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is printed, '1 2' is printed, `j` is 6**
