The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), i is 1, n is an integer, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed. If n is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If n is not equal to 3, and n is greater than or equal to 4, j is n, and "n n" is being printed, stdin contains no input, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is being printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 4 and j is now 4. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than 4, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is being printed. If `n` is not equal to 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `j` is `n`, and "`n` `n`" is being printed, stdin contains no input, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is being printed, j is 4**
