To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 4. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 4, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure it starts from 4.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains no input, '1 1' is being printed, and '1 2' is being printed, and `n` is not equal to 3, `j` is 4**
