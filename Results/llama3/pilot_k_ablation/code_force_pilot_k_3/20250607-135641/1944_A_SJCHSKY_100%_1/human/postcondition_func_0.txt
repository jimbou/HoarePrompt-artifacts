This function determines the minimum number of nodes in a graph that can have at least k edges. It takes two integers, n and k, as input and returns either 1 if k is greater than or equal to n-1, or the input n if k is less than n-1. The returned value represents the minimum number of nodes required to form a graph with at least k edges.
