Reasoning:

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The given program attempts to solve this problem by defining a function `func_1` that takes the number of islands `n` and the number of bridges that can be destroyed `k` as input.

The function `func_1` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If this condition is true, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, effectively isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, the function returns 1, indicating that Everule can only visit island 1.

If `k` is less than `n - 1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1. In this case, the function returns `n`, indicating that Everule can visit all islands.

The main part of the program reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `k` and calls the `func_1` function with these values as arguments. The result of the function call is then printed.

Based on the problem description and the provided example inputs and outputs, the given program appears to be correct. It correctly handles the cases where Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1 and where Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connected to island 1.

Correctness: **True**
