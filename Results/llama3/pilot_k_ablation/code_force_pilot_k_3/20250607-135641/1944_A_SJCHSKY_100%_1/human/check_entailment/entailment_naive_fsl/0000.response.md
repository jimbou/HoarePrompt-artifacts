Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

The function `func_1(n, k)` takes two parameters: `n`, the number of islands, and `k`, the maximum number of bridges that can be destroyed. It returns the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit.

The logic is as follows:

* If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connecting island 1 to other islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1, so the function returns 1.
* If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means that Dominater cannot destroy all bridges connecting island 1 to other islands. In this case, Everule can visit all islands, so the function returns `n`.

This logic is correct because if Dominater can destroy all bridges connecting island 1 to other islands, Everule can only visit island 1. Otherwise, Everule can visit all islands.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where `k` is 0 (no bridges are destroyed) and `k` is equal to `n-1` (all bridges connecting island 1 to other islands are destroyed).

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
