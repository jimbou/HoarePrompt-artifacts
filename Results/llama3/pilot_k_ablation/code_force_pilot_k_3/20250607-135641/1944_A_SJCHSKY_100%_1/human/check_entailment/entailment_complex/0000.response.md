Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally. The given program uses a function `func_1(n, k)` to determine this minimum number.

The function works as follows:

- If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means that Dominater can destroy all bridges connected to island 1, isolating it from the rest of the islands. In this case, Everule can only visit island 1, so the function returns 1.

- If `k` is less than `n-1`, it means that Dominater cannot isolate island 1 from the rest of the islands. In this case, Everule can visit all islands, so the function returns `n`.

The program's logic is correct because it correctly identifies the two possible scenarios:

1.  If `k` is sufficient to isolate island 1, Everule can only visit island 1.
2.  If `k` is not sufficient to isolate island 1, Everule can visit all islands.

The program's implementation is also correct, as it accurately represents these two scenarios using the conditional statement.

Correctness: **True**
