#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers, 1 <= n <= 100, 0 <= k <= n*(n-1)/2.
    if (k >= n - 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns 1
    else :
        return n
        #The program returns an integer n, where n is between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and n is greater than k + 1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines the minimum number of nodes in a graph that can have at least k edges. It takes two integers, n and k, as input and returns either 1 if k is greater than or equal to n-1, or the input n if k is less than n-1. The returned value represents the minimum number of nodes required to form a graph with at least k edges.
