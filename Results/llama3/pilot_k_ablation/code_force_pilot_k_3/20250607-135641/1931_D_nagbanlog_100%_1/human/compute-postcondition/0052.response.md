Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 cases, case is the third case in the list, results is a list with the first element being 0 and the second element being beautiful_count which is increased by the frequency of the current value of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) exists in freq, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least n elements, num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0 and freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1**
