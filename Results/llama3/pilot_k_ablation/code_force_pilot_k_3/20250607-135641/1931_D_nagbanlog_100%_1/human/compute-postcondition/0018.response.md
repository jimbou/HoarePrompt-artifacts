Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, `case` is the first case in the list, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, otherwise `beautiful_count` remains 0.**

The code increments the frequency of the pair `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary by 1. This means that the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` is now one more than its previous value. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
