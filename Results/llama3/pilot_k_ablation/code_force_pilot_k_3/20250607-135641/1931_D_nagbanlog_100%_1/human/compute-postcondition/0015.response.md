Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, case is the first case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0 and freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains 0.**

In this output state, the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` have been updated based on the new values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in `freq` has been increased by 1, and `beautiful_count` has been updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
