The only variable in the loop head is `num` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `a` is case['array'] does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` must have at least 1 element and `num` is the first element in the list `a`. 

State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, case is the first case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list a, freq is a dictionary with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0**
