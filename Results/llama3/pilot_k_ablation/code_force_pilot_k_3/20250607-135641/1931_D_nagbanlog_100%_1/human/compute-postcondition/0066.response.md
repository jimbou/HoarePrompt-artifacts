Functionality: **This function calculates the number of "beautiful" pairs in a list of integers for each test case. A pair is considered "beautiful" if the remainder of the first number divided by x is equal to the remainder of the second number divided by y, and the remainder of the second number divided by x is equal to the remainder of the first number divided by y. The function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of integers and two parameters x and y. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of beautiful pairs in the corresponding test case.**
