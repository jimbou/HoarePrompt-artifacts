Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 cases, case is the second case in the list, results is a list with the first element being 0, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 3 elements, num is the third element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0 and freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

The code modifies the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x`. The new values of `mod_x` and `mod_y` are the remainders of `num` divided by `x` and `y`, respectively. The new value of `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`. The value of `required_mod_y` is set to be equal to `mod_y`. The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary is increased by 1. If `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is in `freq`, the value of `beautiful_count` is updated by adding the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` to its previous value.
