Output State: **The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `beautiful_count` after processing the corresponding case in the `test_cases` list. Each `beautiful_count` value is calculated based on the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary, where `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. The `freq` dictionary is populated with the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs, where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The `num` value is the last element in the list `a`, which has at least `n` elements. The list `results` has `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer.**
