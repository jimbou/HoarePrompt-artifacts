Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, case is the first case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains 0, freq is a dictionary with default value 0.***
