Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, case is the first case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 1 element, num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, beautiful_count is 0, freq is a dictionary with default value 0**

In this output state, the variables mod_x, mod_y, and required_mod_x have been added, and their values are calculated based on the initial values of num, x, and y. The variable required_mod_y is equal to mod_y. All other variables remain unchanged.
