According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least 1 case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer and `results` is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the `test_cases` must have at least 1 case and the case is the first case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, `case` is the first case in the list, `results` is an empty list**
