The only object in the loop head is variable `case` and list `test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 cases, case is the second case in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 cases and the case is the third case in the list.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 cases, `case` is the third case in the list, `results` is a list with the first element being 0 and the second element being `beautiful_count`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the nth element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`.**
