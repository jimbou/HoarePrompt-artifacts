Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 cases, `case` is the third case in the list, `results` is a list with the first element being 0 and the second element being `beautiful_count` which is increased by the frequency of the current value of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the nth element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`, and for each element, it has calculated the remainder of the element divided by `x` and `y`, and updated the frequency of the corresponding pair in the `freq` dictionary. The `beautiful_count` has been updated by adding the frequency of the pair `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if it exists. The loop has finished executing, and the final state of the variables is as described above.
