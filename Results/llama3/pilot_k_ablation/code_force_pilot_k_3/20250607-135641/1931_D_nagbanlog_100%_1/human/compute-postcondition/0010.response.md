Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, case is the first case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0 and freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1, beautiful_count is increased by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq, otherwise beautiful_count remains 0.**

The code block modifies the values of `mod_x`, `mod_y`, and `required_mod_x` based on the values of `num`, `x`, and `y`. The `mod_x` is updated to be the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is updated to be the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The `required_mod_x` is calculated as the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is set to be equal to `mod_y`. The frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary is increased by 1, and the `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq`, or remains 0 if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` is not present in `freq`. All other variables remain unchanged.
