Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 1 case, case is the first case in the list, results is an empty list, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'], freq is a dictionary with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0**

The code block assigns values to several variables based on the initial state. The first line unpacks the values from `case['params']` into `n`, `x`, and `y`. The second line assigns the value of `case['array']` to `a`. The third line initializes a dictionary `freq` with a default value of 0, and the fourth line sets `beautiful_count` to 0. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, and `results` remain unchanged.
