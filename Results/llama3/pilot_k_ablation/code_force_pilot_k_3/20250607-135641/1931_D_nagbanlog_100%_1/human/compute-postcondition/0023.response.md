Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 cases, case is the second case in the list, results is a list with the first element being 0, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least n elements, num is the nth element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0.**

The code snippet resets the values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count`. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `case`, and `results` remain unchanged. The values of `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, and `required_mod_y` are no longer valid as they were dependent on the previous values of `n`, `x`, `y`, and `a`. The dictionary `freq` is reinitialized with a default value of 0, and `beautiful_count` is reset to 0.
