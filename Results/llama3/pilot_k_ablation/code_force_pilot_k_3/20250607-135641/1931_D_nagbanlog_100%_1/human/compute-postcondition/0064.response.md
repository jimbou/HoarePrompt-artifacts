Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, `case` is the last case in the list, `results` is a list with `t` elements, each element being the value of `beautiful_count` after processing the corresponding case, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has processed all the cases in the `test_cases` list, and the `results` list contains the `beautiful_count` value for each case. The loop variables `case`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `num`, `mod_x`, `mod_y`, `required_mod_x`, `required_mod_y`, `freq`, and `beautiful_count` have been updated to reflect the last case processed. The `t` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by the loop.
