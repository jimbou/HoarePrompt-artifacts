You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i.
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, x, y = case['params']
        
        a = case['array']
        
        freq = defaultdict(int)
        
        beautiful_count = 0
        
        for num in a:
            mod_x = num % x
            mod_y = num % y
            required_mod_x = (x - mod_x) % x
            required_mod_y = mod_y
            if (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq:
                beautiful_count += freq[required_mod_x, required_mod_y]
            freq[mod_x, mod_y] += 1
        
        results.append(beautiful_count)
        
    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, `case` is the last case in the list, `results` is a list with `t` elements, each element being the value of `beautiful_count` after processing the corresponding case, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `beautiful_count` after processing the corresponding case in the `test_cases` list. Each `beautiful_count` value is calculated based on the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary, where `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. The `freq` dictionary is populated with the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs, where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The `num` value is the last element in the list `a`, which has at least `n` elements. The list `results` has `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer.

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `beautiful_count` after processing the corresponding case in the `test_cases` list. Each `beautiful_count` value is calculated based on the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary, where `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. The `freq` dictionary is populated with the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs, where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The `num` value is the last element in the list `a`, which has at least `n` elements. The list `results` has `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
