Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 3 cases, case is the third case in the list, results is a list with the first element being 0 and the second element being beautiful_count, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least n elements, num is the first element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0, beautiful_count is 0**

The code snippet provided does not modify any variables that were not already defined in the initial state. The first line assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `x` to `mod_x`. The second line assigns the remainder of `num` divided by `y` to `mod_y`. The third line assigns the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x` to `required_mod_x`. The fourth line assigns `mod_y` to `required_mod_y`. No other variables are affected by the code.
