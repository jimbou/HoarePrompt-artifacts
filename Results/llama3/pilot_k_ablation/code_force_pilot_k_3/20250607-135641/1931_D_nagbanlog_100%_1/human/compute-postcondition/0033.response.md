Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists that must have at least 2 cases, case is the second case in the list, results is a list with the first element being 0, n is the first element of case['params'], x is the second element of case['params'], y is the third element of case['params'], a is case['array'] that must have at least 2 elements, num is the second element in the list a, mod_x is the remainder of num divided by x, mod_y is the remainder of num divided by y, required_mod_x is the remainder of x minus mod_x divided by x, required_mod_y is equal to mod_y, freq is a dictionary with default value 0 and freq[mod_x, mod_y] is increased by 1. If (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is in freq, then beautiful_count is the sum of its previous value and the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) in freq. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
