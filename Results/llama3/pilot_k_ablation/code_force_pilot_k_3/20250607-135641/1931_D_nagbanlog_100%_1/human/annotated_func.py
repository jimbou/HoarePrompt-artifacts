#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists, where each sublist contains three integers n, x, and y, followed by a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, such that 2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5, 1 <= x, y <= 10^9, and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all i.

    #State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists, `case` is the last case in the list, `results` is a list with `t` elements, each element being the value of `beautiful_count` after processing the corresponding case, `n` is the first element of `case['params']`, `x` is the second element of `case['params']`, `y` is the third element of `case['params']`, `a` is `case['array']` that must have at least `n` elements, `num` is the last element in the list `a`, `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`, `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`, `freq` is a dictionary with default value 0 and `freq[mod_x, mod_y]` is increased by 1, `beautiful_count` is increased by the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in `freq` if `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` exists in `freq`.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the value of `beautiful_count` after processing the corresponding case in the `test_cases` list. Each `beautiful_count` value is calculated based on the frequency of `(required_mod_x, required_mod_y)` in the `freq` dictionary, where `required_mod_x` is the remainder of `x` minus `mod_x` divided by `x`, and `required_mod_y` is equal to `mod_y`. The `freq` dictionary is populated with the frequency of `(mod_x, mod_y)` pairs, where `mod_x` is the remainder of `num` divided by `x`, and `mod_y` is the remainder of `num` divided by `y`. The `num` value is the last element in the list `a`, which has at least `n` elements. The list `results` has `t` elements, where `t` is a positive integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the number of "beautiful" pairs in a list of integers for each test case. A pair is considered "beautiful" if the remainder of the first number divided by x is equal to the remainder of the second number divided by y, and the remainder of the second number divided by x is equal to the remainder of the first number divided by y. The function takes a list of test cases as input, where each test case contains a list of integers and two parameters x and y. It returns a list of integers, where each integer represents the number of beautiful pairs in the corresponding test case.
