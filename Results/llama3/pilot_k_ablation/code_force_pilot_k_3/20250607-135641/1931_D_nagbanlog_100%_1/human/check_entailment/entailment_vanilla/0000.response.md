Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of beautiful pairs in an array. A beautiful pair is defined as a pair of indices (i, j) where a_i + a_j is divisible by x and a_i - a_j is divisible by y.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by reading the number of test cases (t) and storing the input parameters (n, x, y) and the array (a) for each test case in a list called `test_cases`.
2.  The function `func_1` is defined to process each test case. It initializes an empty list `results` to store the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.
3.  For each test case, it initializes a dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each pair of remainders (mod_x, mod_y) when the elements of the array are divided by x and y, respectively. The count of beautiful pairs is initialized to 0.
4.  The program then iterates over each element `num` in the array. For each element, it calculates the remainder when `num` is divided by x (mod_x) and the remainder when `num` is divided by y (mod_y).
5.  It then calculates the required remainder when `num` is divided by x (required_mod_x) such that the sum of `num` and the required number is divisible by x. The required remainder when `num` is divided by y (required_mod_y) is the same as mod_y.
6.  The program checks if the pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) is already present in the `freq` dictionary. If it is, it increments the count of beautiful pairs by the frequency of (required_mod_x, required_mod_y).
7.  Finally, it increments the frequency of (mod_x, mod_y) in the `freq` dictionary by 1.
8.  After processing all elements in the array, the program appends the count of beautiful pairs for the current test case to the `results` list.
9.  Once all test cases have been processed, the program prints the count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Based on the provided problem description and the given Python program, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array.

Correctness: **True**
