Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array as per the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program uses a defaultdict to store the frequency of each pair of remainders (mod_x, mod_y) for each number in the array. This is an efficient way to keep track of the frequency of each pair.

2. For each number in the array, the program calculates the required remainder (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) that would make a pair with the current number. It then checks if this required pair is already present in the frequency dictionary. If it is, it increments the beautiful_count by the frequency of the required pair.

3. The program correctly handles the case where the required remainder is the same as the current remainder (i.e., when the pair is (0, 0)). This is because the required remainder is calculated as (x - mod_x) % x, which correctly handles the case where mod_x is 0.

4. The program returns the total count of beautiful pairs for each test case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array, and it does so in an efficient manner.

Correctness: **True**
