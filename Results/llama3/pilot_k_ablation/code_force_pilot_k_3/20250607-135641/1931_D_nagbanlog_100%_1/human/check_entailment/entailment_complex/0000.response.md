Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of beautiful pairs in the array a for each test case. The program uses a dictionary to store the frequency of each pair of remainders (mod_x, mod_y) and then checks if the required pair (required_mod_x, required_mod_y) exists in the dictionary. If it does, it increments the beautiful_count by the frequency of the required pair. This is a correct and efficient approach to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
