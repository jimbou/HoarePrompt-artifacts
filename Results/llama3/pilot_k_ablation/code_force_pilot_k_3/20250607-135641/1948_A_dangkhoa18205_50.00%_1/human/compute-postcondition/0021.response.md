Output State: **n is an integer between -1 and 47 (inclusive), i is 2, res is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 4 times if n is between 2 and 46 (inclusive), 3 times if n is between 1 and 47 (inclusive), the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' if n is 48 or 49, or the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' if n is 49, followed by the character at index i % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, 'YES' has been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been decremented by 2, and the value of `res` has been extended by the character at index `i % 26` of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times. The value of `i` remains unchanged. The condition for printing 'YES' remains true.
