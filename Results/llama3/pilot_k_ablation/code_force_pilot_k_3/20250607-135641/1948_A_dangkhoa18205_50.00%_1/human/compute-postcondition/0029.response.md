Functionality: **This function reads an integer input from stdin between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and prints 'NO' if the input is less than or equal to 1. If the input is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' and generates a string 'res' based on the input value. The string 'res' is constructed by repeating characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' in a specific pattern, with the pattern depending on the input value. The function then prints the generated string 'res'.**
