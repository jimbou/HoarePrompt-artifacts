Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, and the function `func_1()` has been called with no input from stdin and has returned None.**

The code snippet is a function call to `func_1()` with no arguments. Since the function has already been called and returned None, the state of the program remains unchanged. The values of `t` and `_` are still the same, and the function call does not affect them. The output state is the same as the initial state.
