Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 0, res is an empty string, and 'YES' has been printed.
Code of the loop:
while n > 0:
    if n >= 2:
        res += letter[i % 26] * 2
        n -= 2
    else:
        res += letter[i % 26]
        n -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 1, 'YES' has been printed. If n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), res is 'AA'. If n is between 1 and 49 (inclusive), res is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed. If `n` is between 2 and 46 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 4 times. If `n` is between 1 and 47 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 3 times. If `n` is 48 or 49, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 50, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer between 1 and 49 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, 'YES' has been printed. If `n` is between 2 and 46 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 4 times if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is repeated 5 times. If `n` is between 1 and 47 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 3 times if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is repeated 4 times. If `n` is 48 or 49, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and then the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 49, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. In all cases, `res` is followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
