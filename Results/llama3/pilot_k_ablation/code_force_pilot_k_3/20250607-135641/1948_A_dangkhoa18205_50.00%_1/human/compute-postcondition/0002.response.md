Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, and a function `func_1()` has been called with no input from stdin.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not modify them. The function `func_1()` is called, but since there is no input from stdin, it does not affect the state of the variables. The function call is simply executed, and the program continues running.
