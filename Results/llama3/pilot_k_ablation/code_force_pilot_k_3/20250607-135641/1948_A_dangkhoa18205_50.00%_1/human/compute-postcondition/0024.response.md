Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 49 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3, 'YES' has been printed. If `n` is between 2 and 46 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 4 times if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is repeated 5 times. If `n` is between 1 and 47 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 3 times if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is repeated 4 times. If `n` is 48 or 49, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' and then the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 49, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise it is followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. In all cases, `res` is followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**

The value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `res` are still valid, but now `i` is 3, so the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' is the third character 'C'.
