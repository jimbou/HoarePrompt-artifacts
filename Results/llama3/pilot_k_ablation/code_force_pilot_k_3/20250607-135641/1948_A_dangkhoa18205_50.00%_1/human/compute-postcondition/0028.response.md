Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, where `res` contains the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times. If `n` is between 1 and 49 (inclusive), 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, where `res` contains the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, and then the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times. If `n` is 50, 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, where `res` contains the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times.***
