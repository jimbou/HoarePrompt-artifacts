The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so `i` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The initial state mentioned that 'YES' has been printed, so this condition is still valid. The initial state also mentioned that n is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), and letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. These conditions are still valid. The initial state also mentioned that If n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), res is 'AA'. If n is between 1 and 49 (inclusive), res is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. These conditions are still valid. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 1, 'YES' has been printed. If n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), res is 'AA'. If n is between 1 and 49 (inclusive), res is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.

Output State: **n is an integer between 0 and 50 (inclusive), letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 1, 'YES' has been printed. If n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), res is 'AA'. If n is between 1 and 49 (inclusive), res is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.**
