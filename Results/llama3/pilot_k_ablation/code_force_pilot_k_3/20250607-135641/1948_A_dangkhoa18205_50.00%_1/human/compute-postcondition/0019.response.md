Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50 (inclusive), `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed. If `n` is between 2 and 46 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 4 times. If `n` is between 1 and 47 (inclusive), `res` is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 3 times. If `n` is 48 or 49, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'. If `n` is 50, `res` is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
