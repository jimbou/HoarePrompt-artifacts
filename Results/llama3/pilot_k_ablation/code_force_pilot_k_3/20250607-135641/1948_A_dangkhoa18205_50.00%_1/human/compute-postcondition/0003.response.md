To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects involved are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0, and `t` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `_`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.

The state of `func_1()` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and a function `func_1()` has been called with no input from stdin.**
