Output State: **`_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_1()` has been called `t` times with no input from stdin and has returned None.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the variable `_` will have the value of `t-1`, and the function `func_1()` will have been called `t` times with no input from stdin, and will have returned None each time. The state of the other variables in the precondition, such as `t` being an integer greater than 0, remains unchanged.
