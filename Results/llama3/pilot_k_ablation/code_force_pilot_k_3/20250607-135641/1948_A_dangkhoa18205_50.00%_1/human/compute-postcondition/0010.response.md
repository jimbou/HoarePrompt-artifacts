The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the character at the index `i % 26` of the string `letter` twice to the string `res`. Since `i` is 0, the character at index 0 of `letter` is 'A', so `res` becomes 'AA'. The second line decrements `n` by 2.

Output State: **n is an integer between 0 and 48 (inclusive), letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 0, res is 'AA'**
