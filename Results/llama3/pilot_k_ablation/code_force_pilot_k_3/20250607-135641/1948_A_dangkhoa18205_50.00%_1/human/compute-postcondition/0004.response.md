Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, and the function `func_1()` has been called with no input from stdin and has returned None.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged, as the code snippet does not modify them. The function `func_1()` has been called with no input from stdin, and since it does not take any arguments, it does not affect the state of the program. The function call returns `None`, which is the default return value for functions in Python that do not explicitly return a value.
