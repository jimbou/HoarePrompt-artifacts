According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer greater than 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop variable `_` is not initialized. For the loop to execute, `_` must be initialized to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains no input**
