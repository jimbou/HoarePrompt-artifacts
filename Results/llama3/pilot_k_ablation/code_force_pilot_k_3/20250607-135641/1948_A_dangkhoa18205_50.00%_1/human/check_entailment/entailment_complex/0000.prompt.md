Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer n .

Your task is to build a string of uppercase Latin letters. There must be
exactly n special characters in this string. Let's call a character special if
it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

For example, there are 6 special characters in the AAABAACC string (at
positions: 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 ).

Print any suitable string or report that there is no such string.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 50 ) — the number of
test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 50 ).

Output

For each test case, print the answer as follows:

  * if there is no suitable string, print one line containing the string NO; 
  * otherwise, print two lines. The first line should contain the string YES; on the second line print a string of length at most 200  — the answer itself (it can be shown that if some answers exist, then there is an answer of length at most 200 ). If there are several solutions, print any of them. 

Example

Input

    3
    
    6
    
    1
    
    2

Output

    YES
    AAABAACC
    NO
    YES
    MM

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 50).
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: n is 0, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is between 1 and 25 (inclusive), 'YES' has been printed. If the initial value of n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), res is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, followed by the character at index i % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times. If the initial value of n is between 1 and 49 (inclusive), res is a string containing the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, followed by the character at index i % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, and then the character at index i % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times. If the initial value of n is 50, res is the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the character at index i % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: Error: res is not defined
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, where `res` contains the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times. If `n` is between 1 and 49 (inclusive), 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, where `res` contains the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times, and then the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times. If `n` is 50, 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, where `res` contains the first character of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' followed by the character at index `i` % 26 of 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' repeated 2 times.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads an integer input from stdin between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and prints 'NO' if the input is less than or equal to 1. If the input is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' and generates a string 'res' based on the input value. The string 'res' is constructed by repeating characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' in a specific pattern, with the pattern depending on the input value. The function then prints the generated string 'res'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State: `_` is `t-1`, and the function `func_1()` has been called `t` times with no input from stdin and has returned None.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads a positive integer from standard input, then calls another function (`func_1`) that number of times, passing no arguments and ignoring its return value, which is expected to be `None`.
