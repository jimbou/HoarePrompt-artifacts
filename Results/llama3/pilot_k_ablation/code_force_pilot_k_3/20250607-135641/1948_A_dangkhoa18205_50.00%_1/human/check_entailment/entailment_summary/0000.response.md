Reasoning: 

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads an integer input from stdin between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and prints 'NO' if the input is less than or equal to 1. If the input is greater than 1, it prints 'YES' and generates a string 'res' based on the input value. The string 'res' is constructed by repeating characters from 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' in a specific pattern, with the pattern depending on the input value. The function then prints the generated string 'res'.

`func_2` reads a positive integer from standard input, then calls `func_1` that number of times, passing no arguments and ignoring its return value, which is expected to be `None`.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. `func_1` correctly generates a string with exactly n special characters for inputs greater than 1, and `func_2` correctly calls `func_1` the specified number of times.

Correctness: **True**
