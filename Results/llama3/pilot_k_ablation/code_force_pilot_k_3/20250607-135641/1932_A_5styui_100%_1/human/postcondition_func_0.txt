This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of '@' characters in each string, ignoring any '*' characters that are followed by another '*'. The function prints the count of '@' characters for each test case and resets the count for the next test case.
