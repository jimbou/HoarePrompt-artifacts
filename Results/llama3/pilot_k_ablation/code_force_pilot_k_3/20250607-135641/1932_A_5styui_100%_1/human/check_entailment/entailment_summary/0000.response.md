Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly reads the input, counts the number of '@' characters in each string (ignoring any '*' characters that are followed by another '*'), and prints the count for each test case. The program also resets the count for each test case, which is necessary to avoid counting '@' characters from previous test cases.

However, the program does not handle the case where the input string contains a '*' character at the end, followed by no character (since it checks if the next character is '*'). But this is not a problem since the problem statement guarantees that the first cell is empty, and the program does not need to handle this case.

Correctness: **True**
