Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 and `j` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and no changes are made.***
