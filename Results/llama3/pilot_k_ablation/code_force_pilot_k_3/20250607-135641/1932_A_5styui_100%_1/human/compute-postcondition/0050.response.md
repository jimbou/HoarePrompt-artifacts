Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `s` is 0, the first character of `b` is not '@'. If `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, the current value of `b[j]` is the last character of `b`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `j` is not equal to `len(b) - 1`, and the next character in `b` (at index `j + 1`) is also '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
