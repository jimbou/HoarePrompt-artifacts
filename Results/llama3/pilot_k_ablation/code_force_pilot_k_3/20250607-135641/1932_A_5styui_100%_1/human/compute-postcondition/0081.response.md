Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, `s` is 0, the first character of `b` is not '@', and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The variable `a` remains greater than 2, `i` is still 2, `d` is still an integer equal to the input value, `b` is still a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `j` is still equal to the last index of `b`, `s` is still 0, the first character of `b` is still not '@', and the current character of `b` at index `j` is still '*'.
