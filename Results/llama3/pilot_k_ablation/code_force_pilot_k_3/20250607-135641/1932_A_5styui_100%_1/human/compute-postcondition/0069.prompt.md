Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is greater than 1, i is 1, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string equal to the input value, stdin contains t-3 test cases, j is equal to the length of the input string, s is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', then if it is the last character or followed by another '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `b` is '*', then if it is the last character or followed by another '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 if the second character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0. If the second character of `b` is '*', then if it is the last character or followed by another '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, and `j` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. If the third character of `b` is '@', `s` is increased by 1. If `j` is equal to the second last character of `b`, or if the third character of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
