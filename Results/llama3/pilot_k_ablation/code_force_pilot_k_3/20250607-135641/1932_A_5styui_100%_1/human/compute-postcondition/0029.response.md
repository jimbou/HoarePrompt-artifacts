Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is 2. If the third character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the third character of `b` is '*', or `j` is equal to the second last character of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
