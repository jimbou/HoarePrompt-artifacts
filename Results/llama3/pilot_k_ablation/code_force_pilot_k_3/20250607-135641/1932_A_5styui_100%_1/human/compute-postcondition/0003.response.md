To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`. The loop will execute if `b` has at least one character, because `range(len(b))` will be non-empty.

State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
