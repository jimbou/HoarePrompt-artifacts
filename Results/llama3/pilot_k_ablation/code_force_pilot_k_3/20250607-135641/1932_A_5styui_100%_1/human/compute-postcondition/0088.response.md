Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is not '@' and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*' and `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character of `b` at index `j+1` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
