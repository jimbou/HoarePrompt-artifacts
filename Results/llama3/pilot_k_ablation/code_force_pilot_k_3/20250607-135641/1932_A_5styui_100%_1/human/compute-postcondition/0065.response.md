Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 3 characters, `j` is 2. If the third character of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. In either case, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases.***
