To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `a` must be greater than 1.

State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is 0**
