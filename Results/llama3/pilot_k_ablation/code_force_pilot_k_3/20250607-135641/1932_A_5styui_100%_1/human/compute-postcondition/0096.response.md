Postcondition: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `b` is not '@' and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*' and `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character of `b` at index `j+1` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character of `b` at index `j` is '*', then the loop or if statement breaks, otherwise, no change occurs, `j` is 3.**
