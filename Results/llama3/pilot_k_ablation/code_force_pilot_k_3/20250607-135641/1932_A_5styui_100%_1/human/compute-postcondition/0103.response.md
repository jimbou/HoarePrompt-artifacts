Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 4 characters, `j` is 4, `s` is either 1 or 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise no change occurs. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b` or the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
