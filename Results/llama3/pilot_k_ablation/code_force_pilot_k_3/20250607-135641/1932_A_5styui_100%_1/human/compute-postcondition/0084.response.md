Output State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `j` is 0, `s` is 0, the first character of `b` is not '@', and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*', and `j` is not equal to `len(b) - 1`, and the character of `b` at index `j+1` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
