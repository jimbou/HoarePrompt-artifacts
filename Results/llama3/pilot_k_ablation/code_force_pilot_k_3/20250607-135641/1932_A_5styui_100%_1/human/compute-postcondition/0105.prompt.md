Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is greater than 2, i is 2, d is an integer equal to the input value, b is a string equal to the input value, stdin contains t-5 test cases, j is equal to the length of the input string, and s is 0
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is not '@' and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*' and `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character of `b` at index `j+1` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the first character of `b` is not '@' and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*' and `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character of `b` at index `j+1` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character of `b` at index `j` is '*', then the loop or if statement breaks, otherwise, no change occurs, `j` is 3.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 4 characters, `j` is 4. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b` or the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or 2 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise no change occurs and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
