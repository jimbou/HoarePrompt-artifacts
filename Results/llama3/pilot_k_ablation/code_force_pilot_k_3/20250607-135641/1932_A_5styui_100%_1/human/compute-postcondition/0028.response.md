Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is 2. If the third character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the third character of `b` is '*', or `j` is equal to the second last character of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The value of `s` is still dependent on the third character of `b` and the value of `j`. However, regardless of the previous conditions, we now break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
