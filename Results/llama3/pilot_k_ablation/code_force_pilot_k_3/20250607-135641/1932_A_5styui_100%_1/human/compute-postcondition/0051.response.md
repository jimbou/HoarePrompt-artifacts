Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, `s` is 0, and the first character of `b` is not '@'. If the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*', then if `j` is the last index of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is not the last index and the next character in `b` is also '*', the program also breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
