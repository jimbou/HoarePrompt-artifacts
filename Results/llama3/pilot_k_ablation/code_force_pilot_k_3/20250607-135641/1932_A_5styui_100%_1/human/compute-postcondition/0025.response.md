To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(len(b)):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `j` and `b`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the length of `b`. If `j` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The length of `b` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is 2. If the third character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the third character of `b` is '*', or `j` is equal to the second last character of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and no changes are made.**
