Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1. The current value of `j` is the last index of string `b`. The character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@'. The current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*'. stdin contains t-2 test cases. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
