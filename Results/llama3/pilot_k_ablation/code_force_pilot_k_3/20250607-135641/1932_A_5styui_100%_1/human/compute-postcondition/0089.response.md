The only object in the loop head is variable  j and string b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string b.  If the string b has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, string b has at least 1 character, j is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string b must have at least 3 characters and the j is 3.
State: **`a` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 3 characters, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is not '@' and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*' and `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character of `b` at index `j+1` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs, j is 3**
