Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1. The current value of `j` is the last index of string `b`. The character at index `j` of string `b` is not '@'. The current value of the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*'. stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
