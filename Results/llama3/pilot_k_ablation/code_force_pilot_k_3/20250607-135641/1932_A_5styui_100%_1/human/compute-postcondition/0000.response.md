Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters containing '.', '@', and '*' characters. a is an integer equal to the value of the first test case, s is 0.**

In this output state, the code has consumed the first test case from stdin, leaving t-1 test cases remaining. The variable 'a' has been assigned the value of the first test case, which is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50). The variable 's' has been initialized to 0. The rest of the test cases remain unchanged in stdin, each consisting of an integer n followed by a string of n characters containing '.', '@', and '*' characters.
