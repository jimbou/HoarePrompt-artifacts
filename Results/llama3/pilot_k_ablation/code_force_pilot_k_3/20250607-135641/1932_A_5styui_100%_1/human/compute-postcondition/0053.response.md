The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must be a string equal to the input value with at least 2 characters.
State: **`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', then if it is the last character or followed by another '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, j is 2**
