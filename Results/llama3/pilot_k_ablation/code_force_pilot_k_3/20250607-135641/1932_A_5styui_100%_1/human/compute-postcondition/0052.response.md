Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 1 character, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', then if it is the last character or followed by another '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
