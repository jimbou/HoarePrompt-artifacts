According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t-1 test cases and a is equal to the value of the first test case. So for the loop to be executed, a must be greater than 0 and i is now 0.

State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, a is greater than 0, i is 0, s is 0**
