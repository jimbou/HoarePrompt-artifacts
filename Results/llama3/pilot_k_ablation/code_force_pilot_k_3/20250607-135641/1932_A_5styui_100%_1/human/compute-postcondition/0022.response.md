Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is 1, `s` is 0. If `j` is equal to the second last character of `b`, or the second character of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
