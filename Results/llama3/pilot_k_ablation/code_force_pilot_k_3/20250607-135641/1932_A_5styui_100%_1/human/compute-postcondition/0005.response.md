The value of `s` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `s` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases. The current character at index `j` is still '@'. The index `j` is still 0. The string `b` still has at least 1 character. The integer `d` is still an integer. The variable `i` is still 0. The variable `a` is still greater than 0.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s` is 1, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character and the current character at index `j` is '@', `j` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**
