Postcondition: ***`a` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer equal to the input value, `b` is a string equal to the input value with at least 2 characters, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. `s` is 1 if the first character of `b` is '@', otherwise `s` is 0. If `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is not equal to the last index of `b`, then if the second character of `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made, and `j` is 2.***
