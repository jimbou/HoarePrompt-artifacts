Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is greater than 0, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer, b is a string, stdin contains t-2 test cases
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 and `j` is 0. If the character at index `j` of string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the character at index `j+1` of string `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is 1. If the second character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the second character of `b` is '*', or `j` is equal to the second last character of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `d` is an integer, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, stdin contains t-2 test cases, `j` is 2. If the third character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the third character of `b` is '*', or `j` is equal to the second last character of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `j` is equal to the last character of `b`, no changes are made. If the character at index `j + 1` of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the third character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
