This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It then counts the occurrences of each integer in the second line and determines the minimum number of operations required to make all counts less than k. If any count is greater than or equal to k, the minimum number of operations is k-1; otherwise, it is n. The function prints the minimum number of operations for each test case.
