Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first element `i` in the list `a` is a key in the dictionary `h` with a value greater than or equal to `k`, then `h` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary where the first element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value less than `k`.***
