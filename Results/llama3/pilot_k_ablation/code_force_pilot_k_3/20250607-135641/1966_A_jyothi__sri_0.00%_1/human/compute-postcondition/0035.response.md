Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is either incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `h`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, `ams` is `k-1`, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `ams` has been updated to `k-1`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `h` still contains `i` as a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, and the list `a` still has at least one integer. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
