Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 500) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h = {}
    ans = n
    for i in a:
        if i in h:
            h[i] += 1
        else:
            h[i] = 1
        if h[i] >= k:
            ams = k - 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `h` is a dictionary that contains all integers from the original list `a` as keys and their respective counts as values, `ans` is equal to `k-1` if any count in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the answer which is either `k-1` if any count in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `n` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the original list `a` and its corresponding value is the count of that integer in the original list `a`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If the count of any integer in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is `k-1`, otherwise `ams` is equal to `n`, and the value of `ans` which is equal to `n` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is an empty list, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `h` is a dictionary where each key is an element from the original list `a` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element, `ams` is equal to `k-1` if any element in `a` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ams` is not defined, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and the value of `ans` which is equal to `n` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
