Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is either incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `h`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, `ams` is `k-1`, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ams` has been updated to `k-1`, regardless of the previous value of `h[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
