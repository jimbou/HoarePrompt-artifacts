Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases. If the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is `k-1`, otherwise `ams` is equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `h[i]` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ams` is still dependent on the value of `h[i]` and `k`, but now `h[i]` has been incremented, so the condition for `ams` might have changed. If `h[i]` is now greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is `k-1`, otherwise it remains equal to `n`.
