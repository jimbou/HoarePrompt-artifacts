Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer as a key and the value of `h[first integer]` is increased by 1 if the first integer is already in `h`, otherwise the first integer is added to `h` with a value of 1, `h[i]` is increased by 1, `ans` is equal to `n` if `h[i]` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1, and the value of `ans` is updated based on the new value of `h[i]`. If `h[i]` is less than `k`, then `ans` remains equal to `n`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `k-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
