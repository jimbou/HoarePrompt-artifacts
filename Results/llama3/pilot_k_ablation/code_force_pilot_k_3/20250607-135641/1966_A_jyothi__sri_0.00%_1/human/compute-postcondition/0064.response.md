Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the second element `i` in the list `a` is a key in the dictionary `h` with a value greater than or equal to `k`, then `h` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k+1`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary where the second element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value less than `k` incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `_` remains the same. The list `a` still contains at least 2 integers from the second input. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases. The dictionary `h` has been updated such that the value of the second element `i` in the list `a` has been incremented by 1. If the value of `i` in `h` was greater than or equal to `k`, then its value is now greater than or equal to `k+1`. Otherwise, its value is still less than `k` but has been incremented by 1. The value of `ams` remains equal to `k-1`.
