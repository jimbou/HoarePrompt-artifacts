Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the third element `i` in the list `a` is a key in the dictionary `h`, then `h` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary where the third element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value of 1.**
