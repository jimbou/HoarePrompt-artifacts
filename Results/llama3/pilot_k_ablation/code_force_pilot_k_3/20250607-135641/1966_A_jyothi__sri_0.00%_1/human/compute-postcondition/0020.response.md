Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer as a key and the value of `h[first integer]` is increased by 1 if the first integer is already in `h`, otherwise the first integer is added to `h` with a value of 1. If `i` is already in `h`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, then `h` now also contains `i` as a key with a value of 1. `ans` is equal to `n` if the value of `h[first integer]` or `h[i]` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`.**
