According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `a` is a list of integers, so it needs to be adjusted to `a` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
