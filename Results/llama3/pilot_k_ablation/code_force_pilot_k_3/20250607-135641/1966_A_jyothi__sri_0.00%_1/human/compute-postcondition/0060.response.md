Postcondition: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first element `i` in the list `a` is already a key in the dictionary `h`, then its value in `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added to `h` as a key with a value of 1. The current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
