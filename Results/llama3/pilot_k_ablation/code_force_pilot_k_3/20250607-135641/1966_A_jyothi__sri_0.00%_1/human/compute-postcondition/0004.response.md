The value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `h[i]` was not specified, but it is known that `i` is a key in the dictionary `h`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**
