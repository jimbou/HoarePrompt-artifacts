To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are variable `i` and list `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute.

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `a` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is now the first integer in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**
