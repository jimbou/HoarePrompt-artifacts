Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `h` is a dictionary where the third element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value incremented by 1 if `i` is already a key in `h`, otherwise `i` is a key with a value of 1, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes as described above. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.***
