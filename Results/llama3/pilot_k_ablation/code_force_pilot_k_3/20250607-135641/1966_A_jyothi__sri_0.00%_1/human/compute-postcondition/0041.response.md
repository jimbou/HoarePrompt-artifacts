Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is either incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `h`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, `ams` is `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `h`, `ans`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variable `ams` is assigned the value `k-1`. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.
