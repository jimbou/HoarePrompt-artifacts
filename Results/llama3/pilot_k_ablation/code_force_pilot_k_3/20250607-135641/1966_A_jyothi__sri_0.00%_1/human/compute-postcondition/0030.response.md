The value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, and `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-3 test cases.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
