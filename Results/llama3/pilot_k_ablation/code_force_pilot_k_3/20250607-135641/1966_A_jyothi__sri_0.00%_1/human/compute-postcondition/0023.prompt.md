Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, h is an empty dictionary, ans is equal to n, _ is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1 if `i` is already in `h`, otherwise `i` is added to `h` with a value of 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If the value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer as a key and the value of `h[first integer]` is increased by 1 if the first integer is already in `h`, otherwise the first integer is added to `h` with a value of 1. If `i` is already in `h`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, then `h` now also contains `i` as a key with a value of 1. `ans` is equal to `n` if the value of `h[first integer]` or `h[i]` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer as a key and the value of `h[first integer]` is increased by 1 if the first integer is already in `h`, otherwise the first integer is added to `h` with a value of 1. If `i` is already in `h`, then `h[i]` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, then `h` now also contains `i` as a key with a value of 1. `ans` is equal to `n` if the value of `h[first integer]` or `h[i]` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
