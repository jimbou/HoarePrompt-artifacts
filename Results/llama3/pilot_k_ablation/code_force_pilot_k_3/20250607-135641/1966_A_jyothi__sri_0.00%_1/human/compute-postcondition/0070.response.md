Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `h` is a dictionary where the third element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value incremented by 1, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, `_`, and `ams` remain the same as in the initial state. The dictionary `h` is updated such that the value of the third element `i` in the list `a` is incremented by 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains `t-5`.
