Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `h` is a dictionary that contains all integers from the original list `a` as keys and their respective counts as values, `ans` is equal to `k-1` if any count in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, and the answer which is either `k-1` if any count in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `n` is being printed**
