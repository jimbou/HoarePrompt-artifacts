Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, a is a list of integers from the second input, h is an empty dictionary, ans is equal to n, _ is 2, stdin contains t-5 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the first element `i` in the list `a` is a key in the dictionary `h` with a value greater than or equal to `k`, then `h` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary where the first element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the second element `i` in the list `a` is a key in the dictionary `h` with a value greater than or equal to `k`, then `h` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k+1`. Otherwise, if `i` is a key in `h`, `h` is a dictionary where the second element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value less than `k` incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in `h`, `h` is a dictionary where the second element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value of 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `h` is a dictionary where the third element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value incremented by 1 if `i` is already a key in `h`, otherwise `i` is a key with a value of 1, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the program executes as described above. Otherwise, the program does not execute any additional operations.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
