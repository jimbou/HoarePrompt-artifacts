Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, `ams` is equal to `n` because `h[i]` is less than `k`, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `h[i]` has been updated to 1, and since `h[i]` is less than `k`, the value of `ams` is equal to `n`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
