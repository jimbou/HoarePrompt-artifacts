Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary that contains `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is either incremented by 1 if `i` was already in `h`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `h`, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases. The current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**
