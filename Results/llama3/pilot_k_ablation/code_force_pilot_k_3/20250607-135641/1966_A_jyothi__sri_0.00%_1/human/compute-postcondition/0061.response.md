Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 2, `h` is a dictionary where the first element `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, `_`, and `h` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `ams` is introduced and assigned the value of `k-1`. The stdin still contains `t-5` test cases.
