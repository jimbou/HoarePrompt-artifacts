Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` as a key and the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1 if `i` is already in `h`, otherwise `i` is added to `h` with a value of 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `_` is 0, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for the new variable `ams` which is assigned the value of `k-1`. The value of `ams` is now equal to `k-1`, and all other variables retain their original values and properties.
