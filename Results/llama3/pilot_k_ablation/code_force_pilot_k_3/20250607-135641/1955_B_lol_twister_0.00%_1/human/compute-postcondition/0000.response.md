Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers, each integer in `l` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been sorted in ascending order, while the values of `n`, `c`, and `d` remain unchanged. The length of the list `l` is still `n^2`, and each integer in the list is still within the range of 1 to 10^9.
