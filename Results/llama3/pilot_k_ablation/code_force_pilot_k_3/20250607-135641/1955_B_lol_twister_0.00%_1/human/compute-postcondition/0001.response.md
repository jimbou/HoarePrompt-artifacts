Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `c` and `d` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers, each integer in `l` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9. The current value of the difference between the last and first elements of `l` is not equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`***
