The only variable in the loop head is variable  k and r, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `r`. If `k` is less than `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 0, `r` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1, so `k` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `r` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `c` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `d` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `l` is a sorted list of n^2 integers, each integer in l is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of l, `r` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is 1, and the first element of `l` is equal to the last element of `l`**
