Postcondition: ***`n`, `c`, `d`, `r` are integers greater than 1, `l` is a sorted list of `n^2` integers, each integer in `l` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `a` is an integer equal to the sum of the first and last elements of `l`, `k` is 1. If the kth element of `l` is not equal to the (-k)th element from the end of `l`, the program returns the string 'no'. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
