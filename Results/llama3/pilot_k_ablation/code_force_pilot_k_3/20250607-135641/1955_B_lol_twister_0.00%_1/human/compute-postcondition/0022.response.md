Functionality: **This function checks if a given list of integers can be arranged in a specific pattern. It takes as input a list `l` of `n^2` integers, where `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and two integers `c` and `d` greater than or equal to 1. The function first sorts the list `l` and then checks if the difference between the last and first elements of the sorted list is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. If not, it returns 'no'. If `n` is odd, it further checks if the middle element of the sorted list is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements. If not, it returns 'NO'. Finally, it checks if the first half of the sorted list is a mirror image of the second half. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be arranged in the desired pattern. If any of the checks fail, it returns 'no' or 'NO', indicating that the list cannot be arranged in the desired pattern.**
