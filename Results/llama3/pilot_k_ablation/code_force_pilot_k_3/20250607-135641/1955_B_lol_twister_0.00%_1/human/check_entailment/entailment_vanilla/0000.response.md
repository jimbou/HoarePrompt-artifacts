Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a given array of integers can be rearranged into a progressive square of size n, with parameters c and d. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case.

2. For each test case, it reads the size of the square (n), and the values of c and d. It also reads an array of n^2 integers.

3. The program then calls the function func_1 with the given parameters.

4. Inside func_1, the array is sorted in ascending order.

5. The program checks if the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array is equal to (n - 1) * (c + d). If not, it returns 'no'.

6. If the array passes the previous check, the program calculates the sum of the smallest and largest elements (a).

7. It then calculates the middle index of the array (r).

8. If the size of the square (n) is odd, the program checks if the middle element of the array is equal to half of the sum calculated in step 6. If not, it returns 'NO'.

9. The program then checks if the array is symmetric around the middle index. If not, it returns 'no'.

10. If the array passes all the previous checks, the program returns 'yes'.

The program's logic is correct, and it accurately checks if the given array can be rearranged into a progressive square with the given parameters. However, there is a small issue with the return values. The program returns 'no' and 'NO' which are not consistent. It should return either 'no' or 'NO' consistently. But this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **True**
