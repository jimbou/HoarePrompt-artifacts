Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to check if a given list of integers can be arranged in a progressive square pattern. The program first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between the last and first elements is equal to `(n - 1) * (c + d)`. If `n` is odd, it further checks if the middle element is equal to half of the sum of the first and last elements. Finally, it checks if the first half of the sorted list is a mirror image of the second half. If all checks pass, it returns 'yes', indicating that the list can be arranged in the desired pattern. If any of the checks fail, it returns 'no' or 'NO', indicating that the list cannot be arranged in the desired pattern.

The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is odd or even, and it correctly checks for the mirror image property of the first and second halves of the sorted list. The program also correctly returns 'no' or 'NO' if any of the checks fail, indicating that the list cannot be arranged in the desired pattern.

Correctness: **True**
