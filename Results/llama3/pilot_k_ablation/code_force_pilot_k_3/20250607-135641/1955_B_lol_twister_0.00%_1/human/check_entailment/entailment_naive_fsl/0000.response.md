Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input:

3 2 3
3 9 6 5 7 1 10 4 8

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because the progressive square can be constructed from the array elements.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array is equal to (n-1)*(c+d), and if the middle element is equal to the average of the maximum and minimum elements. However, it does not check if the array elements can be arranged in a progressive square according to the rules.

For instance, in the above example, the array elements can be arranged in a progressive square as follows:

3 9 6
5 7 1
10 4 8

This arrangement satisfies all the rules of a progressive square, but the program does not detect it.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
