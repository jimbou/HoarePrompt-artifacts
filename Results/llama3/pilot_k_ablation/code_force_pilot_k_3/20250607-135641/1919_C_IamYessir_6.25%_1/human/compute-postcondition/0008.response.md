The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. If the current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, `b` is an empty list.**
