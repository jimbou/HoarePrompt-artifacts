Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 3 or 2. Otherwise, `s` is 1.***
