To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, len(a)):`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list containing at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 3 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 2 or 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
