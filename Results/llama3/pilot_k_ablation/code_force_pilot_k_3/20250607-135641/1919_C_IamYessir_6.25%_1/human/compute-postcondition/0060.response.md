To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `a` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers**
