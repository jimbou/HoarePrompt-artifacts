Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `len(a)-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all elements in list `a`, and the value of `s` is the total number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element. The other variables remain unchanged.
