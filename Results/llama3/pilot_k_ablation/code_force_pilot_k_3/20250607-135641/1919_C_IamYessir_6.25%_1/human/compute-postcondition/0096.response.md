The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.**
