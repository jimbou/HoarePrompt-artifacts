Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus one, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1` has increased by one. All other variables remain unchanged.
