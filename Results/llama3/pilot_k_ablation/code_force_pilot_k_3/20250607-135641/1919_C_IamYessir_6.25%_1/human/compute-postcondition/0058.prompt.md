Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, i is not defined, s is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. If the last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. If the last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
