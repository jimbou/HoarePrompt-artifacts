Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` and must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus one. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. The list `b` still contains all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` and must have at least 2 elements. The current value of `b[i]` is still greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.
