Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. If the current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `b` now contains an additional element, which is the element at index `i` in the list `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged.
