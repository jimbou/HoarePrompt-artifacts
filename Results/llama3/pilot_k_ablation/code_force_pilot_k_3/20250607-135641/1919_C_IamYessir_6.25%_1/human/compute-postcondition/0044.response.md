To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, because the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.

Since `i` is not defined before the loop, we can define it as 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

The other variables `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `b`, and `s` are not in the loop head, so we cannot adjust their states. However, we can note that `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, which implies that there are at least 2 test cases left to process.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers**
