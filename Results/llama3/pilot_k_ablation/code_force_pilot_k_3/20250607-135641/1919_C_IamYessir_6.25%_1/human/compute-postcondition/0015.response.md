Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. If the current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, the element at index `i` in `lit`, and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`.***
