Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit`, `s` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. The last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `b` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` in `lit`. The other variables remain unchanged. The last element of `a` is still less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, which is now the only element in `b`.
