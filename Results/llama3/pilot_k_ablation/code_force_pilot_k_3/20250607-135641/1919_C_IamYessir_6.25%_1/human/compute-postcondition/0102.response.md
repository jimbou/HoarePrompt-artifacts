To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least 2 elements. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be 1 (the starting value of the range). Additionally, `a` should have at least 2 elements.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
