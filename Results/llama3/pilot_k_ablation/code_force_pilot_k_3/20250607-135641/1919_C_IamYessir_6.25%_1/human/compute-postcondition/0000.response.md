According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value returned by `int(input())` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed, the value returned by `int(input())` must be at least 1 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `_` is 0, `int(input())` must be at least 1**
