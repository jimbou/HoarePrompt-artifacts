Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` in `lit`, which is the third element of `lit` since `i` is 2. The value of `b` remains an empty list. The other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
