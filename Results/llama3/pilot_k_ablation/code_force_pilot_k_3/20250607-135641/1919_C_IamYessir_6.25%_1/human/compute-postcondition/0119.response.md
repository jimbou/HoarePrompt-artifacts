Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 3 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.***
