Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit` that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, plus 1 if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. This means that the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, plus 1 if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, has increased by 1.
