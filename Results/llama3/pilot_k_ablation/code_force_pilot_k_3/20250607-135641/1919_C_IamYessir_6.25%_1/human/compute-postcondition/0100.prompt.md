Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, i is undefined, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, a is a list containing the first element of lit, b is an empty list, s is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers, and the number of pairs of consecutive elements in a and b where the second element is greater than the first, which is s, is not being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit` and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list. In either case, `a` has an additional element at index `i` in `lit` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
