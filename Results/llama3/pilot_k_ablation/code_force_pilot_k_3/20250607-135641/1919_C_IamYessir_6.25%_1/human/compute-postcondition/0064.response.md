The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` contains at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must contain at least 3 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is 1 if the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**
