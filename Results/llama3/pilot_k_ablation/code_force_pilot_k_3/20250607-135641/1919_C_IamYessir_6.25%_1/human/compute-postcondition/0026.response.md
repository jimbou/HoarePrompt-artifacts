Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `s` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `s` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
