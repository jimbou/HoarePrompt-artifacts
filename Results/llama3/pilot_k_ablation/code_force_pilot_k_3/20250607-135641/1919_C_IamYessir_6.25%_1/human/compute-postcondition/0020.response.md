Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`, `s` is 1. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains at least 2 integers, and the current value of `a[i]` is still greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`. The input stream `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
