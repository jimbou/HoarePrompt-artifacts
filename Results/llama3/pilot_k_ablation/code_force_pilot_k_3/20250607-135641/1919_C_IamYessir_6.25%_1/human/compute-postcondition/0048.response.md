The code `a.append(lit[i])` appends the element at index `i` in `lit` to the end of list `a`. The value of `i` is 1. The value of `lit` is a list of integers. The value of `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`. The last element of `a` is not less than the element at index `i` in `lit`. 

The value of `n` is at least 2. The value of `cp` is 0. The value of `b` is an empty list. The value of `s` is not defined. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**
