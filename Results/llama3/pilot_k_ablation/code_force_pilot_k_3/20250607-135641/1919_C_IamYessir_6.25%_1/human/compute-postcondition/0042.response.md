To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which implies that there is at least one more test case to process. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly mentioned in the state, but we can infer that it is used to iterate over the range of `n`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. `n` must be greater than 0, since we need at least one more test case to process.
2. The loop variable `_` is not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume it will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Based on these considerations, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `len(b)-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`. `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus the number of elements in `b` that are greater than the previous element**

Note that we did not adjust the values of `i`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `b`, or `s`, as they are not directly related to the loop head and do not affect the execution of the next iteration.
