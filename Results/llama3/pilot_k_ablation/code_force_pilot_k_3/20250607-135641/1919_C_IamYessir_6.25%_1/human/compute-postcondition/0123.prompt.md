Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 2 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 3 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 4 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`, plus one more increment. Otherwise, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
