Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`. `s` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The initial value of `s` was either 0 or 1, depending on whether `a[i]` was greater than `a[i - 1]`. After the increment, `s` is now either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
