Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list. In either case, `a` has an additional element at index `i` in `lit` appended to it.***
