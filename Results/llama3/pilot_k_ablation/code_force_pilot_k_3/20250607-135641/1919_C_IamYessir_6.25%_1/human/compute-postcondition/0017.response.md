Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`, `s` is 0.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, and a new variable `s` is introduced and assigned the value 0. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers.
