The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit` that must have at least 3 elements, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, plus 1 if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**
