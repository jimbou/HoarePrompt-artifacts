Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 3 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. The list `b` still contains at least 3 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`. The value of `s` now represents the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`, plus 1.
