To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The state of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables `n`, `lit`, `cp`, `b`, `s`, and `stdin` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` remains 0.**
