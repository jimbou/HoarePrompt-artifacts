According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer at least 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**
