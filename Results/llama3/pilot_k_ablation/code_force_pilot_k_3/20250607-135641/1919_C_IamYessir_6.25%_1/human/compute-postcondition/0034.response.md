Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` and must have at least 3 elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus two. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus one.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is now the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus two. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus one. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
