Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 4 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is 3 if the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is now 3, otherwise `s` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
