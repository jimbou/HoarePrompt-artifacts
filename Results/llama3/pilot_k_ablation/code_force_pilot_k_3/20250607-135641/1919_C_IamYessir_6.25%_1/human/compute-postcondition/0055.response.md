Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` or `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. If the last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list but now it contains the integer at index `i` in `lit`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, `i` is still 3, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, `s` is still not defined. The list `b` now contains the integer at index `i` in `lit`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. If the last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list but now it contains the integer at index `i` in `lit`.
