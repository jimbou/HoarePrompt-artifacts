The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than `len(b) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `b` is a list containing at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 4 elements.
State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing at least 4 elements of all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `a[i]` is greater than the value of `a[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(a) - 1`. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `n`, `i`, `lit`, `cp`, `a`, `b`, and `s` remain unchanged.**
