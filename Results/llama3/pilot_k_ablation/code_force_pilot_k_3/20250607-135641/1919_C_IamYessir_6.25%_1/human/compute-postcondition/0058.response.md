Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, and `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate `n-1` times, and after each iteration, it will compare the last element of list `a` with the current element in list `lit`. If the last element of `a` is less than the current element in `lit`, the current element will be appended to list `b`. Otherwise, the current element will be appended to list `a`. 

After the loop finishes executing, list `a` will contain the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, and list `b` will contain the remaining integers from `lit`. If all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, list `a` will contain the first `n` integers from `lit`. 

The values of `n`, `cp`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
