Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is 2 if the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, otherwise `s` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.***
