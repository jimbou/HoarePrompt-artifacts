Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit` that must have at least 2 elements, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `b[i]` is greater than the current value of `b[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, indicating that there is one more pair of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first. All other variables remain unchanged.
