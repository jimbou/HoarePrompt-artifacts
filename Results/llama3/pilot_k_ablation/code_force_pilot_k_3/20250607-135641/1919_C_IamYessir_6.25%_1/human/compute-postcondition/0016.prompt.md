Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer at least 1, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if a[-1] < lit[i]:
        b.append(lit[i])
    else:
        a.append(lit[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. If the current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, `b` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. If the current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. If the current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, the element at index `i` in `lit`, and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
