Postcondition: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. The last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`.**
