Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    lit = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a, b = [lit[0]], []
    cp = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if a[-1] < lit[i]:
            b.append(lit[i])
        else:
            a.append(lit[i])
    s = 0
    for i in range(1, len(a)):
        if a[i] > a[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    for i in range(1, len(b)):
        if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
            s += 1
    print(s)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `len(b)-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`. `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus the number of elements in `b` that are greater than the previous element, and the value of `s` which is the sum of the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus the number of elements in `b` that are greater than the previous element is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers, and the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` and `b` where the second element is greater than the first, which is `s`, is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of times the value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(b) - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the number of times the value of `b[i]` is greater than the value of `b[i - 1]` for `i` in range 1 to `len(b) - 1` which is `s` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
