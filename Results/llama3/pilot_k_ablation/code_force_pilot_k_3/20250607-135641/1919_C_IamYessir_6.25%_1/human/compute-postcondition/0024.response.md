Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing at least 3 integers, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`. If the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`, then `s` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, no change is made to `s`.***
