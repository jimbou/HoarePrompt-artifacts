Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `len(a)-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, len(b)):
    if b[i] > b[i - 1]:
        s += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` and must have at least 2 elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus one. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` and must have at least 3 elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus two. Otherwise, `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` and must have at least 4 elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus three. Otherwise, `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus two.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
