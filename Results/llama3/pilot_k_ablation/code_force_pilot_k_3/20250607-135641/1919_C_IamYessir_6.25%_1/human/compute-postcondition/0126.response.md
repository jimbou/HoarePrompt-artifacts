Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit` and all elements of `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first, stdin contains no test cases, and the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` and `b` where the second element is greater than the first, which is `s`, is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input `n` is an integer, the index `i` is at the last element of list `b`, the list `lit` contains integers, the counter `cp` is 0, list `a` contains the first element of `lit` and all elements that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, list `b` contains all elements of `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`, the sum `s` is the total number of pairs of consecutive elements in both `a` and `b` where the second element is greater than the first, and there are no more test cases in the input. The final value of `s` is being printed as the output.
