Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. If the current value of the last element of `a` is less than the current value of the element at index `i` in `lit`, `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, the element at index `i` in `lit`, and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit`, the element at index `i` in `lit`, and the element at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated by appending the element at index `i` in `lit` to its existing list. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `a` and `b` still depends on the comparison between the last element of `a` and the element at index `i` in `lit`.
