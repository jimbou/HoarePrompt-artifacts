The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `b`. If `i` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `b` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a` and must have at least 3 elements. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element plus one. Otherwise, `s` remains the number of elements in `a` that are greater than the previous element.**
