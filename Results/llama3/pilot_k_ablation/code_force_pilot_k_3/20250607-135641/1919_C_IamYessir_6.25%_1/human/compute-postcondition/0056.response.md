Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit` if the last element of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, otherwise `a` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is an empty list if the last element of `a` is not less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, `i` is still 3, `lit` is still a list of integers, and `cp` is still 0. The list `a` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` in `lit`. If the last element of `a` was not less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, then `a` now contains the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` now contains the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`. The list `b` is empty if the last element of `a` was not less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, otherwise it contains the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`. The variable `s` is still not defined, and there are still multiple test cases minus 2 inputs in stdin.
