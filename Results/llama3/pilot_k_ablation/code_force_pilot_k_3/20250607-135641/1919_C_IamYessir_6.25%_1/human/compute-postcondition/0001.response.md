Output State: **n is an integer at least 1, lit is a list of integers, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, cp is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers**

In this output state, the value of `n` is an integer at least 1, which is obtained from the first line of the code. The value of `lit` is a list of integers, which is obtained from the second line of the code. The value of `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit`, which is obtained from the third line of the code. The value of `b` is an empty list, which is also obtained from the third line of the code. The value of `cp` is 0, which is obtained from the fourth line of the code. The value of stdin is multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers, which is obtained from the first and second lines of the code.
