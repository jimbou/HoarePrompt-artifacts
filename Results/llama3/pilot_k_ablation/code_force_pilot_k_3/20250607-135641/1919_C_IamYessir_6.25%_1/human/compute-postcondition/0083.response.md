Output: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `len(b) - 1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, plus the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `b` where the second element is greater than the first, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers, and the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` and `b` where the second element is greater than the first, which is `s`, is being printed**
