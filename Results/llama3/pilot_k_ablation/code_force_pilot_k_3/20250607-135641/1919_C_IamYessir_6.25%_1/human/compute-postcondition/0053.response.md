Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. If the last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, then `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`. Otherwise, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, and `b` is an empty list.***
