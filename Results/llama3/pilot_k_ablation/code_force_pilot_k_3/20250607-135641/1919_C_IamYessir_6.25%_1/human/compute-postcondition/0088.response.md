Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit`, `s` is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The last element of `a` is less than the element at index `i` in `lit` which is now the last element of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to include the element at index `i` in `lit`, which is the second element of `lit` since `i` is 1. The last element of `a` is still less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, but now this element is also the last element of `b`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
