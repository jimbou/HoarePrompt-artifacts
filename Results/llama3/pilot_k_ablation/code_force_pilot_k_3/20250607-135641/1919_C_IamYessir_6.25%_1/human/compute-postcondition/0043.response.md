Output State: **n is an integer, lit is a list of integers, cp is 0, a is a list containing the first integer from lit, b is an empty list, i is not defined, s is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**

The code snippet provided modifies the initial state in the following ways:

- The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1.
- The second line reads a space-separated list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `lit`. This reduces the number of inputs in stdin by 1.
- The third line initializes `a` with the first integer from `lit` and initializes `b` as an empty list. 
- The fourth line sets `cp` to 0.

The variables `i` and `s` are not defined in the given code snippet, so their values are not modified. The variable `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.
