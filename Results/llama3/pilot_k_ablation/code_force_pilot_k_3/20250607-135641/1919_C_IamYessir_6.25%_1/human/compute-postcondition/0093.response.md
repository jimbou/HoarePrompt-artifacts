Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 2, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is undefined, `b` is a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` or `b` is an empty list and `a` is a list containing the first two elements of `lit` if the last element of `a` is not less than the element at index `i` in `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, `i` is still 2, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, and `s` is still undefined. The list `b` now contains the element at index `i` (which is 2) in `lit`. The value of `a` is still a list containing the first two elements of `lit` if the last element of `a` is not less than the element at index `i` in `lit`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
