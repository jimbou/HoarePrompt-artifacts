Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit` that must have at least 4 elements, `s` is the number of pairs of consecutive elements in `a` where the second element is greater than the first, plus 1 if `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. If `b[i]` is greater than `b[i - 1]`, then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `s` remains the same.***
