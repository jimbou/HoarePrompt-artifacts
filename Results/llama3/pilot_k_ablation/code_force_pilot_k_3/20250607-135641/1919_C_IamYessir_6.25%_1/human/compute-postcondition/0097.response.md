Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is undefined, `a` is either a list containing the first two elements of `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit` or a list containing the last element of `a`, `b` is either a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` or a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 4, `i` is still 3, `lit` is still a list of integers, `cp` is still 0, and `s` is still undefined. The list `a` is either a list containing the first two elements of `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit` or a list containing the last element of `a`. The list `b` is either a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` or a list containing the element at index `i` in `lit` and the element at index `i` in `lit`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
