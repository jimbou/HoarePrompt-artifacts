Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a space-separated list of integers. `cp` is 0. `a` is a list containing the first integer from `lit` and all elements from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`, `b` is a list containing all elements from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the list `a` will contain the first integer from `lit` and all subsequent integers from `lit` that are greater than or equal to the last element of `a`. The list `b` will contain all integers from `lit` that are less than the last element of `a`. The variable `i` will be equal to `n-1`, which is the last index of the loop. The other variables, `n`, `lit`, `stdin`, and `cp`, will remain unchanged.
