Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is `n-1`, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first `n` integers from `lit` if all elements in `lit` are in non-decreasing order, otherwise `a` is a list containing the first `k` integers from `lit` where `k` is the smallest index such that `lit[k]` is greater than `lit[k-1]`, and `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `s` is now defined and has a value of 0. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.
