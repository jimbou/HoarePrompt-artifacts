Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 integers, `b` is a list containing the remaining integers from `lit`, `s` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers. The current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

The code increments the value of `s` by 1. The initial value of `s` was 0, so after the increment, `s` becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]` is still valid.
