Postcondition: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `s` is not defined, `a` is a list containing the first two integers from `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` if the last element of `a` is less than the integer at index `i` in `lit`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the integer at index `i` in `lit` and the integer at index `i` in `lit`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a space-separated list of integers.**
