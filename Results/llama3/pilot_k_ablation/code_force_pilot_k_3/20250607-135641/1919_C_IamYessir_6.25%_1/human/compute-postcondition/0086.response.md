The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `i` is undefined, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is undefined, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 and `i` must be 1.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing the first element of `lit`, `b` is an empty list, `s` is undefined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs**
