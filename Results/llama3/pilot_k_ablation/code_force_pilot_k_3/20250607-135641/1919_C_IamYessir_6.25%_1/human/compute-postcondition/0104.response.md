Output State: **`n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `lit` is a list of integers, `cp` is 0, `a` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `b` is a list containing all elements of `lit` that are greater than the last element of `a`, `s` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]`.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `s` being equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The condition that the current value of `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `a[i - 1]` is still valid.
