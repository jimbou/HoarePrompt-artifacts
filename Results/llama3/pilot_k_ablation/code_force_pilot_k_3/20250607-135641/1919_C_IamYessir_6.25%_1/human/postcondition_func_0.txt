This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It then processes each test case by splitting the integers into two lists, a and b, based on whether each integer is greater than or equal to the last element of a. The function then counts the number of pairs of consecutive elements in both lists where the second element is greater than the first and prints this count. The function repeats this process for all test cases and does not return any value.
