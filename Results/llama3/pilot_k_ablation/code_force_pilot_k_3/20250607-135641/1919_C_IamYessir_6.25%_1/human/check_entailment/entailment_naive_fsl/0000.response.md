Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]. The program will split this into two subsequences [3, 1, 1] and [4, 5], resulting in a penalty of 2. However, the optimal split is [3, 4, 1, 5] and [1], resulting in a penalty of 3. The program does not consider all possible splits and therefore does not always find the minimum possible penalty.
