Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the process described in the problem statement to calculate the minimum possible penalty. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The program correctly splits the input array into two subsequences `a` and `b` based on the condition that every element of `a` is either in `s` or `t`. It does this by iterating through the input array and appending each element to either `a` or `b` based on whether the element is greater than or equal to the last element of `a`.

2. The program correctly calculates the penalty for each subsequence by counting the number of pairs of consecutive elements where the second element is greater than the first. It does this by iterating through each subsequence and incrementing a counter `s` whenever it finds a pair of consecutive elements where the second element is greater than the first.

3. The program correctly prints the total penalty, which is the sum of the penalties for the two subsequences.

4. The program correctly handles the case where the input array has only one element, in which case the penalty is 0.

5. The program correctly handles the case where the input array has no elements, in which case the penalty is also 0.

Overall, the program correctly implements the process described in the problem statement and produces the correct output for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **True**
