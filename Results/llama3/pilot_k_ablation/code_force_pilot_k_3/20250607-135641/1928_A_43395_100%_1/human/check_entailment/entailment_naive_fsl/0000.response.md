Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program will print 'no', but actually, Bob can obtain another rectangle from the 3 x 3 rectangle by cutting it into two 3 x 1 rectangles and then forming a 1 x 6 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sides of the rectangle are even or odd, but it does not consider the case where the sides are odd and the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.

To fix this issue, the program should also check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two sides is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, then the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and Bob can obtain another rectangle.

Here is an example of a corrected program:
```
import math

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if math.gcd(a, b) > 1:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```
This program uses the math.gcd function to calculate the GCD of the two sides, and if the GCD is greater than 1, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'.
