Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if both sides are even, or if one side is even and half of it is not equal to the other side. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'yes', otherwise it prints 'no'. This logic is consistent with the problem description.

The program also correctly handles the input and output. It reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the two integers a and b, and prints the result.

The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors. It correctly uses the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is even, and it correctly uses the division operator (/) to calculate half of a number.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
