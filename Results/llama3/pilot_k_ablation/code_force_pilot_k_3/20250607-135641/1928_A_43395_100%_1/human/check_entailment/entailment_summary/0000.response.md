Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks if both dimensions are even, or if one dimension is even and half of it is not equal to the other dimension. If either of these conditions is true, it prints 'yes', indicating that Bob can obtain another rectangle. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**
