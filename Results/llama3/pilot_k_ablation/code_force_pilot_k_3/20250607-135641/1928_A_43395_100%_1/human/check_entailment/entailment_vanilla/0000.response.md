Reasoning:

The problem requires determining if a given rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides by making a cut parallel to one of the sides of the original rectangle, and then forming another rectangle from the two resulting rectangles.

The provided program attempts to solve this problem by checking the following conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are even, it prints 'yes'.
2. If `a` is even and `a/2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b/2` is not equal to `a`, it prints 'yes'.
3. Otherwise, it prints 'no'.

However, this program is incorrect. The conditions checked do not accurately determine if another rectangle can be formed from the two resulting rectangles.

For example, consider the case where `a = 3` and `b = 2`. The program will print 'no', but it is actually possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two `3 x 1` rectangles and then forming a `1 x 6` rectangle.

Another example is the case where `a = 2` and `b = 4`. The program will print 'yes', but it is actually not possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two `2 x 2` rectangles.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
