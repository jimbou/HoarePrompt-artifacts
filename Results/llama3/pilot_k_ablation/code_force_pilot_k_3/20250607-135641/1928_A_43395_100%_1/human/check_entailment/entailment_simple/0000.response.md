Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. 

The program first checks if both a and b are even. If they are, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be divided into four equal smaller rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

If both a and b are not even, the program checks if either a or b is even and if the other dimension is not equal to half of the even dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be divided into two equal smaller rectangles, which can then be rearranged to form a different rectangle.

If neither of the above conditions is met, the program prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be divided into two equal smaller rectangles, and therefore, another rectangle cannot be formed.

Correctness: **True**
