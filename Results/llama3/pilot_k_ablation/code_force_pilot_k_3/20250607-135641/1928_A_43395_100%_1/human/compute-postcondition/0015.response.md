Output State: **`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-2 (1 <= t-2 <= 10^4-2), each of the following t-2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `input`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the stdin now contains one less line of input, as one line has been read and processed to assign values to `a` and `b`. The first line of stdin now contains a single integer `t-2`, and each of the following `t-2` lines contains two integers `a` and `b`.
