Output State: **`input` is a valid integer and is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to the value of `input`, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 and are the values of the last line of stdin, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line has been read and the rest of the lines have been read and processed. If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input has been fully processed, and the final values of `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The loop has printed 'yes' or 'no' for each pair of integers based on the conditions specified in the loop body. The input stream has been fully consumed, and the loop has terminated.
