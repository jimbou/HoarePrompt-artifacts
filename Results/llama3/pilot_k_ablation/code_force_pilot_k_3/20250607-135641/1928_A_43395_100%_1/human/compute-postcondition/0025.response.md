Output State: **`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 and are the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line has been read and the rest t-2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the values of the first line of stdin, which contains two integers. The rest of the stdin remains the same, containing t-2 lines of input, each with two integers. The values of `input` and `i` remain unchanged.
