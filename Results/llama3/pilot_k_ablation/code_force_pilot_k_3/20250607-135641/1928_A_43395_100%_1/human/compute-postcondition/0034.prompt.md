Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 == 0 and b % 2 == 0:
        print('yes')
    elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` or both are odd, then 'yes' is printed if either `a` is even and `a/2` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and `b/2` is not equal to `a`. Otherwise, if either both `a` and `b` are even and `a/2` equals `b` or both `a` and `b` are even and `b/2` equals `a`, then 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-2 (1 <= t-2 <= 10^4-2), each of the following t-2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'yes' is printed. If either `a` is even and not equal to twice `b`, or `b` is even and not equal to twice `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `input` is a valid integer and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 and are the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line has been read and the rest t-2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
