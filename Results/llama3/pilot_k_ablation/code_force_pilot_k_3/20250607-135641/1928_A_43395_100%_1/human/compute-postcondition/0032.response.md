Postcondition: ***`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9 and are the values of the first line of stdin, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line has been read and the rest t-2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
