Output State: **`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to be integers between 1 and 10^9, as they are assigned the values from the input. The value of `input` is still a valid integer and greater than 0, and the value of `i` remains 0. The stdin now contains multiple lines of input, with the first line containing a single integer t-1, and each of the following t-1 lines containing two integers a and b.
