The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input.  If the input is a valid integer and is greater than 1 the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, input is a valid integer and is greater than 1, i is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input is a valid integer and is greater than 1 and the i is 2.
State: **`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (1 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'yes' is printed. If either `a` is even and not equal to twice `b`, or `b` is even and not equal to twice `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**
