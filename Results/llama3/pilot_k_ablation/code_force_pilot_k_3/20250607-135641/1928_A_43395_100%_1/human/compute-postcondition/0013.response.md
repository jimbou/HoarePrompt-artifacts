Postcondition: ***`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-1 (0 <= t-1 <= 10^4-1), each of the following t-1 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'yes' is printed. If either `a` or `b` or both are odd, then 'yes' is printed if either `a` is even and `a/2` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and `b/2` is not equal to `a`. Otherwise, if either both `a` and `b` are even and `a/2` equals `b` or both `a` and `b` are even and `b/2` equals `a`, then 'no' is printed.***
