Postcondition: ***`input` is a valid integer and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and 10^9, stdin contains multiple lines of input, the first line contains a single integer t-2 (1 <= t-2 <= 10^4-2), each of the following t-2 lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). If either a is even and not equal to twice b, or b is even and not equal to twice a, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
