Functionality: **This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and each subsequent line contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It then checks each pair of integers (a, b) and prints 'yes' if both are even, or if one is even and half of it is not equal to the other. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function processes all input lines and prints the corresponding results.**
