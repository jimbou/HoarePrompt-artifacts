This function checks if the first half of a given string of lowercase Latin characters is the same as the reversed second half. If the string length is even, it compares the two halves directly. If the string length is odd, it compares the first half with the reversed second half, excluding the middle character. The function returns True if the two halves match and False otherwise.
