Postcondition: ***`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`. If the length of `ch` is even, then if the first half of `ch` satisfies the condition `func_1(ch[:b])`, `a` is 3, otherwise `a` is 4. If the length of `ch` is odd, then if the function `func_1` returns `True` for the first half of the string `ch`, `a` is 1, otherwise `a` is 2.***
