Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, the current value of `ch` from index 0 to `b` satisfies the condition `func_1(ch[:b])`, `a` is 3.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `a` and assigned it the value 3. The values of the other variables, `ch` and `b`, remain unchanged. The length of `ch` is still even, and `b` is still equal to half the length of `ch`. The condition `func_1(ch[:b])` is still satisfied for the current value of `ch` from index 0 to `b`.
