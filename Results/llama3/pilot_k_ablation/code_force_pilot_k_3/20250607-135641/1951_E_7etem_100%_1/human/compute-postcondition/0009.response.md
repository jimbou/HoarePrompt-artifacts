Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is an odd number, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, `a` is 1, and the current value of `func_1(ch[:b])` is True.**

In this output state, the code has introduced a new variable `a` and assigned it the value 1. The other variables, `ch` and `b`, remain unchanged, and the condition `func_1(ch[:b])` is still True. The length of `ch` is still an odd number, and `b` is still equal to half the length of `ch`.
