Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, the length of `ch` is even, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`, the function `func_1` returns `False` when applied to the first half of `ch`, and `a` is 4.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 4, while the values of `ch` and `b` remain unchanged. The length of `ch` is still even, and `b` is still equal to half the length of `ch`. The function `func_1` still returns `False` when applied to the first half of `ch`.
