Output State: **`ch` is a string of lowercase Latin characters, `b` is an integer equal to half the length of `ch`**.

In this output state, the value of `ch` remains unchanged as it was in the initial state, which is a string of lowercase Latin characters. The new variable `b` is introduced and assigned the value equal to half the length of `ch`. This means that `b` will be an integer representing the middle index of the string `ch` if the length of `ch` is even, or the index just before the middle if the length is odd.
