Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where a string needs to be partitioned into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to check if a string is a palindrome and to determine how to partition the string, respectively.

The program first checks if the input string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse. If it is a palindrome, the program sets `T1` to `False`. If the length of the string is greater than 2 and the string is composed of a repeated substring of length 2, the program also sets `T1` to `False`.

If `T1` is still `True`, the program calls `func_1` to check if the string is a palindrome. If it is, the program sets `T1` to `False`. If the length of the string is greater than 3, the program calls `func_2` to determine how to partition the string. If `func_2` returns 1, the program checks if the second half of the string is a palindrome. If it is, the program sets `T1` to `False`. If `func_2` returns 2, the program checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome. If it is not, the program sets `T1` to `False`.

If `T1` is still `True`, the program partitions the string according to the value returned by `func_2`. If the value is 0, the program prints "YES" and the original string. If the value is 1, the program prints "YES" and the string partitioned into two substrings. If the value is 2, the program prints "YES" and the string partitioned into two substrings. If the value is 3, the program prints "YES" and the string partitioned into two substrings. If the value is 4, the program prints "NO".

The program's logic is correct, and it handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
