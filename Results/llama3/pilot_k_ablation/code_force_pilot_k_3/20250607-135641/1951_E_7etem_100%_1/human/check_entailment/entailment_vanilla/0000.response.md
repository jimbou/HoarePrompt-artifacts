Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` checks if a given string `ch` is a palindrome. It does this by comparing the first half of the string with the reversed second half. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

`func_2` takes a string `ch` as input and returns an integer value based on the length of the string and whether the first half of the string is a palindrome. The function uses `func_1` to check if the first half of the string is a palindrome.

However, there are several issues with the program:

1. The program does not actually partition the input string into substrings. It only checks if the first half of the string is a palindrome and returns an integer value based on that.
2. The program does not handle the case where the input string has an odd length. In such cases, the middle character is not considered when checking if the first half of the string is a palindrome.
3. The program does not provide any output as required by the problem statement. It only returns an integer value, but does not print "YES" or "NO" as required.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
