Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program consists of multiple functions, including `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to check if a string is a palindrome and to determine the partitioning of the string, respectively.

The main part of the program iterates over each test case, checks if the input string is a palindrome using `func_1`, and then applies `func_2` to determine the partitioning of the string. Based on the result of `func_2`, the program either prints "YES" along with the partitioned string or "NO" if no valid partitioning is found.

The execution summaries of `func_1` and `func_2` provide insight into their behavior. `func_1` checks if the first half of a string is the same as the reversed second half, excluding the middle character if the string length is odd. `func_2` takes a string as input and returns an integer value based on the length of the string and the result of applying `func_1` to the first half of the string.

Based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of the functions, the program appears to be correct. It correctly checks if a string is a palindrome, determines the partitioning of the string using `func_2`, and prints the appropriate output based on the result.

Correctness: **True**
