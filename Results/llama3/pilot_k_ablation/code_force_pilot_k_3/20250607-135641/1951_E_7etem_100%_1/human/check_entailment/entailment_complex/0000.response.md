Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of partitioning a string into substrings such that each substring is not a palindrome. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to achieve this.

`func_1` checks if the first half of a given string is the same as the reversed second half. If the string length is even, it compares the two halves directly. If the string length is odd, it compares the first half with the reversed second half, excluding the middle character.

`func_2` takes a string as input and returns an integer value based on the length of the string and the result of applying `func_1` to the first half of the string. If the length of the string is even, the function returns either 3 or 4. If the length of the string is odd, the function returns either 1 or 2.

The main program uses these functions to determine if a given string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings. It first checks if the entire string is a palindrome or if it consists of a single repeated character. If not, it calls `func_1` to check if the string can be partitioned into two non-palindromic substrings. If `func_1` returns True, it calls `func_2` to determine the number of partitions required.

The program then uses the result of `func_2` to partition the string accordingly. If the string can be partitioned into non-palindromic substrings, it prints "YES" followed by the number of partitions and the partitioned substrings. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the logic to partition a string into non-palindromic substrings and handles various edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
