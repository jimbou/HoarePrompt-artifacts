Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the program to partition the input string into substrings that are not palindromes, but the program does not provide any logic to achieve this. The two functions provided, `func_1` and `func_2`, seem to be checking if a string is a palindrome or not, but they do not provide any way to partition the string into non-palindrome substrings.

For example, if the input string is "abba", the program should return "YES" and partition the string into two substrings "ab" and "ba", which are not palindromes. However, the program does not provide any logic to achieve this.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
