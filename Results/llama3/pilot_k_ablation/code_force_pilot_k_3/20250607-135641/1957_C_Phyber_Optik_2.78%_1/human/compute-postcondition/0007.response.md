Output State: `dp` is a list with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to 7, `dp[4]` equal to 15, `dp[5]` equal to 31, `dp[6]` equal to 63, `dp[7]` equal to 127, `dp[8]` equal to 255, `dp[9]` equal to 511, `dp[10]` equal to 1023, `n` is 10, `i` is 10.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list `dp` with values calculated based on the given formula, and the loop counter `i` is equal to the value of `n`, which is 10.
