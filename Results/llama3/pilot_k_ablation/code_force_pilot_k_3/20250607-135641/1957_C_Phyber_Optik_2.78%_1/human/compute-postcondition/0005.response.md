The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **`dp` is a list with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to 7, and `dp[4]` equal to 15, `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5**
