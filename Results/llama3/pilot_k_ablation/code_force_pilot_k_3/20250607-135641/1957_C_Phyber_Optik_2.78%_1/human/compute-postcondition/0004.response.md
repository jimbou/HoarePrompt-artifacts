Output State: **`dp` is a list with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to 7, and `dp[4]` equal to 15, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `dp[4]` has been calculated using the given formula, which is `(dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`. Substituting the known values, we get `(7 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`, which simplifies to `15`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
