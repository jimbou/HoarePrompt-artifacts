Output State: **`dp` is a list with `dp[1]` equal to 1, `dp[2]` equal to 3, `dp[3]` equal to 7, `dp[4]` equal to 15, `dp[5]` equal to 31, `n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5**

In this output state, the value of `dp[5]` is calculated using the given formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Substituting `i` with 5, we get `dp[5] = (dp[4] + 2 * 4 * dp[3]) % 1000000007`. Since `dp[4]` is 15 and `dp[3]` is 7, we have `dp[5] = (15 + 2 * 4 * 7) % 1000000007 = (15 + 56) % 1000000007 = 71 % 1000000007 = 31`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.
