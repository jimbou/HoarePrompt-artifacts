Reasoning: 

The problem asks us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The given program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem. The dp array is used to store the number of possible final configurations for a given number of remaining valid moves.

The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3, which are correct because there is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board and three ways to place a rook on a 2x2 board (two ways to place a white rook and one way to place a black rook).

The recurrence relation is dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. This is also correct because we have two options for each remaining valid move: we can either place a white rook or a black rook. If we place a white rook, we have dp[i - 1] options for the remaining moves. If we place a black rook, we have dp[i - 2] options for the remaining moves, and we can place the black rook in (i - 1) different positions.

The program then uses the dp array to find the number of possible final configurations for the given number of remaining valid moves, which is n - len(invalid).

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
