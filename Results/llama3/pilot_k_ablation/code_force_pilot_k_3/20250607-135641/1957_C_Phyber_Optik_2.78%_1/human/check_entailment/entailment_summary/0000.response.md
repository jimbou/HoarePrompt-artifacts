Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves, modulo 10^9+7.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible configurations for each size of the chessboard from 1 to n. The dynamic programming function `func_1` calculates the nth term of a sequence where each term is the sum of the previous term and twice the product of the current index and the term two positions before, modulo 1000000007.

The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions where a rook cannot be placed), and then prints the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid positions.

The execution summary correctly describes the behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
