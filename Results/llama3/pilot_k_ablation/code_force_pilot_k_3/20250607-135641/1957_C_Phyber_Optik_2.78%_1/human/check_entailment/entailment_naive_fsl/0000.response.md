Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves. The dynamic programming approach used in the program is correct, and the base cases are properly handled.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size 300007, where dp[i] represents the number of possible configurations for an i x i chessboard. The function func_1 calculates the values of dp[i] for i from 1 to 300000.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases t, and for each test case, the size of the chessboard n and the number of moves k. It then reads the k moves and stores the rows and columns of the moves in a set invalid.

The program then prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which represents the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid moves.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the move, and it correctly calculates the number of possible configurations for the remaining valid moves.

The program also correctly handles the case where the number of moves k is 0, in which case the number of possible configurations is equal to the number of possible configurations for an n x n chessboard, which is dp[n].

The program correctly handles the case where the number of moves k is equal to n, in which case the number of possible configurations is 1, because there is only one possible configuration for an n x n chessboard with n moves.

The program correctly handles the case where the number of moves k is greater than n, in which case the number of possible configurations is 0, because it is not possible to make more moves than the size of the chessboard.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
