Reasoning:

The problem requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. The given program uses dynamic programming to solve this problem.

The dynamic programming array dp is used to store the number of different final configurations possible for a chessboard of size i. The base cases are dp[1] = 1 and dp[2] = 3.

The recurrence relation is dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007. This relation is derived from the fact that we can place a rook in the current row in two ways: either by placing it in a new column (which gives dp[i - 1] possibilities) or by placing it in a column where a rook is already present (which gives 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2] possibilities).

The program then reads the input and calculates the number of invalid positions (i.e., positions where a rook is already present). It then prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which is the number of different final configurations possible.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the dynamic programming solution to the problem. The recurrence relation is correct, and the base cases are properly handled. The program also correctly reads the input and calculates the number of invalid positions.

However, there is a small issue with the program. The function func_1 is called with the argument 300000, but the size of the chessboard can be up to 3 * 10^5. Therefore, the function func_1 should be called with the argument 3 * 10^5 instead of 300000.

Correctness: **True**
