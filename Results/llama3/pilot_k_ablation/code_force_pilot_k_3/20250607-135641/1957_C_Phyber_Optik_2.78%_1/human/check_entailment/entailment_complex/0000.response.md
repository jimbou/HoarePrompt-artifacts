Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The problem requires us to find the number of different final configurations possible when we continue the game after k moves. This can be calculated using dynamic programming, where each state represents the number of possible configurations for a given number of remaining rows and columns.

2.  The program initializes a list dp of size 300007 with all elements set to -1. It then calls the function func\_1(300000) to calculate the dp values for indices up to 300000.

3.  Inside the function func\_1(n), the base cases dp\[1\] and dp\[2\] are set to 1 and 3, respectively. Then, a loop is used to calculate the dp values for indices from 3 to n. The formula used to calculate dp\[i\] is (dp\[i - 1\] + 2 \* (i - 1) \* dp\[i - 2\]) % 1000000007.

4.  After calculating the dp values, the program reads the number of test cases t and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the size of the chessboard n and the number of moves k. It then creates a set invalid to store the rows and columns that are already occupied by rooks.

5.  The program then prints the value of dp\[n - len(invalid)\], which represents the number of possible final configurations for the given test case.

6.  The use of dynamic programming and the formula to calculate dp\[i\] are correct, and the program handles the modulo operation correctly to avoid overflow.

7.  The program also correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move when r = c.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
