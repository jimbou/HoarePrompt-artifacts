Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly handles the two types of operations:

    *   When `d` is odd (i.e., `d & 1` is true), it appends an integer `e` to the end of the array `a`. The size of the array is incremented by 1, and the value `e` is stored in the dictionary `b` with the current size of the array as the key.
    *   When `d` is even (i.e., `d & 1` is false), it appends `e` copies of the current array `a` to the end of `a`. The size of the array is multiplied by `e + 1`.
2.  The program correctly handles the queries:

    *   It reverses the list `a` to get the sizes of the array in reverse order.
    *   For each query `x`, it finds the corresponding element in the array by repeatedly subtracting 1 from `x` and taking the modulus with the current size of the array `i`. This effectively "wraps around" the array to find the correct element.
    *   If the resulting index `x` is in the dictionary `b`, it returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, it returns `None`.
3.  The program correctly handles the edge case where the size of the array exceeds 10^19. In this case, it simply skips the operation and continues with the next one.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
