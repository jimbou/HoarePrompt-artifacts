Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of array a after a series of operations. The program uses a list a to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary b to store the elements of the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and the number of queries. It then reads the operations and updates the list a and dictionary b accordingly.

After reading all the operations, the program reverses the list a and reads the queries. For each query, it calls the function func_1 to find the k-th element of the array.

The function func_1 takes an integer x as input and returns the k-th element of the array. It first checks if x is in the dictionary b, and if so, it returns the corresponding value. If x is not in the dictionary b, it iterates over the list a in reverse order, updating x to be the remainder of x-1 divided by the current size of the array, plus 1. This process continues until x is in the dictionary b, at which point the function returns the corresponding value.

The program then prints the results of the queries for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
