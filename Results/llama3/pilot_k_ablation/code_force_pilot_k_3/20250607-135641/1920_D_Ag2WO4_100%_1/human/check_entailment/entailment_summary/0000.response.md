Reasoning:

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It correctly handles the two types of operations (appending an integer and appending copies of the array) and processes the queries to find the k-th element of the array.

The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the values of the elements in the array. The program iterates through the operations, updating the size of the array and storing the values of the elements in the dictionary.

To process the queries, the program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `x` as input and returns the value of the x-th element in the array. The function uses the list `a` and the dictionary `b` to find the correct element.

The program then reads the queries, applies the `func_1` function to each query, and prints the results.

Based on the execution summary, the program correctly handles the input and produces the expected output.

Correctness: **True**
