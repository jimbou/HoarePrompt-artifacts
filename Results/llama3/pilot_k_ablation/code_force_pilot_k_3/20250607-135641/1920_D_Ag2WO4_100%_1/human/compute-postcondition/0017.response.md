Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and the last element of a (inclusive), a is a list of integers that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, i is the last element in the list a. If x is in b, the program returns the element at index x in list b. Otherwise, the program returns None.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of x will be between 1 and the last element of list a (inclusive). The list a must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop. The variable i will be the last element in the list a. If x is in list b, the program will return the element at index x in list b. If x is not in list b, the program will return None.
