Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and the third element of `a` (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list `a`. If `x` is in list `b`, the program returns the value at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program returns None.***
