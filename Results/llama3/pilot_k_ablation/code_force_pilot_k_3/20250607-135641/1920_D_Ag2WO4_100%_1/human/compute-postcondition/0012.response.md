Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and the second element of `a` (inclusive), `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list `a`. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
