Functionality: **This function takes a list of integers as input, where the first element represents the number of test cases, and each test case is described by a list of integers. The function iterates through the list, updating the number of test cases based on the elements in the list, and checks if the updated number is present in another list 'b'. If it is, the function returns the corresponding element from list 'b'. If not, the function returns None. The function effectively maps the input list to an element in list 'b' based on the number of test cases, or returns None if no mapping is found.**
