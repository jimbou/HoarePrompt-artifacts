Reasoning:

1. The problem asks to find the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts, considering the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

2. The given Python program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of yogurts (n), the price for one yogurt (a), and the price for two yogurts on promotion (b).

3. The program calculates two possible costs:
   - s1: the cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a)
   - s2: the cost of buying n yogurts using the promotion (b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a), where (n // 2) is the number of pairs of yogurts that can be bought at the promotion price, and (n % 2) is the remaining yogurt that needs to be bought at the regular price.

4. The program prints the minimum cost between s1 and s2 for each test case.

5. The program correctly handles the cases where n is even or odd, and it correctly calculates the minimum cost considering the promotion.

6. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors.

Correctness: **True**
