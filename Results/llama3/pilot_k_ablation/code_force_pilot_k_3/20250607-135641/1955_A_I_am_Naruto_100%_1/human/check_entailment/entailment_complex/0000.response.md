Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` from the standard input, which is within the specified range of `1 <= t <= 10^4`.

2. For each test case, the program reads three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` from the standard input, which are also within their specified ranges of `1 <= n <= 100` and `1 <= a, b <= 30`.

3. The program calculates two values: `s1` is the total cost of buying `n` yogurts at the regular price `a`, and `s2` is the total cost of buying `n` yogurts with the promotion price `b`. The calculation of `s2` correctly handles the case where `n` is odd by adding the cost of one yogurt at the regular price `a`.

4. The program prints the minimum of `s1` and `s2`, which represents the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy `n` yogurts.

5. The program repeats this process for `t` test cases, as specified in the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying `n` yogurts based on the given prices and promotion.

Correctness: **True**
