Reasoning:

The given program is designed to calculate the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts. The program takes into account the promotion where two yogurts can be bought for b burles.

The program calculates two possible costs:

- s1: The cost of buying n yogurts at the regular price (n * a).
- s2: The cost of buying n yogurts with the promotion (b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a). This calculation takes into account the integer division of n by 2 (to get the number of pairs of yogurts) and the remainder of n divided by 2 (to get the number of single yogurts).

The program then prints the minimum value between s1 and s2.

This approach correctly considers all possible scenarios:

- If n is even, the program will choose the minimum cost between buying all yogurts at the regular price and buying all yogurts in pairs with the promotion.
- If n is odd, the program will choose the minimum cost between buying all yogurts at the regular price and buying pairs of yogurts with the promotion and the remaining single yogurt at the regular price.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
