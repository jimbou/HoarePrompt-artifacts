Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka". It considers two scenarios: buying all yogurts at the regular price (s1) and buying as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price, with any remaining yogurts bought at the regular price (s2). The program then prints the minimum of these two costs.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If n is even, the program buys all yogurts in pairs at the promotion price, which is the optimal solution.
* If n is odd, the program buys as many pairs of yogurts as possible at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt at the regular price, which is the optimal solution.
* If the promotion price is not advantageous (i.e., b > 2a), the program buys all yogurts at the regular price, which is the optimal solution.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly:

* If n = 1, the program buys the single yogurt at the regular price, which is the optimal solution.
* If n = 2, the program buys the two yogurts at the promotion price, which is the optimal solution.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum cost of buying n yogurts at "Vosmiorochka" and handles all potential cases correctly.
