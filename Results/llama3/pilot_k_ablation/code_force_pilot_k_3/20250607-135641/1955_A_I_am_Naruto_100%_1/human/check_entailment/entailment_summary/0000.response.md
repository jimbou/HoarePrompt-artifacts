Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts at the "Vosmiorochka" store. The program reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. It calculates two values, s1 and s2, based on these inputs, and prints the minimum of these two values.

The program correctly calculates the minimum cost of buying n yogurts by considering two scenarios:

1.  Buying all yogurts at the regular price (s1 = n \* a)
2.  Buying yogurts in pairs at the promotion price and the remaining yogurt (if any) at the regular price (s2 = b \* (n // 2) + n % 2 \* a)

The program then prints the minimum of these two values, which represents the minimum amount of burles Maxim should spend to buy n yogurts.

Correctness: **True**
