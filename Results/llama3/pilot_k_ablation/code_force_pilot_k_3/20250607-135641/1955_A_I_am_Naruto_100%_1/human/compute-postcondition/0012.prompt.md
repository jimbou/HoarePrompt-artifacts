Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    s1 = n * a
    s2 = b * (n // 2) + n % 2 * a
    print(min(s1, s2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is the product of n and a, s2 is the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), _ is 0, and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is the product of n and a, s2 is the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), _ is 1, and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is being printed, and the minimum value between the product of n and a and the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is the product of n and a, s2 is the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), _ is 2, and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is being printed, and the minimum value between the product of n and a and the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2 is printed, and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
