To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The loop variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so its value doesn't affect the state.
2. The `range` function is used with `int(input())`, which means the loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the integer input from the user.
3. Since we are at the end of the previous iteration, the value of `_` is not relevant, but the value of `t` is. Specifically, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

Considering the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 100
* `a` is an integer between 1 and 30
* `b` is an integer between 1 and 30
* `s1` is the product of `n` and `a`
* `s2` is the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2 plus the product of `a` and the remainder of `n` divided by 2
* `stdin` contains `t-1` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30)
* `_` is 0
* The minimum value between `s1` and `s2` is being printed

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we only need to consider the loop head. Since `_` is not used, we only need to adjust the value of `t`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, `b` is an integer between 1 and 30, `s1` is the product of `n` and `a`, `s2` is the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2 plus the product of `a` and the remainder of `n` divided by 2, `stdin` contains `t` lines, each containing three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` (1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 30), `_` is 1, and the minimum value between `s1` and `s2` is being printed**
