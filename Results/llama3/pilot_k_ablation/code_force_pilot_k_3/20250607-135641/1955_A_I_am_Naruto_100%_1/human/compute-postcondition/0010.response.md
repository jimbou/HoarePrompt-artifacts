The code prints the minimum value between the product of n and a, and the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2.
Output: **min(n * a, b * (n // 2) + a * (n % 2)) (where n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, and b is an integer between 1 and 30)**
