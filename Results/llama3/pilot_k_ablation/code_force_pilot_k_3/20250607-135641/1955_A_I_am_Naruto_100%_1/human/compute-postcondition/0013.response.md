Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: n, a, and b. It calculates two values, s1 and s2, based on these inputs, and prints the minimum of these two values. The function repeats this process for a number of test cases specified by the first integer read from standard input.**
