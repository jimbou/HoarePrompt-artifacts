The code prints the minimum value between `s1` and `s2`. Where `s1` is the product of `n` and `a`, and `s2` is the product of `b` and the integer division of `n` by 2 plus the product of `a` and the remainder of `n` divided by 2. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `a` is an integer between 1 and 30, and `b` is an integer between 1 and 30.
Output: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is the product of n and a, s2 is the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), _ is 0, and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is being printed**
