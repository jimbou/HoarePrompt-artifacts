Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is the product of n and a, s2 is the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), _ is 1, and the minimum value between s1 and s2 is being printed**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` have been updated based on the input from `stdin`. The values of `s1` and `s2` have also been updated based on the new values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. The number of lines in `stdin` has decreased by 1, as one line has been read and processed. The value of `_` remains unchanged, and the minimum value between `s1` and `s2` is being printed.
