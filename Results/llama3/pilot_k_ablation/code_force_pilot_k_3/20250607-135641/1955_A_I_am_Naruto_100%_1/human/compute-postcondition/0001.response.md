The code snippet reads a line from stdin containing three integers n, a, and b, and assigns them to the variables n, a, and b, respectively. The first line of the code then calculates the value of s1 by multiplying n and a, and the second line calculates the value of s2 by multiplying b and the integer division of n by 2, adding the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 1 and 30, b is an integer between 1 and 30, s1 is the product of n and a, s2 is the product of b and the integer division of n by 2 plus the product of a and the remainder of n divided by 2, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing three integers n, a, and b (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= a, b <= 30), _ is 0**
