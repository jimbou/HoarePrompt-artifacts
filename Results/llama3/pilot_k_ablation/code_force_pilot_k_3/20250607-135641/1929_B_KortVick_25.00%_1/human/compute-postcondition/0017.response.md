The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is being printed, where `k // 2 + 1` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^8 (inclusive). Otherwise, the smallest integer not less than `k` divided by 2 is being printed.**
