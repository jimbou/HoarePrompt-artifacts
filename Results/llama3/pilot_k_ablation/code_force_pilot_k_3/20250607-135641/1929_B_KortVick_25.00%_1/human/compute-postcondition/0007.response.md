The code prints the ceiling of the division of `k` by 2.
Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), and either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, the ceiling of `k / 2` will be the integer division of `k` by 2, rounded up to the nearest integer.
Output: **the ceiling of k / 2 (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2 inclusive)**
