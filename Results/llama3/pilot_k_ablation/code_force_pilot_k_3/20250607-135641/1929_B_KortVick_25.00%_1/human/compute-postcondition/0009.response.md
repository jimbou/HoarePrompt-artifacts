Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, the value being printed is half of `k` plus 1, which is an even number. Otherwise, either `k` is odd or `k` is even and half of `k` is even, and the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed.***
