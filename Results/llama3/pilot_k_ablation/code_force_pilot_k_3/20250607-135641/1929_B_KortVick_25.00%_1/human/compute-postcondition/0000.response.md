The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains multiple test cases, and each test case contains two integers `n` and `k`. The first input is accepted and assigned to `t`, which means `t` is now equal to the number of test cases.

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^8 and 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2.**
