Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either `k` is odd, or `k` is even and `k // 2` is even, and the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed**
