The code prints the result of the expression `k // 2 + 1`, where `k` is an integer between 1 and 4 * `n` - 2 (inclusive).

Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4 * `n` - 2 (inclusive), the value of `k // 2` will be an integer between 0 and 2 * `n` - 1 (inclusive).

Adding 1 to this value will result in an integer between 1 and 2 * `n` (inclusive).

Therefore, the output will be an integer between 1 and 2 * `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive).

Output: **an integer between 1 and 2 * n (inclusive)**
