Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is being printed, where `k // 2 + 1` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^8 (inclusive). Otherwise, the smallest integer not less than `k` divided by 2 is being printed.***
