Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), and the value of `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive). The stdin now contains one less test case than before, as one test case has been read and processed.
