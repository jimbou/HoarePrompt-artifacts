The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
