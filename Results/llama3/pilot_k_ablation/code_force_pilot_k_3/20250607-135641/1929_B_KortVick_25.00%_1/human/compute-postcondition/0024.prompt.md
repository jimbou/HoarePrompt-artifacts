Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^8 and 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if k % 2 == 0 and k // 2 % 2 == 1:
        print(k // 2 + 1)
    else:
        print(ceil(k / 2))


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `k` is even and half of `k` is odd, the value being printed is half of `k` plus 1, which is an even number. Otherwise, either `k` is odd or `k` is even and half of `k` is even, and the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is being printed, where `k // 2 + 1` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^8 (inclusive). Otherwise, the smallest integer not less than `k` divided by 2 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4 * `n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
