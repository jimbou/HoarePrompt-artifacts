The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the number of test cases and stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^8 and 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2. So for the loop to be executed  `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers `n` and `k` such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^8 and 1 <= `k` <= 4`n` - 2**
