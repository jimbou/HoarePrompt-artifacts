Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values, which are integers between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive) and between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), respectively. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus two, as one test case has been read and processed.
