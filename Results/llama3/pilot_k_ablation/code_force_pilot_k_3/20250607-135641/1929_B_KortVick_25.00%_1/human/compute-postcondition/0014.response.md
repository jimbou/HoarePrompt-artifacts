The `print(ceil(k / 2))` statement will print the ceiling of half of the value of `k`.

Since `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), and `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), the value of `k` can be any integer within this range.

The `ceil` function returns the smallest integer not less than the given number. Therefore, `ceil(k / 2)` will return the smallest integer not less than half of the value of `k`.

Output: **the ceiling of half of the value of k (where k is an integer between 1 and 4n - 2, and n is an integer between 2 and 10^8)**
