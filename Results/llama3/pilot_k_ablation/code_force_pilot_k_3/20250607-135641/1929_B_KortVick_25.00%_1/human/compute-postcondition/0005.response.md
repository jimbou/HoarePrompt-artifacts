Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `t` is the number of test cases, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4`n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of `k` is even, and half of `k` is odd, and the value of `k // 2 + 1` is being printed, which is equal to half of `k` plus 1, and since half of `k` is odd, the value being printed is an even number**
