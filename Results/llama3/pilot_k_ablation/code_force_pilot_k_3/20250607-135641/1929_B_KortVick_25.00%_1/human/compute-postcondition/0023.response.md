Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^8 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 1 and 4 * `n` - 2 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If `k` is even and `k // 2` is odd, the value of `k // 2 + 1` is printed. Otherwise, the ceiling of `k` divided by 2 is printed.***
