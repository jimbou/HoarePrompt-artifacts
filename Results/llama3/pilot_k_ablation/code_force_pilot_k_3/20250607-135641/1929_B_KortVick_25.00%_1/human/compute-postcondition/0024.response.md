Output State: **`_` is equal to `t`, stdin is empty.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the loop variable `_` has reached the value of `t`, which is the number of test cases. The stdin is empty because all the test cases have been processed. The values of `n` and `k` are no longer relevant as they were only used within the loop.
