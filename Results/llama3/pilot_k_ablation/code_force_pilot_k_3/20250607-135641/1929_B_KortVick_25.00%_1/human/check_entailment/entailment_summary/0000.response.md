Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum number of cells that need to be colored in an n x n grid such that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. The program uses a simple mathematical approach to solve this problem.

The program first checks if k is even and k/2 is odd. If this condition is true, it prints k/2 + 1. Otherwise, it prints the ceiling of k/2.

The reasoning behind this approach is as follows:

- If k is even and k/2 is odd, it means that k/2 is an odd number. In this case, we need to color at least k/2 + 1 cells to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. This is because each diagonal can have at most one colored cell, and we need to cover all k diagonals.

- If k is not even or k/2 is not odd, it means that k/2 is an even number. In this case, we need to color at least k/2 cells to ensure that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell. This is because each diagonal can have at most one colored cell, and we need to cover all k diagonals.

The program's approach is correct because it covers all possible cases and ensures that at least k diagonals have at least one colored cell.

Correctness: **True**
