Output State: **`n` and `k` are assigned the next two values from the stdin, `m` is an integer greater than 0, and stdin contains the remaining values.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the next two integer values from the stdin, which were previously not specified. The value of `m` remains unchanged, still being an integer greater than 0. The stdin now contains the remaining values after reading the next two integers for `n` and `k`.
