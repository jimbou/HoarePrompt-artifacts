Functionality: **The function reads a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where each pair represents the number of nodes (n) and the number of edges (k) in a graph. It then prints the minimum number of nodes that must be removed to make the graph a tree, which is either 1 (if the graph is already a tree or can be made into one by removing a single node) or the total number of nodes (n) if the graph has more edges than a tree with n nodes can have. The function processes multiple pairs of integers, one pair per line, and prints the result for each pair.**
