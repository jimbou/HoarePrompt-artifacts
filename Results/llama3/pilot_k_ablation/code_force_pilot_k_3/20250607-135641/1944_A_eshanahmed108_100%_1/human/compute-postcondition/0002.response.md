To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer.
- `k` is an integer.
- stdin contains no input.

Code Snippet:
```python
print(n if n - k > 1 else 1)
```

Explanation:
The `print` statement contains a conditional expression that evaluates to either `n` or `1`, depending on the condition `n - k > 1`.

- If `n - k > 1`, the expression evaluates to `n`. This means the value of `n` will be printed.
- If `n - k` is not greater than `1` (i.e., `n - k <= 1`), the expression evaluates to `1`. This means the value `1` will be printed.

Since the exact values of `n` and `k` are not provided, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `n - k` or determine which branch of the conditional expression will be taken. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either the value of `n` if `n - k > 1` or the value `1` if `n - k <= 1`.

Output: **n if n - k > 1, otherwise 1**
