Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Function `func_1` calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, which is used in the calculation of the number of permutations.

Function `func_2` takes the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, and R, and checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R. If not, it returns 0. Then, it checks if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If not, it returns 0. If M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the number of permutations by recursively calling `func_1` and multiplying the result by decreasing values of L[-1] modulo MOD, until reaching 1.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of permutations based on the given input parameters. It handles the edge cases correctly and returns 0 when the input parameters do not satisfy the conditions. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
