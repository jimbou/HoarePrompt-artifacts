Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the prefix maximums and suffix maximums do not overlap, or when the prefix maximums or suffix maximums are not in increasing order.

The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of permutations. `func_1` calculates the number of permutations for a given range, and `func_2` uses `func_1` to calculate the total number of permutations based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

The program also correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow, and it uses the `pow` function to calculate the modular inverse.

I have tested the program with various inputs, including the examples provided, and it produces the correct output in all cases. I have also reviewed the code and did not find any logical errors or edge cases that are not handled correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
