The variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is L[-1] - 2, So for the loop to be executed one more time L[-1] needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and i currently must be greater than 1.
State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], then cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and i is L[-1] - 2. Otherwise, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and i is L[-1] - 2 and L[-1] is greater than 3 and i is greater than 1**
