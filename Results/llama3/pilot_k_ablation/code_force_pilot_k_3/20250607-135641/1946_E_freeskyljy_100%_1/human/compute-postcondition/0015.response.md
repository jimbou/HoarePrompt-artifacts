Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1 and L[-1] is greater than 2. The current value of i is equal to the current value of L[cur].**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been decremented by 1, so it is now `M1 - 3`. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true, including the relationships between the elements of `L` and `R`, and the values of `ans`, `nums_left`, and `i`.
