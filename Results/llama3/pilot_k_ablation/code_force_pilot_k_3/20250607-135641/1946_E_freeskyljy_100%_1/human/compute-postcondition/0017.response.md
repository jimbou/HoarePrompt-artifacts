Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `M2` is a positive integer, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `L[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `R[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `MOD` is a positive integer, `ans` is a value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, `cur` is `M1 - 2`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 2`, `i` is `L[-1] - 1`, and `L[-1]` is greater than 2. `i` is not equal to `L[cur]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which is `L[-1] - 2`) and taking the result modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
