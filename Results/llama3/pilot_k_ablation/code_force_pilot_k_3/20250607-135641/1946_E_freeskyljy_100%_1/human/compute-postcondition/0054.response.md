Postcondition: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is 1, then the current value of L is the same as the initial value of L. If M1 is greater than 1, then either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If M2 is greater than 1, then ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo MOD, cur is M2, i is N, and nums_left is 0. Otherwise, cur is 0, i is 1, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1.**
