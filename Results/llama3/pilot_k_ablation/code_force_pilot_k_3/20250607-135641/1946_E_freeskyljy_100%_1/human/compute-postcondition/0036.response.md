The only variable in the loop head is variable i and N, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables i and N. If i is less than N, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, i is R[0] + 1 and N is a positive integer. R[0] is the first element of R and the last element of L, and the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, so R[0] is equal to L[-1]. The first element of L is 1, so L[-1] is not equal to 1. The last element of R is N, so R[0] is not equal to N. N being a positive integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to N is greater than R[0] + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is a positive integer greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is 1, then the postcondition is the same as the precondition. If M1 is greater than 1, then the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo MOD, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1**
