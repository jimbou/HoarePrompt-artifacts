Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is 1, then the postcondition is the same as the precondition. If M1 is greater than 1, then the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo MOD, cur is 1, i is R[0] + 1, and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1.**

In this output state, the values of N, M1, M2, L, R, MOD, and stdin remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of cur has been updated to 1, and the value of i has been updated to R[0] + 1. The value of nums_left remains N - R[0] - 1. The value of ans remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code.
