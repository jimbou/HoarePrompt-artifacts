Output State: **The program returns a value that is a result of a series of multiplications and modulo operations, involving the last element of list L, the function func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), and the positive integer MOD. The exact value depends on the values of M1, M2, L, and R, but it is a result of a recursive calculation that involves multiplying the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) by decreasing values of L[-1] modulo MOD, until reaching 1.**
