Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `M2` is a positive integer, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `L[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `R[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `MOD` is a positive integer, `cur` is `M1 - 5`, `nums_left` is `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is `L[-1] - 3`. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. Either `M2` is 1 or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `ans` is not returned. Otherwise, `ans` is a value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, and then either `ans` is not multiplied by `L[-1] - 3` modulo `MOD`, or `ans` is multiplied by `L[-1] - 3` modulo `MOD`. `L[-1]` is greater than 4 and `i` is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cur` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `cur` being `M1 - 5`. The values of `nums_left`, `i`, `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `MOD` remain unchanged. The relationships between the elements of `L` and `R` also remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is either not returned or is a result of a function call multiplied by some values modulo `MOD`, depending on the value of `i`.
