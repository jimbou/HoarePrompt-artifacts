Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[1]` + 2, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `L[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `R[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `MOD` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains no input, `ans` is a value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `L[-1]` - 2 modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `L[-1]` - 3 modulo `MOD`, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `N - R[0] - 2` modulo `MOD`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is `R[1]` + 1 and `i` must be less than `N`, `cur` is 2, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. The value of `nums_left` has been updated to `N - R[0] - 3`. The value of `i` has been updated to `R[1]` + 1. The value of `cur` is 2, and `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
