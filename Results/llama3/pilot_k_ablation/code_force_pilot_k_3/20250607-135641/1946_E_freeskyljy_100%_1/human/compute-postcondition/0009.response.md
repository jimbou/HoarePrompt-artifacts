Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M1 is 1, M2 is 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.***
