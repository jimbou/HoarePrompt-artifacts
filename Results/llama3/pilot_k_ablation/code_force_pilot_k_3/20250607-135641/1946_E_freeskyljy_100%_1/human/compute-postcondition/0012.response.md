Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.**

In this final state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for the addition of two new variables: `nums_left` and `i`. The value of `nums_left` is set to `L[-1] - 2`, which is two less than the last element of list `L`. The value of `i` is set to `L[-1] - 1`, which is one less than the last element of list `L`. All other variables retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
