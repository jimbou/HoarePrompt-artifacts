Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, i is L[-1] - 1.
Code of the loop:
while i > 1:
    if i == L[cur]:
        cur -= 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], then cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and i is L[-1] - 2. Otherwise, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 3, and i is L[-1] - 2.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], then cur is M1 - 4, nums_left is L[-1] - 4, and i is L[-1] - 3. Otherwise, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, and then either cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 4, and i is L[-1] - 3, or cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 4, i is L[-1] - 3, and ans is multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and L[-1] is greater than 3 and i is greater than 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], then cur is M1 - 5, nums_left is L[-1] - 5, and i is L[-1] - 4. Otherwise, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, and then either cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 5, and i is L[-1] - 4, or cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 5, i is L[-1] - 4, and ans is multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and L[-1] is greater than 4 and i is greater than 1. If i is not equal to L[cur], then ans is now equal to ans * (L[-1] - 5) % MOD.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
