Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[1] + 2`, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `L[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `R[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `MOD` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains no input. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. If `M1` is 1, then the current value of `L` is the same as the initial value of `L`. If `M1` is greater than 1, then the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. `ans` is a value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `L[-1] - 3` modulo `MOD`, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo `MOD`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 4 and `i` is `R[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` is 3, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `ans` is multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`. In both cases, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`. `i` is equal to `R[1]` and `i` must be less than `N`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 4 and `i` is `R[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` is 3, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `ans` is multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `N - R[0] - 2` modulo `MOD`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is `R[1] + 1` and `i` must be less than `N`.**

The code increments the value of `cur` by 1. The initial value of `cur` is either 2 or 3. If `cur` is 2, then it becomes 3. If `cur` is 3, then it becomes 4. The value of `i` is still `R[1]`. The value of `nums_left` is still `N - R[0] - 2`. The value of `ans` is still the value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `L[-1] - 3` modulo `MOD`, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo `MOD`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 4 and `i` is `R[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` is 3, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `ans` is multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`. In both cases, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 4 and `i` is `R[1]`. Otherwise, `cur` is 3, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, and `ans` is multiplied by `N - R[0] - 1` modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `N - R[0] - 2` modulo `MOD`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is `R[1] + 1` and `i` must be less than `N`.
