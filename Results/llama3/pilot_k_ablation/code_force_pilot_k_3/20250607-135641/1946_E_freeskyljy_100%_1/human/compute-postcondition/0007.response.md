Postcondition: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is equal to the second element of R.**
