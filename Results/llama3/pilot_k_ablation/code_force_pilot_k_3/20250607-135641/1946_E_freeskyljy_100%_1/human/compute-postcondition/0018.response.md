Postcondition: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], then cur is M1 - 3, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, and i is L[-1] - 1. Otherwise, ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, cur is M1 - 2, nums_left is L[-1] - 2, and i is L[-1] - 1.**
