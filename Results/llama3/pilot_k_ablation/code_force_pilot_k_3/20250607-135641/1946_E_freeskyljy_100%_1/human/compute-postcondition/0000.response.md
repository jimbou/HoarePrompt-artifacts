Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input.**

The code block reads three positive integers from stdin and assigns them to N, M1, and M2, respectively. Then, it reads M1 distinct positive integers from stdin and assigns them to list L, and M2 distinct positive integers from stdin and assigns them to list R. After executing the code block, stdin is empty, and the values of N, M1, M2, L, and R are updated accordingly. The value of MOD remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
