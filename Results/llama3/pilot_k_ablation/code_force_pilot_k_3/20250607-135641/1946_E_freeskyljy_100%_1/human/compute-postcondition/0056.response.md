Functionality: **This function calculates a value based on the input parameters N, M1, M2, L, R, and MOD. It first checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, and if not, returns 0. Then, it checks if the first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N, and if not, returns 0. If M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is equal to the second element of R, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates a value by recursively calling the function func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) and multiplying the result by decreasing values of L[-1] modulo MOD, until reaching 1. The function returns this calculated value.**
