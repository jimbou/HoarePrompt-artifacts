Output State: **N is a positive integer greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is 1, then the current value of L is the same as the initial value of L. If M1 is greater than 1, then the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo MOD, cur is 2, i is R[1], and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1. The current value of i is equal to the current value of R[cur].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2, and the value of `i` is now equal to the second element of `R`, which is `R[1]`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
