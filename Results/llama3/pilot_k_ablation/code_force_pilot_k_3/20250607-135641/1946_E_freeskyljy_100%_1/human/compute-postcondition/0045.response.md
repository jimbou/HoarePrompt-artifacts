Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[1]` + 1, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of `M1` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `L[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `R` is a list of `M2` distinct positive integers such that 1 <= `R[i]` <= `N` for all `i`, `MOD` is a positive integer, `stdin` contains no input, `ans` is a value returned by `func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1)` multiplied by `L[-1] - 2` modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `L[-1] - 3` modulo `MOD`, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo `MOD`, then multiplied by `N - R[0] - 2` modulo `MOD`, `i` is equal to `R[1]`, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, and `MOD` remain the same. The value of `ans` is updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which is `N - R[0] - 2`) modulo `MOD`. The value of `i` is still equal to `R[1]`, and `nums_left` is still `N - R[0] - 2`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
