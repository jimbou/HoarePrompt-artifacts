Output State: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is 1 or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, and then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and then multiplied by L[-1] - 4 modulo MOD, and so on, until i is 1, cur is -1, nums_left is 0, and i is 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of 'ans' is the result of the function func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by all the numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 1, modulo MOD. The variables 'cur' and 'nums_left' are decremented to -1 and 0, respectively, and 'i' is 1. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
