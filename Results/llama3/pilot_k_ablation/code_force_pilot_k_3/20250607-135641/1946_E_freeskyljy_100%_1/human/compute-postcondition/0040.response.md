Output State: **N is a positive integer greater than R[0] + 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is 1, then the postcondition is the same as the precondition. If M1 is greater than 1, then the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo MOD, then multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD, cur is 1, i is not equal to R[cur], and nums_left is N - R[0] - 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated by multiplying it with `nums_left` (which is `N - R[0] - 1`) modulo `MOD`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
