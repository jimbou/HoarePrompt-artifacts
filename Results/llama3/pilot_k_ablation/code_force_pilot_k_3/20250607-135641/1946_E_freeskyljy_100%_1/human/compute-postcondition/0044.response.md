Output State: **N is a positive integer greater than R[1] + 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is 1, then the current value of L is the same as the initial value of L. If M1 is greater than 1, then the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo MOD. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 3 and i is R[1]. Otherwise, cur is 2, i is not equal to R[cur], and ans is multiplied by N - R[0] - 1 modulo MOD. In both cases, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2. i is equal to R[1] and i must be less than N.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cur` being either 2 or 3, depending on the previous value of `cur`. The other variables remain unchanged.
