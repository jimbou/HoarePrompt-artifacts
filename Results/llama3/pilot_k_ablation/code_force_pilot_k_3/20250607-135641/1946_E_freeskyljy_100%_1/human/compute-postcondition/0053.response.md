Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of M1 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= L[i] <= N for all i, R is a list of M2 distinct positive integers such that 1 <= R[i] <= N for all i, MOD is a positive integer, stdin contains no input. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is 1, then the current value of L is the same as the initial value of L. If M1 is greater than 1, then the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is a value returned by func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by L[-1] - 2 modulo MOD, then multiplied by L[-1] - 3 modulo MOD, and so on, until multiplied by 1 modulo MOD. cur is M2, i is N, and nums_left is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the variables in the loop head and body. The loop iterates until i is no longer less than N, at which point cur is equal to M2, i is equal to N, and nums_left is 0. The value of ans is the result of the function func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) multiplied by all the numbers from L[-1] - 2 down to 1 modulo MOD.
