Calculates the binomial coefficient (n1 choose n2) modulo MOD, where n1 and n2 are non-negative integers and n2 is less than or equal to n1. If n1 equals n2 or n2 equals 0, the function returns 1. Otherwise, it calculates the product of all integers from 1 to n1 modulo MOD, and multiplies it by the modular multiplicative inverse of the product of all integers from 1 to n1 - n2 modulo MOD and the product of all integers from 1 to n2 modulo MOD, modulo MOD.
