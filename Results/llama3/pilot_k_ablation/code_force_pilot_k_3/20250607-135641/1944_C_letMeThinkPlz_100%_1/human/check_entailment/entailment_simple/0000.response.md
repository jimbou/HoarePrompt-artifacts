Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the optimal strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize it.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1.  It first counts the occurrences of each number in the array `arr` using a dictionary `counter`.
2.  Then, it iterates over the numbers from 0 to `n-1` (inclusive) and checks the following conditions:

    *   If a number `i` is not present in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it means that Bob can remove all occurrences of `i` and Alice cannot include it in her array `c`. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be `i`, and the program sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
    *   If a number `i` is present only once in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`) and `once` is `False`, it means that Alice can include `i` in her array `c` and Bob cannot remove it. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be `i+1`, and the program sets `ans` to `i+1` and sets `once` to `True`.
    *   If a number `i` is present only once in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`) and `once` is `True`, it means that Alice cannot include `i` in her array `c` because Bob can remove it. Therefore, the MEX of `c` will be `i`, and the program sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop.
3.  Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which represents the MEX of Alice's array `c` if both players play optimally.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
