Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the MEX of the array `c` by iterating through the possible values from 0 to `n` and checking if each value is present in the array. If a value is not present, it is the MEX. The program also handles the case where a value appears only once in the array, in which case the MEX is the next value.

The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each value in the array, which allows it to efficiently check if a value is present in the array. The program also uses a variable `once` to keep track of whether a value has appeared only once in the array, which is used to determine the MEX.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program handles all possible inputs and edge cases, including the case where the array is empty, the case where all values in the array are the same, and the case where the array contains duplicate values.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
