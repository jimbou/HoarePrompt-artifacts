Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array `a` and appending them to another array `c`, with the goal of maximizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of `c`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and iterating over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.
3. It creates a dictionary `counter` to store the frequency of each element in the array.
4. It initializes a variable `ans` to store the final answer and a flag `once` to track whether a single occurrence of an element has been found.
5. It iterates over the range of `n` and checks the frequency of each element in the `counter` dictionary.
6. If an element is not present in the `counter` dictionary (i.e., its frequency is 0), it sets `ans` to the current index `i` and breaks the loop.
7. If an element has a frequency of 1 and the `once` flag is not set, it sets `once` to `True` and `ans` to `i + 1`.
8. If an element has a frequency of 1 and the `once` flag is already set, it sets `ans` to the current index `i` and breaks the loop.
9. Finally, it prints the value of `ans` as the final answer.

The program's logic is based on the following insights:

* If an element is not present in the array, it means that Alice can never pick it, so the MEX of `c` will be at least the index of that element.
* If an element has a frequency of 1, it means that Alice can pick it only once. If she picks it, Bob can never pick it, so the MEX of `c` will be at least the index of that element plus 1.
* If an element has a frequency greater than 1, it means that Alice can pick it multiple times. In this case, Bob can always pick one of the remaining occurrences of that element, so the MEX of `c` will be at least the index of that element.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
