Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the smallest integer that is either missing from the list or appears only once in the list, which is the MEX of the list.

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it reads the size of the array `n` and the array `arr` itself.
3. It then creates a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each integer in the array.
4. The program then iterates over the range of integers from 0 to `n-1` and checks the following conditions:
   - If an integer `i` is not present in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 0`), it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop. This is because the MEX is the smallest non-negative integer that does not occur in the array.
   - If an integer `i` is present only once in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`) and `once` is `False`, it sets `once` to `True` and `ans` to `i + 1`. This is because if an integer is present only once, the MEX will be the next integer.
   - If an integer `i` is present only once in the array (i.e., `counter.get(i, 0) == 1`) and `once` is `True`, it sets `ans` to `i` and breaks the loop. This is because if an integer is present only once and `once` is already `True`, the MEX will be the current integer.
5. Finally, the program prints the value of `ans`, which is the MEX of the array.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
