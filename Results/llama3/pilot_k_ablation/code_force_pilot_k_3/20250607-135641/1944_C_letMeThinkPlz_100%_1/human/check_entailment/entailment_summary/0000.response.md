Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and for Bob to minimize it. The program iterates through the array and checks the count of each number in the array. If a number is missing (i.e., its count is 0), it sets the answer to that number and breaks the loop. If a number appears only once and it's the first time it encounters such a number, it sets the answer to the next number and continues. If a number appears only once and it's not the first time, it sets the answer to the current number and breaks the loop. This strategy ensures that Alice maximizes the score and Bob minimizes it.

Correctness: **True**
