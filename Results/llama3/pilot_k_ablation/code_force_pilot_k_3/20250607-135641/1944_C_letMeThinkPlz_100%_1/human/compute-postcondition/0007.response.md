The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the first integer in the list arr plus 1, and the count of the second integer in the list is incremented by 1 in the counter dictionary. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in the list and counter is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the first integer in the list arr plus 1, the second integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the second integer in the list arr plus 1 and the third integer in the list as a key and its value is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, i is the third integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the first integer in the list arr plus 1, the second integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the second integer in the list arr plus 1 and the third integer in the list as a key and its value is 1**
