Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), counter is an empty dictionary, i is n, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t - 2` test cases because two test cases have been consumed by the code. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive) as it is assigned the value of the first line of the test case. The `arr` list is now populated with `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (0 <= a_i < n) from the second line of the test case. The `counter` dictionary is empty as it is initialized as an empty dictionary. The value of `i` is `n` as it is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `ans` is the smallest integer missing from the list, and `once` is True as they are not modified by the code. The smallest integer missing from the list, which is `ans`, is being printed.
