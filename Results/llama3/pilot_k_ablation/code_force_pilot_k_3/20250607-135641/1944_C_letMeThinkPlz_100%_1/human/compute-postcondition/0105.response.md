Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin is empty, ans is 2, once is True**

The code snippet modifies the values of `once` and `ans`. The first line sets `once` to `True`. The second line increments `ans` by 1, making it equal to 2, since `i` is 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `arr`, `counter`, `t`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
