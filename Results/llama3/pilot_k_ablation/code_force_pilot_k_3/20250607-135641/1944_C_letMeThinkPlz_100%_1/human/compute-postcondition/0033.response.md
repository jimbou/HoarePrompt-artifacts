Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 2, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1, once is True, ans is 3.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `counter` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code only modifies the values of `once` and `ans`. The first line sets `once` to `True`, and the second line sets `ans` to `i + 1`, which is 3 since `i` is 2.
