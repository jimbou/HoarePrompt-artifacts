Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 0, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1, ans is 0, once is False, and the value of i is already present in the counter dictionary with a count greater than 0. Additionally, either the count of i in the counter dictionary is not equal to 1 or once is True.***
