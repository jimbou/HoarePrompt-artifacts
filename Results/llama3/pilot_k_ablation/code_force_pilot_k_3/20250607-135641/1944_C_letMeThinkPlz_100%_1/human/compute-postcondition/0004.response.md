Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in the list arr plus 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, and the stdin still contains `t - 1` test cases. The value of `n` is still between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), and the list `arr` still contains `n` integers between 0 and `n - 1` (inclusive). The value of `i` is still the first integer in the list `arr`. The `counter` dictionary now has `i` as a key, and its value is the count of `i` in the list `arr` plus 1.
