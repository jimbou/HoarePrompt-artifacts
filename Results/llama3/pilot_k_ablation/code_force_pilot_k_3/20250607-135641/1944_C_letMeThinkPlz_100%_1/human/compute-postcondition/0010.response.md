Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `t` remains an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), indicating the number of test cases.
* `stdin` still contains `t - 1` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (0 <= a_i < n).
* `n` is still an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), representing the size of the input array.
* `arr` is now an empty list, as all elements have been processed by the loop.
* `i` is the last integer in the original list, as the loop has iterated over all elements.
* `counter` is a dictionary where all integers in the original list are keys, and their values are the counts of each integer in the list `arr` plus 1. This means that the dictionary contains the frequency of each integer in the input array, with each count incremented by 1.
