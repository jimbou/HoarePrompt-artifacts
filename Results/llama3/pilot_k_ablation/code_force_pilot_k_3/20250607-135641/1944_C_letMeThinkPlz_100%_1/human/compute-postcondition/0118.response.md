The code prints the smallest integer that is not present in the list `arr` or is present only once in `arr`. This integer is stored in the variable `ans`. Since the exact elements in the list `arr` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest integer that meets the specified conditions.

Output: **the smallest integer that is not present in the list `arr` or is present only once in `arr`**
