Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 5 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n) that must have at least 2 elements, i is the third element in the list, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in the list incremented by 1, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed, and the count of i in the counter dictionary is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of the counter dictionary with key i is incremented by 1, and all other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The counter dictionary now contains the updated count of the third element in the list.
