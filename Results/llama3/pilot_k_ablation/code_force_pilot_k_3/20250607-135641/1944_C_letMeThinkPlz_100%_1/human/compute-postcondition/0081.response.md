State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `i` is n-1, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list. If counter.get(i, 0) == 0, then ans is n-1. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once), then once is True and ans is n. If the count of n-1 in the counter is 1, then ans is n-1, otherwise no change occurs, and ans is printed**
