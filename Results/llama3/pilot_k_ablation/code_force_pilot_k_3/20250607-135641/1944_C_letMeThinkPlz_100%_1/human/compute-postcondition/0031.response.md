The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 2, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 0, then ans is 1 and once is True. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is True, then ans is 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans is 0, and once is False if the count of i in the counter dictionary is greater than 1, otherwise once is True.**
