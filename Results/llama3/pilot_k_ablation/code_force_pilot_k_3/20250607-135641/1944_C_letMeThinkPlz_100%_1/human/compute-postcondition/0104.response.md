Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin is empty, ans is 1, once is False**

The code assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 1. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
