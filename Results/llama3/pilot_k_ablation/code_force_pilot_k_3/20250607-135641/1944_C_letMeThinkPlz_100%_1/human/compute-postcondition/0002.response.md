The code snippet reads two lines of input for each test case. The first line assigns the value of the input integer to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers to `arr`. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `counter`.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), counter is an empty dictionary**
