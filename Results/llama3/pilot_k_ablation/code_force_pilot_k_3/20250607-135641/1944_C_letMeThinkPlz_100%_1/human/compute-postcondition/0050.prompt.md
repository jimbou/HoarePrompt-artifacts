Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), counter is an empty dictionary, i is n, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n) that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in the list, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 4 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n) that must have at least 1 element, i is the second element in the list, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in the list incremented by 1, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 5 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n) that must have at least 2 elements, i is the third element in the list, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in the list incremented by 1, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed, and the count of i in the counter dictionary is incremented by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
