Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 0, counter is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list, ans is 1, and once is True.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `once` to `True`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`. Since `i` is 0, `ans` becomes 1. No other variables are affected by the code. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `counter` remains unchanged.
