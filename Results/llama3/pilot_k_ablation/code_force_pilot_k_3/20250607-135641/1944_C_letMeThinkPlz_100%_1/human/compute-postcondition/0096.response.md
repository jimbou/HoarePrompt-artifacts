The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line sets the value of `once` to `True`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is 0, ans is 1, once is True, stdin is empty. The value of i is present in counter with a count greater than 0. The current value of counter.get(i, 0) is 1.**
