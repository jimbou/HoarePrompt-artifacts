The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 2, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list**
