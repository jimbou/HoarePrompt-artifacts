Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the input state remains the same, but the loop variables change as follows: the list `arr` becomes empty, the variable `i` takes the value of the last integer in the list, and the dictionary `counter` contains all integers from the list as keys with their values being the counts of these integers in the list plus 1.
