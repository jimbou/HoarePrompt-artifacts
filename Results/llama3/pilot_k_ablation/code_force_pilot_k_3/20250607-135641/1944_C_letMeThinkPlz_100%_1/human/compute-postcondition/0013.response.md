Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 0, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1, ans is 0, once is False. The current value of i is not present as a key in the counter dictionary or its count is 0.**
