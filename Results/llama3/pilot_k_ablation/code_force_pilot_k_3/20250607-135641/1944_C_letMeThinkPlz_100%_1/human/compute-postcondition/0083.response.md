According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n-1`. So for the loop to be executed  the list `arr` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is the first integer in the list, `stdin` is empty**
