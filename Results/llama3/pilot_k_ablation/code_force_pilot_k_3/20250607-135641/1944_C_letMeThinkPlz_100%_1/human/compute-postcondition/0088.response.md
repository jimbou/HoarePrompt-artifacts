Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 3 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 3 as its value, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is the third integer in the list, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to 3, since it was initially 2 and the code increments it by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, as they were not affected by the code.
