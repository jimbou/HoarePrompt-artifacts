The code `counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1` updates the value of `counter[i]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `arr`, the value of `counter[i]` is now 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is the first integer in the list, `stdin` is empty**
