Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), ans is equal to i, i is increased by 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `arr`, `counter`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is increased by 1. The stdin remains empty as it was initially empty and no input operations were performed.
