To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least one more integer, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least one integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, and `counter` has `i` as a key with its value being the count of `i` in the list `arr` plus 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `arr` must have at least one more integer, and `i` must be the next integer in the list. Since `i` is the first integer in the list, the next integer in the list must be the second integer.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the first integer in the list arr plus 1**
