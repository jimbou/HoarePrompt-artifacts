Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1, ans is 0, once is False.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1`, `a_2`, …, `a_n` (0 <= `a_i` < `n`), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list `arr` plus 1, if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 0, then `ans` is 0 and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0, and `once` is False if the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is greater than 1, otherwise `once` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 1, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 0, then ans is 1 and once is True. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is True, then ans is 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans is 0, and once is False if the count of i in the counter dictionary is greater than 1, otherwise once is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 2, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 0, then ans is 1 and once is True. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is True, then ans is 1 and once is True. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is greater than 1, then ans is 0 and once is False. Otherwise, ans is 1 and once is True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
