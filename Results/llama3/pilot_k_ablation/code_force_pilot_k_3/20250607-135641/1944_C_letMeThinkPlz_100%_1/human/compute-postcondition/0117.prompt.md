Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is the last integer in the list, ans is 0, once is False, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is not present in `counter` or its count is 0, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is present in `counter` with a count greater than 0, then if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin is empty. If the value of i is not present in arr, then ans is 1. If the value of i is present only once in arr and once is False, then ans is 2 and once is True. If the value of i is present only once in arr and once is True, then ans is 1. If the value of i is present more than once in arr, then ans is 0 and once is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin is empty, i is increased by 1. If the count of the current integer i in the counter dictionary is 0, then ans is equal to the new value of i. If the count of the current integer i in the counter dictionary is 1 and once is False, then once is set to True and ans is equal to i + 1. Otherwise, if the count of the current integer i in the counter dictionary is 1, then ans is equal to i.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
