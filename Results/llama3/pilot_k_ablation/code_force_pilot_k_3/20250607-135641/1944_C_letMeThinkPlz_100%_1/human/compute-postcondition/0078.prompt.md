Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is the last element in the list, counter is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list, ans is 0, and once is False, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
        ans = i
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 0, then `ans` is 0 and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 1, counter is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 0, then ans is 1 and once is True. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is 2. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is equal to 1 and once is True, then ans is 1 and once is False. If the count of i in the counter dictionary is not equal to 1, then ans is 0 and once is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 2, arr is an empty list, i is 2, counter is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list. If counter.get(i, 0) == 0, then ans is 2. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once), then once is True and ans is 3. If the count of 2 in the counter is 1, then ans is 2, otherwise no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
