Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is n, stdin is empty, ans is the smallest integer that is not present in arr or is present only once in arr, once is True if there is an integer that is present only once in arr and False otherwise.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the end of the list `arr`, and the variable `ans` has been updated to be the smallest integer that is either not present in `arr` or is present only once in `arr`. The variable `once` is set to `True` if there is an integer that is present only once in `arr`, and `False` otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged.
