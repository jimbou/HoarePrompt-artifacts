The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 0, then `ans` is 0 and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` is False.**
