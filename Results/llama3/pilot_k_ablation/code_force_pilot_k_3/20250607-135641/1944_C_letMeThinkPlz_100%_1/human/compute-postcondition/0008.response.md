Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 integers, i is the third integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with the first integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the first integer in the list arr plus 1, the second integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the second integer in the list arr plus 1 and the third integer in the list as a key and its value is the count of the third integer in the list arr plus 1.**

In this output state, the value of the counter for the third integer in the list has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
