Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is 1, counter is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list, ans is 1, once is False.**

The code snippet only contains two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, making `ans` equal to 1. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. The initial state of `once` is False, and it remains unchanged since there is no code that modifies it. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `i`, and `counter`) are not affected by the code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
