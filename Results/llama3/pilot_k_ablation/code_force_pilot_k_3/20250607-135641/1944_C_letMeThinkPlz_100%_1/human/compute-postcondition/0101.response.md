Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arr` and its value is the number of times it appears in `arr`, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is 0, `stdin` is empty. The value of `i` is present in `counter` with a count greater than 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, then `ans` is 1 and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `once` remains unchanged.***
