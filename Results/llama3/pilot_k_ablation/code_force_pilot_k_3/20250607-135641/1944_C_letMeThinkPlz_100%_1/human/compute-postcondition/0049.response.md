Output State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is the last element in the list, counter is a dictionary with all elements in the list as keys and their values are the counts of each element in the list, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed.

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the input state remains the same as the initial state, with the exception of the loop variables. The loop variable `i` will be the last element in the list, the `counter` dictionary will contain all elements in the list as keys with their respective counts, and the `ans` variable will still hold the smallest integer missing from the list. The `once` variable remains True, indicating that the smallest integer missing from the list has been printed.
