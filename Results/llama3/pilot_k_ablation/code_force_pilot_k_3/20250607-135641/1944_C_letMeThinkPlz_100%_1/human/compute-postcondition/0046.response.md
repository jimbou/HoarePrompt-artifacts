Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 4 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n) that must have at least 1 element, i is the second element in the list, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in the list incremented by 1, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the count of `i` in the list has increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin containing t - 4 test cases, `n` being an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` being a list of n integers, `i` being the second element in the list, `ans` being the smallest integer missing from the list, and `once` being True.
