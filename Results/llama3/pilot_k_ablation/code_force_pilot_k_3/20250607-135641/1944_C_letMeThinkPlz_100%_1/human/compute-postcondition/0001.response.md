The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive) does ensure that the loop will execute , so it does not need to be adjusted. However, `_` is not defined before the loop starts, so it needs to be adjusted to `_` is 0. 
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n` (0 <= a_i < n), `_` is 0**
