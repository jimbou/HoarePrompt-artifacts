Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 3 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n) that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is the count of i in the list, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been updated to include the count of the first element `i` in the list. The count of `i` is incremented by 1, and this count is stored in the `counter` dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t - 3` test cases, as one test case has been processed.
