Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1:
            ans = i
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is n, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is n-1, counter is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list. If counter.get(i, 0) == 0, then ans is n-1. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once), then once is True and ans is n. If the count of n-1 in the counter is 1, then ans is n-1, otherwise no change occurs, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is n, stdin is empty, ans is the smallest integer that is not present in arr or is present only once in arr, once is True if there is an integer that is present only once in arr and False otherwise, and the smallest integer that is not present in arr or is present only once in arr which is ans is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
