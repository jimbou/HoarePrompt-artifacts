Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 1 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, â€¦, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, counter is a dictionary with all integers in the list as keys and their values are the counts of the integers in the list arr plus 1, ans is 0, once is False.**

The code snippet initializes two variables: `ans` is set to 0, and `once` is set to False. These assignments do not affect any other variables or the state of the input. The rest of the variables and the input remain unchanged.
