Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), n is an integer greater than 2, arr is an empty list, i is 2, counter is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once), then once is True and ans is 3. Otherwise, if the count of 2 in the counter is 1, then ans is 2, otherwise no change occurs.***
