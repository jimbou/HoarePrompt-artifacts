Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is the last integer in the list, stdin is empty**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same range for the number of elements in the list (n) and the range for the value of t. The list (arr) will remain unchanged. The counter dictionary will now contain all integers from the list as keys and their respective counts as values. The variable i will be the last integer in the list. The stdin will remain empty.
