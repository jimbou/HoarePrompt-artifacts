The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, the smallest integer missing from the list which is `ans` is being printed. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the `i` is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains t - 2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n), n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n) that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, counter is an empty dictionary, ans is the smallest integer missing from the list, and once is True, and the smallest integer missing from the list which is ans is being printed**
