Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin is empty. If the value of i is not present in arr, then ans is 1. If the value of i is present only once in arr and once is False, then ans is 2 and once is True. If the value of i is present only once in arr and once is True, then ans is 1. If the value of i is present more than once in arr, then ans is 0 and once is False.***
