Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is the last integer in the list, ans is 0, once is False, stdin is empty**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `ans` and `once`, and assigns them the values 0 and False, respectively. The rest of the variables, `n`, `arr`, `counter`, `t`, and `i`, remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as it is empty and no input operations are performed.
