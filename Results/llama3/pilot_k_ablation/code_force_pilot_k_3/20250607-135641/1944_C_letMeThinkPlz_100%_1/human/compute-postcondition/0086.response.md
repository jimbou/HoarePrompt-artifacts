Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of n integers that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 2 as its value, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `i` is the second integer in the list, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to 2, as it was initially 1 and the code increments it by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `counter` now has the second integer in the list `arr` as a key with a value of 2.
