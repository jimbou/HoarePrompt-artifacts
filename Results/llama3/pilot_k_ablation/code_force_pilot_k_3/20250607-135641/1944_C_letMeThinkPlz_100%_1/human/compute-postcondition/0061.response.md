Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary with all elements from the list as keys and their values are the counts of these elements in the list, `ans` is 0, and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in the `counter` dictionary is equal to 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
