Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin is empty, i is increased by 1. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and once is False, then once is set to True and ans is equal to i + 1. Otherwise, if the count of the current integer i in the counter dictionary is 1, then ans is equal to i.***
