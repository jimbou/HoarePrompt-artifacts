The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, and the second line is a break statement that exits the loop.

Since `i` is 1, `ans` becomes 1. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), i is 1, stdin is empty, ans is 1, once is False**
