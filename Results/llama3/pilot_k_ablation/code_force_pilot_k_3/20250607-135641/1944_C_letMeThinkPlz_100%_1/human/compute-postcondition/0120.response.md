Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive), arr is a list of n integers, counter is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arr and its value is the number of times it appears in arr, i is n, ans is the smallest integer that is not present in arr or is present only once in arr, and once is True if there is an integer that is present only once in arr and False otherwise.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the number of test cases `t` becomes 0, the standard input `stdin` is empty, and the loop variables `n`, `arr`, `counter`, `i`, `ans`, and `once` retain their last values from the previous iteration. The value of `ans` is the smallest integer that is not present in the list `arr` or is present only once in `arr`, and `once` is `True` if there is an integer that is present only once in `arr` and `False` otherwise.
