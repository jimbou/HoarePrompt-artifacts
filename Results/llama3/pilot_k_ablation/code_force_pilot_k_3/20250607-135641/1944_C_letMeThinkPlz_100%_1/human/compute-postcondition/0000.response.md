The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that the first line of the input contains a single integer `t` (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases, the value of `t` is now a specific integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive).

The input still contains multiple test cases, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. Therefore, the remaining input contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (0 <= a_i < n).

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains `t` test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (0 <= a_i < n).**
