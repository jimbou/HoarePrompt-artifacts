Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, …, a_n (0 <= a_i < n).**
