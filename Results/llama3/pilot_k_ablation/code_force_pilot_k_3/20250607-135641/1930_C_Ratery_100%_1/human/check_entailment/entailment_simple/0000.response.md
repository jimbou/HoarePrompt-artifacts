Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, storing the length of the array `n` and the elements of the array `arr`.
2. The program calculates the values of `a_i + i` for each element `a_i` in the array and stores them in the `arr` list. This is done using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index `i` and the value `a_i` of each element in the array.
3. The program sorts the `arr` list in descending order using the `sort` method with the `reverse=True` argument. This ensures that the largest elements are processed first.
4. The program initializes the `ans` list with the largest element of the `arr` list.
5. The program then iterates over the remaining elements of the `arr` list. For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of the `ans` list. If it is, the program appends `ans[-1] - 1` to the `ans` list. Otherwise, it appends `x` to the `ans` list. This ensures that the `ans` list contains the lexicographically largest possible sequence of elements.
6. Finally, the program prints the elements of the `ans` list.

The program's logic is correct, and it produces the expected output for the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
