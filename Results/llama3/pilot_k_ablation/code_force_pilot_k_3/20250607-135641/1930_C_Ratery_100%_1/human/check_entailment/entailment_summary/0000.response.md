Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the lexicographically largest array `b` that can be constructed from the given array `a` by performing the specified operations.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the length of each array, and the elements of each array.
2. The program sorts the array `a` in descending order, which is necessary to find the lexicographically largest array `b`.
3. The program initializes the answer array `ans` with the largest element of `a`.
4. The program iterates through the remaining elements of `a` and appends the maximum of the current element and one less than the last element of `ans` to `ans`. This ensures that `ans` is constructed in a way that maximizes its lexicographical order.
5. The program prints the elements of `ans` for each test case, which is the desired output.

The execution summary accurately describes the program's behavior, and the program's logic is correct based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
