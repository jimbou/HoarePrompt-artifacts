Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first calculates the sum of each element in the array with its index (1-indexed) and stores it in the `arr` list.
2. It then sorts the `arr` list in descending order.
3. The program initializes the `ans` list with the first element of the sorted `arr` list.
4. For each subsequent element `x` in the sorted `arr` list, it checks if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in the `ans` list. If it is, it appends `ans[-1] - 1` to the `ans` list. Otherwise, it appends `x` to the `ans` list.
5. Finally, it prints the elements of the `ans` list.

The program works correctly because it ensures that the elements in the `ans` list are in decreasing order, which is a requirement for the lexicographically largest `b` array. The program also handles the case where an element `x` is equal to the last element in the `ans` list, in which case it appends `ans[-1] - 1` to the `ans` list to maintain the decreasing order.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
