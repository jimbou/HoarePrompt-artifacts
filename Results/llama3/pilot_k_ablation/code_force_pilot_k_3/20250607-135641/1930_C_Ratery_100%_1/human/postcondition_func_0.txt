The function reads a sequence of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer (n) followed by a list of integers (a). It then processes each test case by sorting the list in descending order and creating a new list (ans) where each element is either the corresponding element from the original list or one less than the previous element in ans, whichever is smaller. The function prints the elements of ans for each test case.
