Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a non-negative integer, arr is an empty list, ans is a list containing the largest element of the original arr, either the second largest element of the original arr or ans[-2] - 1, either the third largest element of the original arr or ans[-1] - 1, and so on, until the last element of the original arr or ans[-1] - 1, depending on whether each element of the original arr is less than or greater than or equal to ans[-1].**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input list `arr` is empty, and the output list `ans` contains the largest element of the original `arr`, followed by either the second largest element of the original `arr` or the largest element minus one, followed by either the third largest element of the original `arr` or the second largest element minus one, and so on, until the last element of the original `arr` or the last element of `ans` minus one, depending on whether each element of the original `arr` is less than or greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`.
