Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`, either the second largest element of `arr` or `ans[-2] - 1`, and the third largest element of `arr`, `x` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains unchanged, `arr` is still a sorted list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `ans` now contains the largest element of `arr`, either the second largest element of `arr` or the second last element of `ans` minus 1, and the third largest element of `arr` which is `x`. The value of `x` is still the third element in the list. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
