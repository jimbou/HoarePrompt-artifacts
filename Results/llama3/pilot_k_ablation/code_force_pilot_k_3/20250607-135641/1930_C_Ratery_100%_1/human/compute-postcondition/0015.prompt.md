Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 3 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order, ans is a list containing the largest element of arr.
Code of the loop:
for x in arr[1:]:
    if x >= ans[-1]:
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    else:
        ans.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 3 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a list containing the largest element of arr and either the second largest element of arr or ans[-1] - 1, depending on whether the second largest element of arr is less than or greater than or equal to ans[-1] - 1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, ans is a list containing the largest element of arr, either the second largest element of arr or ans[-2] - 1, and either the third largest element of arr or ans[-1] - 1, depending on whether the third largest element of arr is less than or greater than or equal to ans[-1], x is the third element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 4 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`, either the second largest element of `arr` or `ans[-2] - 1`, either the third largest element of `arr` or `ans[-1] - 1`, and either the fourth largest element of `arr` or `ans[-1] - 1` depending on whether the fourth largest element of `arr` is less than or greater than or equal to `ans[-1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
