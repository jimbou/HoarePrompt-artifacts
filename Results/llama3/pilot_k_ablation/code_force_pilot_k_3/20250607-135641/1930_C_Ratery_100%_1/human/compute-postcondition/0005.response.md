Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and the second largest element of `arr`, and the second largest element of `arr` is less than the last element of `ans`**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending the second largest element of `arr`, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `arr` is sorted in descending order and has at least 2 elements is still valid. The precondition that `x` is the second largest element of `arr` and is less than the last element of `ans` is also still valid.
