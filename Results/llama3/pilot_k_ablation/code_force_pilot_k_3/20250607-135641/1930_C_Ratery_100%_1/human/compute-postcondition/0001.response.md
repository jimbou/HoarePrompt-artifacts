To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `arr`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least two elements, since we're iterating over `arr[1:]`. 

State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, ans is a list containing the largest element of arr, x is the second largest element of arr**
