Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 4 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`, either the second largest element of `arr` or `ans[-2] - 1`, either the third largest element of `arr` or `ans[-1] - 1`, and the fourth largest element of `arr`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the fourth largest element of `arr`, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is still a non-negative integer, and `arr` is still a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order with at least 4 elements.
