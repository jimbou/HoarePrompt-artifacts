Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr` and `ans[-1] - 1`, `x` is the second largest element of `arr` and is greater than or equal to `ans[-1] - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by appending `ans[-1] - 1` to it. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `x` remain unchanged. The condition that `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans` is still satisfied because `ans[-1] - 1` is less than or equal to `x`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
