You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (the length of array a) and then a list of integers (the elements of array a). The length of array a is a non-negative integer and the elements of array a are non-negative integers.
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(sum, enumerate(map(int, input().split()), start=1)))
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    ans = [arr[0]]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        if x >= ans[-1]:
            ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
        else:
            ans.append(x)
        
    #State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a non-negative integer, arr is an empty list, ans is a list containing the largest element of the original arr, either the second largest element of the original arr or ans[-2] - 1, either the third largest element of the original arr or ans[-1] - 1, and so on, until the last element of the original arr or ans[-1] - 1, depending on whether each element of the original arr is less than or greater than or equal to ans[-1].
    print(*ans)
    #This is printed: The elements of the ans list which contains the largest element of the original arr, either the second largest element of the original arr or ans[-2] - 1, either the third largest element of the original arr or ans[-1] - 1, and so on, until the last element of the original arr or ans[-1] - 1, depending on whether each element of the original arr is less than or greater than or equal to ans[-1]

Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
