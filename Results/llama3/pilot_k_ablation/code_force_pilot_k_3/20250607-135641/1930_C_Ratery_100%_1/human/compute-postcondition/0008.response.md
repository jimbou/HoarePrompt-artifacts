Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a non-negative integer, `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order that must have at least 3 elements, `ans` is a list containing the largest element of `arr`, either the second largest element of `arr` or `ans[-2] - 1`, and `ans[-1] - 1`, `x` is the third element in the list**

In natural language, the output state is: The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a non-negative integer. The list `arr` remains the same, containing non-negative integers sorted in descending order with at least 3 elements. The list `ans` now contains one more element, which is one less than its last element before the operation. The value of `x` remains the same as the third element in the list.
