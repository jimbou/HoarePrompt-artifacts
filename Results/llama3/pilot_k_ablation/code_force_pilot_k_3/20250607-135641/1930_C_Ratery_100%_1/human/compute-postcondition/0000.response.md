Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a non-negative integer, arr is a list of non-negative integers sorted in descending order, ans is a list containing the largest element of arr.**

The first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, reducing the number of test cases in stdin by one. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin, assigns each integer a value equal to its index plus one, and stores the results in `arr`. The third line sorts `arr` in descending order. The fourth line assigns the largest element of `arr` to `ans`.
