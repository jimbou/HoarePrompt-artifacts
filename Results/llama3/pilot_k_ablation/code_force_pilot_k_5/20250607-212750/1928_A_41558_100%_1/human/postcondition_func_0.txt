This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) and each of the following t lines contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9). It then checks each pair of integers a and b to determine if they meet certain conditions. If both a and b are odd, or if either a is twice b and b is odd or b is twice a and a is odd, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function continues this process until all input lines have been processed, at which point stdin is empty.
