Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when a and b are both even numbers and a is not equal to b. In this case, the program will print 'YES', but it should print 'NO' because the rectangle can be cut into two identical rectangles, and no other rectangle can be formed.

For example, if the input is 4 6, the program will print 'YES', but the correct output should be 'NO' because the 4x6 rectangle can be cut into two 2x6 rectangles, and no other rectangle can be formed.

The program only checks if a or b is odd, or if a/2 equals b or b/2 equals a, but it does not check the case when both a and b are even and a is not equal to b.
