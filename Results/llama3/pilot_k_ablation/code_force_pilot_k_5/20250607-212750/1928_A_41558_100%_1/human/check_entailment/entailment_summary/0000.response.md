Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO'. This is because if both sides are odd, the rectangle cannot be cut into two rectangles with integer sides.

2. If `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd, or if `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, it prints 'NO'. This is because in these cases, the rectangle can only be cut into two rectangles of the same size, which are considered the same.

3. In all other cases, it prints 'YES'. This is because the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and these two rectangles can be used to form another rectangle that is different from the original one.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
