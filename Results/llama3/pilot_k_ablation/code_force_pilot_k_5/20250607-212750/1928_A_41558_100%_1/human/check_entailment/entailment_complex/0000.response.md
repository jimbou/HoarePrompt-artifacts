Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can obtain another rectangle from the given rectangle. The program checks two conditions:

1. If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.
2. If either `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, it prints 'NO' because no other rectangle can be formed.

If neither of these conditions is true, it prints 'YES' because another rectangle can be formed.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
