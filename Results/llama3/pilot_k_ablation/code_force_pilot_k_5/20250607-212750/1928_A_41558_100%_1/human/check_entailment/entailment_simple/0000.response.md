Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases for the input values of `a` and `b`.

- If both `a` and `b` are odd, it prints 'NO' because in this case, it is impossible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

- If either `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, it prints 'NO' because in these cases, the only possible cut would result in two rectangles that are the same as the original rectangle, which is not considered a different rectangle.

- In all other cases, it prints 'YES' because it is always possible to form another rectangle by cutting the original rectangle into two rectangles with integer sides.

Correctness: **True**
