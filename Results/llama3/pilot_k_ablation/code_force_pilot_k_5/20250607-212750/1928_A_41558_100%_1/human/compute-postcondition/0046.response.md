Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers. The conditions related to the parity of `a` and `b` and the printing of 'YES' or 'NO' are not affected by this code snippet, so they remain the same.
