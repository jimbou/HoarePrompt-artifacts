Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty, but since stdin is now empty we wont include it in the output state.**

In this output state, `n` is still greater than 3, and `i` is still 3. The values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the integers assigned from the input. The conditions regarding the parity of `a` and `b` and the printing of 'YES' or 'NO' are no longer applicable as the code snippet only assigns values to `a` and `b` and does not perform any conditional checks or printing.
