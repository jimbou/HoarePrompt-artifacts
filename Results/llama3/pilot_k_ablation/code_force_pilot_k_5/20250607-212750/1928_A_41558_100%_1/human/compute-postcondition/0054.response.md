Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is double `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is double `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
