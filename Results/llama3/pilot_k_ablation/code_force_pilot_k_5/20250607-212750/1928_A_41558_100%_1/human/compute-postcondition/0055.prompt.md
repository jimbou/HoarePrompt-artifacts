Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and there are n-1 more lines of input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    a, b = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    if a % 2 != 0 and b % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    elif a / 2 == b and b % 2 != 0 or b / 2 == a and a % 2 != 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` and `b` are integers. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` or `b` is even, then if `a` divided by 2 equals `b` and `b` is odd, or `b` divided by 2 equals `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of two integers. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` or `b` is even, then if `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd or `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is double `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is double `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
