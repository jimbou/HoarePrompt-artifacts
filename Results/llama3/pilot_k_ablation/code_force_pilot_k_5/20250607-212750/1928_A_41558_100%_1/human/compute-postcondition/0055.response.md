Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is equal to `n`. The values of `a` and `b` are the last pair of integers read from the input. The input is now empty. The loop prints 'NO' if both `a` and `b` are odd, or if one is twice the other and the other is odd. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.
