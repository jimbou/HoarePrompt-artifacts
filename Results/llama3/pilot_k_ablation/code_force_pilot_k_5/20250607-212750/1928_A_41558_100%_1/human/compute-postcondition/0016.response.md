Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin contains one input: a space-separated list of two integers.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers from the input, while the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one input: a space-separated list of two integers.
