Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input. If both `a` and `b` are odd, 'NO' is printed. If either `a` or `b` is even, then if `a / 2 == b` and `b` is odd or `b / 2 == a` and `a` is odd, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.***
