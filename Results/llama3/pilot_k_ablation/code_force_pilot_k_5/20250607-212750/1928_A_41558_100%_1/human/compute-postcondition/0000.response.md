Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and there are n-1 more lines of input.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is assigned the integer value from the first line of input, which is between 1 and 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin still contains multiple lines of input, but the first line has been consumed by the `input()` function. The remaining lines of input are still present in the stdin, with the first line containing two integers a and b (1 <= a, b <= 10^9), and there are n-1 more lines of input.
