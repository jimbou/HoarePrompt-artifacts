Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'NO' because the condition for printing 'YES' is not met. The condition for printing 'YES' is that either `a` is even and `b` is odd, or `b` is even and `a` is odd. However, according to the initial state, either `a` is even or `b` is even, but not both. Therefore, the condition for printing 'YES' is not satisfied, and the code will print 'NO'.

Output: **NO**
