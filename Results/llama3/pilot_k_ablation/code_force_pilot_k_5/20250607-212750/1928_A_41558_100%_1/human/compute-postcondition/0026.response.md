Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` and `b` are integers that are assigned values from the input, stdin is empty. If both `a` and `b` are odd, then 'NO' is printed. If either `a` is twice `b` and `b` is odd or `b` is twice `a` and `a` is odd, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to the integers read from the input. The stdin is now empty since the input has been read. The conditions for printing 'NO' or 'YES' are still valid, but the specific values of `a` and `b` are now known.
