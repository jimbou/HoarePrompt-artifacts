Output State: **`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4998), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and all other variables and conditions remain the same. The program has moved on to the next test case, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed.
