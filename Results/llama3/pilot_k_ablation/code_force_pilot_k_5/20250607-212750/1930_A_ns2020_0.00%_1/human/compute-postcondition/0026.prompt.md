Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
Code of the loop:
while t:
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(sum(A[::2]))
    t = t - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4999), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4998), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 4997), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4996) and t currently must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4995) and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
