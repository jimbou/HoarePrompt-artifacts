Output State: **`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4996) and t currently must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed, `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed**

The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 0 and 4996 (inclusive). The values of `n` and `A` remain unchanged, as well as the contents of stdin. The sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed.
