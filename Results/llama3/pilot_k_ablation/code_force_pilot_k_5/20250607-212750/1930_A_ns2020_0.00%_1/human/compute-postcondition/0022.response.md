Output State: **t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4996) and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-5 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`, overwriting its previous value. Then, it reads `2n` integers from stdin, splits them into a list, and assigns it to the variable `A`, overwriting its previous value. This reduces the number of test cases in stdin by 1. The sum of all elements at even indices of the list `A` has already been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list `A` which is `sum(A[::2])` is being printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged.
