Output State: **t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 0), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` has reached 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variable `n` still represents the number of integers in each test case, and `A` is still a list of 2n integers. The stdin contains 0 test cases, meaning all test cases have been processed. The sum of all elements at even indices of the list `A` has been printed for each test case.
