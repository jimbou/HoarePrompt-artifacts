Output State: **t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4999), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed.**

The code executes in the following way: the first line reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`, which was previously an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line reads 2n integers from stdin and assigns them to `A`, which was previously a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The sum of all elements at even indices of the list `A` is then printed. The value of `t` is not modified by the code, so it remains an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 4999). The value of `n` is updated to a new integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and the value of `A` is updated to a new list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The stdin now contains t-1 test cases, each test case containing an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
