Output State: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-1 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7)**

The first line of the code reads an integer from stdin and assigns it to the variable `n`. Since `t` is an integer between 1 and 5000, and each test case contains an integer `n` followed by 2n integers, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 50. 

The second line reads a list of 2n integers from stdin and assigns it to the variable `A`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, the list `A` will contain between 2 and 100 integers, each between 1 and 10^7.

After executing the code, the value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the value read from stdin, and the list `A` is created with the values read from stdin. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, each containing an integer `n` followed by 2n integers.
