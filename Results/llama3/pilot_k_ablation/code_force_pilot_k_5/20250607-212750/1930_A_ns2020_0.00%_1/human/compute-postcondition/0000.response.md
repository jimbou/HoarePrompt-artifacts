The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000) followed by `t` test cases. After the code is executed, the value of `t` is assigned the integer from the input, and the stdin now contains `t` test cases. Each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**
