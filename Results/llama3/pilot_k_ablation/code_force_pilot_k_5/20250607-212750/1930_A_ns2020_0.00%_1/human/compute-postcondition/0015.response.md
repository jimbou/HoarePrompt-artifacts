Output State: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 4997), n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-3 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now an integer between 1 and 4997. The values of n and A remain the same. The stdin now contains t-3 test cases, each test case containing an integer n and 2n integers. The sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has already been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is still being printed.
