Based on the precondition, the code `print(sum(A[::2]))` will print the sum of all elements at even indices of the list `A`.

Since `A` is a list of `2n` integers, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50, the list `A` has an even number of elements. The slice `A[::2]` selects every other element starting from the first element (index 0), which means it selects all elements at even indices.

The `sum` function then calculates the sum of these selected elements.

Therefore, the output will be the sum of all elements at even indices of the list `A`.

Output: **sum of all elements at even indices of the list A**
