Output State: **`t` is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4999), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and stdin remain unchanged. The range of `t` has been updated to reflect the new value.
