Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by 2n integers. It then calculates and prints the sum of the integers at even indices (0-based indexing) for each test case. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been consumed, at which point it terminates.**
