Output State: **t is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 4997) and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).**

The code executes two lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` was an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), it remains an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50). The second line assigns a list of 2n integers to `A`. Since `A` was a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), it remains a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7). The sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed.
