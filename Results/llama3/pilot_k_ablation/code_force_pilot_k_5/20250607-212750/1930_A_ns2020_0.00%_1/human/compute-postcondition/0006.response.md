The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4999), So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 4999), `n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `A` is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A is being printed.**
