The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), which means `t` is already not equal to 0, so no adjustment is needed.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 5000), stdin contains `t` test cases, each test case contains an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers `a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n}` (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7)**
