Output State: **t is an integer (0 ≤ t ≤ 4995) and t currently must be greater than 0, n is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), A is a list of 2n integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), stdin contains t-4 test cases, each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) followed by 2n integers a_1,a_2,...,a_{2n} (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7), and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 4995 (inclusive) and is still greater than 0. The values of n and A remain the same, as they were not affected by the code. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases, each with an integer n and 2n integers, as one test case has been processed. The sum of all elements at even indices of the list A has been printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed, and the sum of all elements at even indices of the list A which is sum(A[::2]) is being printed.
