Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue lies in the line `print(sum(A[::2]))`. This line assumes that the smallest numbers will always be at even indices in the sorted array, which is not necessarily true. 

For example, consider the input `n = 2` and `A = [3, 1, 1, 2]`. The program will output `4` (which is `3 + 1`), but the correct output should be `3` (which is `1 + 2`). 

To correctly solve the problem, the array should be sorted in ascending order, and then the sum of the smallest `n` numbers should be calculated. The correct code should look like this:

```python
def func():
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        n = int(input())
        A = list(map(int, input().split()))
        A.sort()
        print(sum(A[:n]))
        t = t - 1
```
