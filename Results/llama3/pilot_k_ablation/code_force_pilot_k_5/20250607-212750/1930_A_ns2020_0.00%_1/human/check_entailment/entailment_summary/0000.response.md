Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the maximum final score that can be achieved by performing n moves, where each move involves choosing two integers x and y from the whiteboard, adding the minimum of x and y to the score, and erasing x and y from the whiteboard.

The given program sorts the input list in ascending order and then calculates the sum of the integers at even indices (0-based indexing). This approach ensures that the minimum of each pair of integers is added to the score, which is the optimal strategy to achieve the maximum final score.

The program correctly implements this strategy and produces the expected output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
