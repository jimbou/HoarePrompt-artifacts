Reasoning:  
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to calculate the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program handles all the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description. The use of the modular multiplicative inverse in function func_1 is also correct, as it ensures that the result is calculated modulo 10^9 + 7. The program also correctly handles the cases where the last element of L is not equal to the first element of R, or the first element of L is not 1, or the last element of R is not N. In these cases, the program correctly returns 0. The program also correctly handles the cases where M1 is greater than 1 and M2 is greater than 1, and the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. In these cases, the program correctly calculates the result by multiplying the initial value of 'ans' with a series of numbers from (N - R[0] - 1) to 1, each multiplied by the modulus 'MOD'. 

Correctness: **True**
