Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. 

Function `func_1` calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of a product of factorials, which is used to calculate the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions. 

Function `func_2` takes the input values and checks if the last element of the prefix maximums is equal to the first element of the suffix maximums, and if the first element of the prefix maximums is 1 and the last element of the suffix maximums is N. If any of these conditions are not met, it returns 0. 

If the conditions are met, it calculates the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions by iterating from the second last element of the prefix maximums to 1 and multiplying the result of `func_1(N-1, L[-1]-1)` with the numbers from `L[-1]-2` to 1, each multiplied by the modulus MOD. It also iterates from `R[0]+1` to N and multiplies the result with the numbers from `N-R[0]-1` to 1, each multiplied by the modulus MOD. 

The final result is returned, which is a positive integer representing the number of permutations that satisfy the given conditions. 

The program correctly implements the problem description and the execution summaries of its functions, and it should produce the correct output for the given input.
