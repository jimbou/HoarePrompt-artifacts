Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to correctly solve the problem of counting the number of different permutations that could have been guessed based on the given indices of prefix maximums and suffix maximums. The program uses two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, to calculate the number of permutations.

`func_1` calculates the number of permutations for a given range of numbers, and `func_2` uses this function to calculate the total number of permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

The program correctly handles the cases where the prefix and suffix maximums do not overlap, and where they do overlap. It also correctly handles the cases where the prefix or suffix maximums are not at the beginning or end of the permutation.

The program uses modular arithmetic to avoid overflow, which is necessary because the number of permutations can be very large.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work correctly. The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement, and it correctly handles all the edge cases.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
