The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 5 and i must be greater than 0. i being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to i must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers and L[-1] must be greater than 5, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is an integer, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 6, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 5 and i must be greater than 1. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to L[cur], then the state of the variables remains the same. Otherwise, ans is updated to be equal to ans * (L[-1] - 5) % MOD.**
