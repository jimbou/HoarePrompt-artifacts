Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers and L[-1] must be greater or equal to 3, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is an integer, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 4, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 3 and i must be greater than 0, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**

In this output state, the values of `nums_left` and `i` have been decremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables, such as the last element of L being equal to the first element of R, and the first element of L being 1 and the last element of R being N, are still valid.
