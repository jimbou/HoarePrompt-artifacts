Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `M2` is a positive integer, `L` is a list of positive integers and `L[-1]` must be greater than 4, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD`, `cur` is an integer, `nums_left` is a positive integer equal to `L[-1] - 4`, `i` is a positive integer equal to `L[-1] - 3` and `i` must be greater than 1, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. Either `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `ans` with `nums_left` (which is equal to `L[-1] - 4`) and taking the modulus with `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
