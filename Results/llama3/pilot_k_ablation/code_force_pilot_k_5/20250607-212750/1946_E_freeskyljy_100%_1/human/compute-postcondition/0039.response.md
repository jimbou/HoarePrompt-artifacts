Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers and L[-1] must be greater than 5, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, cur is an integer, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 7, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 6 and i must be greater than 0. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**

The code snippet decreases `nums_left` by 1 and `i` by 1. Since `nums_left` was initially equal to `L[-1] - 6`, it becomes `L[-1] - 7`. Similarly, since `i` was initially equal to `L[-1] - 5`, it becomes `L[-1] - 6`. All other variables remain unchanged.
