Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of positive integers, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `ans * (N - R[0] - 5) % MOD`, `cur` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 5`, `i` is either `R[1] + 4` or 4 if `M1` is greater than 1 and `i` is less than `N`, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. The second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, if `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, `cur` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 5) % MOD`, which is a positive integer. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions regarding the relationships between `i`, `R[cur]`, and `cur` are still valid.
