Postcondition: **N, M1, and M2 are positive integers assigned from the first line of stdin, L is a list of positive integers assigned from the second line of stdin, R is a list of positive integers assigned from the third line of stdin, MOD is a positive integer, and func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The current value of L's first element is not equal to 1 or the current value of R's last element is not equal to N.**
