Postcondition: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers and L[-1] must be greater than 4, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer. If i is equal to L[cur], then cur is an integer equal to L[-1] - 4, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 4, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 3 and i must be greater than 1. Otherwise, ans is a positive integer equal to ans * (L[-1] - 4) % MOD, cur is an integer, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 4, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 3 and i must be greater than 1. In both cases, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**
