Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[1]` + 2 or `N` is greater than 2 if `M1` is greater than 1, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of positive integers, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer, `cur` is either 2, 3 or 4, `nums_left` is `N` - `R[0]` - 3, `i` is either `R[1]` + 2 or 2 if `M1` is greater than 1 and `i` is less than `N`, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. The second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `ans` * (`N` - `R[0]` - 1) % `MOD` or `ans` * (`N` - `R[0]` - 2) % `MOD` and `cur` is 1.**

The code increments the value of `cur` by 1. The value of `cur` was either 1, 2 or 3, so now it is either 2, 3 or 4. The values of the other variables are not affected.
