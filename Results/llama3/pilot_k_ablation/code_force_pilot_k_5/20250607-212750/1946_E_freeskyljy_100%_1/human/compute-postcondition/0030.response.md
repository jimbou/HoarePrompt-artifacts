According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is a positive integer equal to `L[-1] - 4` and `i` must be greater than 0. Since `i` is equal to `L[-1] - 4`, `L[-1]` must be greater than 4 for `i` to be greater than 0. However, this does not ensure that `i` is greater than 1. Therefore, `L[-1]` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 5.

State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers and L[-1] must be greater than 5, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is an integer, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 5, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 4 and i must be greater than 1. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**
