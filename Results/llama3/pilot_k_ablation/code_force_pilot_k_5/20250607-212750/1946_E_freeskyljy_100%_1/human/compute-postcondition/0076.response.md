Functionality: **This function takes as input two lists of positive integers, L and R, and three positive integers, N, M1, and M2, and a modulus MOD. It also uses a function func_1 that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer. The function checks if the last element of L is equal to the first element of R, the first element of L is 1, and the last element of R is N. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns 0. If M1 is greater than 1, it iterates from the second last element of L to 1 and multiplies the result of func_1(N-1, L[-1]-1) with the numbers from L[-1]-2 to 1, each multiplied by the modulus MOD. If M2 is greater than 1, it iterates from R[0]+1 to N and multiplies the result with the numbers from N-R[0]-1 to 1, each multiplied by the modulus MOD. The function returns the final result, which is a positive integer.**
