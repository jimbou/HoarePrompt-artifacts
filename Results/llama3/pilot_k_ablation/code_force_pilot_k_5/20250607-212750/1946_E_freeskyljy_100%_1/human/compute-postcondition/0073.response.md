Postcondition: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is an integer, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M2 is greater than 1, then the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R and ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 4) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 5) % MOD or ... or ans * (N - R[0] - (N - R[0] - 1)) % MOD. If M2 is not greater than 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
