Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `M2` is a positive integer, `L` is a list of positive integers and `L[-1]` must be greater or equal to 3, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `ans * (L[-1] - 3) % MOD`, `cur` is an integer, `nums_left` is a positive integer equal to `L[-1] - 3`, `i` is a positive integer equal to `L[-1] - 2` and `i` must be greater than 1, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. Either `M2` is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `i` is equal to `L[cur]`, then `cur` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `ans` is updated to `(func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1) * (L[-1] - 2)) % MOD.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of the original `ans` and `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged.
