Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is 1, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, i is R[0] + 1, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is greater than 1, then i is 0. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**
