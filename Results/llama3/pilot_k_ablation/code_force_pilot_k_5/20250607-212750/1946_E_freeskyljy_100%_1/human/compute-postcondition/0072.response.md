Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is a positive integer, nums_left is 0, i is N, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 4) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 5) % MOD or ... or ans * (N - R[0] - (N - R[0] - 1)) % MOD.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables N, M1, M2, L, R, MOD, func_1, and stdin remain unchanged. The variable cur is a positive integer, and the variable nums_left is 0. The variable i is equal to N. The variable ans is a positive integer and is equal to the product of the initial value of ans and the product of all the numbers from N - R[0] - 1 down to 0, taken modulo MOD.
