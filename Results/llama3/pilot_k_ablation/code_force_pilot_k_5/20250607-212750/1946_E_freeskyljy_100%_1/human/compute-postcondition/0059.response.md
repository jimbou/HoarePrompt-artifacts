Output State: **`N` is a positive integer greater than `R[1]` + 2 or `N` is greater than 2 if `M1` is greater than 1, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of positive integers, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD`, `cur` is either 1, 2 or 3, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 3`, `i` is either `R[1]` + 2 or 2 if `M1` is greater than 1 and `i` is less than `N`, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. The second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2 or 3. Otherwise, `cur` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the product of the original `ans` and `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables are still valid, including the constraints on `N`, `M1`, `M2`, `L`, `R`, `MOD`, `func_1`, `cur`, `nums_left`, `i`, and the relationships between `L` and `R`.
