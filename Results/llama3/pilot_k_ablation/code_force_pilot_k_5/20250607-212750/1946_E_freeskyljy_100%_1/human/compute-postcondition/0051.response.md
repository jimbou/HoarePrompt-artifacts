Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1 or 2, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2, i is either R[1] + 1 or 1 if M1 is greater than 1, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2. Otherwise, ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD and cur is 1.**

In this final state, `nums_left` has been decremented by 1, and `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `cur` and `ans` may have changed depending on the new value of `i`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2; otherwise, `ans` is updated to `ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD` and `cur` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
