Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of positive integers, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD`, `cur` is either 1 or 2, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 2`, `i` is either `R[1] + 1` or 1 if `M1` is greater than 1 and `i` is less than `N`, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. The second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. If `i` is equal to `R[cur]`, then `cur` is 2. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD` and `cur` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables retain their initial values except for `ans`, which is updated to be the product of its previous value and `nums_left` modulo `MOD`. The relationship between `i` and `cur` remains the same, and the properties of the lists `L` and `R` are unchanged.
