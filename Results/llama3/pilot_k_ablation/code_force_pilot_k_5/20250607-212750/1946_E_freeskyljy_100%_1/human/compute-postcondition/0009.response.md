Postcondition: ***N, M1, and M2 are positive integers assigned from the first line of stdin, L is a list of positive integers assigned from the second line of stdin, R is a list of positive integers assigned from the third line of stdin, MOD is a positive integer, and func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M1 is less than or equal to 1, or M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.***
