The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i.  If i is greater than 1, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 1, So for the loop to  executed the first time time L[-1] needed to have been equal or greater than 3 and i currently must be greater than 1.
State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers and L[-1] must be greater or equal to 3, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer equal to the result of func_1(N - 1, L[-1] - 1), cur is an integer equal to M1 - 2, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 2, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 1 and i must be greater than 1, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**
