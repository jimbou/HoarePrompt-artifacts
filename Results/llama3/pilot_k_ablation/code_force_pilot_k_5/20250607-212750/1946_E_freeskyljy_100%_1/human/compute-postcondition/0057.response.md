According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either `R[1] + 2` or `2` if `M1` is greater than `1` and `i` is less than `N`, and `N` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `N`, so `N` must be greater than `R[1] + 2` or `N` must be greater than `2` if `M1` is greater than `1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is a positive integer greater than R[1] + 2 or N is greater than 2 if M1 is greater than 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1, 2 or 3, nums_left is N - R[0] - 3, i is either R[1] + 2 or 2 if M1 is greater than 1 and i is less than N, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 or 3. Otherwise, ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD and cur is 1.**
