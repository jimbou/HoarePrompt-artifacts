Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of positive integers, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer, `cur` is 2, `nums_left` is `N` - `R[0]` - 1, `i` is `R[1]` or 0 if `M1` is greater than 1, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. The second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`. The current value of `i` is equal to the current value of `R[cur]`.**

In this output state, the value of `cur` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The value of `i` is now equal to the second element of `R`, or 0 if `M1` is greater than 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
