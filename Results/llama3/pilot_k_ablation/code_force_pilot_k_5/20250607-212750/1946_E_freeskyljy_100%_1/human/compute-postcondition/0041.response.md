Postcondition: ***N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is an integer, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is greater than 1, then nums_left is 0 and i is 0. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.***
