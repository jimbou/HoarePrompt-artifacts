Output State: **N is a positive integer greater than R[1] + 2 or N is greater than 2 if M1 is greater than 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, nums_left is N - R[0] - 4, i is either R[1] + 3 or 3 if M1 is greater than 1 and i is less than N, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 or 3. Otherwise, if i is not equal to R[cur], ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD and cur is 1. If i is not equal to R[cur], ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD.**

The code decrements `nums_left` by 1 and increments `i` by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions and relationships between variables that were true before the code execution remain valid, with the only changes being the updated values of `nums_left` and `i`.
