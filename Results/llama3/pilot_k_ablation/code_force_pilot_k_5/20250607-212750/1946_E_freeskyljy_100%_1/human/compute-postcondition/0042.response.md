Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is an integer, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is greater than 1, then i is 0. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**

In this output state, the value of `nums_left` is calculated as `N - R[0] - 1`, where `N` is a positive integer and `R[0]` is the first element of the list `R`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true in the initial state are still valid. Note that `i` is only 0 if `M1` is greater than 1, as specified in the initial state.
