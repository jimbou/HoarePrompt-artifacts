Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is 1, nums_left is N - R[0] - 1, i is R[0] + 1, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. If M1 is greater than 1, then i is 0. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.
Code of the loop:
while i < N:
    if i == R[cur]:
        cur += 1
    else:
        ans = ans * nums_left % MOD
    nums_left -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1 or 2, nums_left is N - R[0] - 2, i is either R[1] + 1 or 1 if M1 is greater than 1, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2. Otherwise, ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD and cur is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1, 2 or 3, nums_left is N - R[0] - 3, i is either R[1] + 2 or 2 if M1 is greater than 1 and i is less than N, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 or 3. Otherwise, ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD and cur is 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: N is a positive integer greater than R[1] + 2 or N is greater than 2 if M1 is greater than 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, nums_left is N - R[0] - 4, i is either R[1] + 3 or 3 if M1 is greater than 1 and i is less than N, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 or 3. Otherwise, if i is not equal to R[cur], ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD and cur is 1. If i is not equal to R[cur], ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: N is a positive integer greater than R[1] + 3 or N is greater than 3 if M1 is greater than 1, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, nums_left is N - R[0] - 5, i is either R[1] + 4 or 4 if M1 is greater than 1 and i is less than N, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 or 3. Otherwise, if i is not equal to R[cur], ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD and cur is 1. If i is not equal to R[cur], ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD. If i is equal to R[cur], ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 4) % MOD.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: N is a positive integer greater than i, M1 is a positive integer, M2 is a positive integer greater than 1, L is a list of positive integers, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, nums_left is N - R[0] - 6, i is either R[1] + 5 or 5 if M1 is greater than 1 and i is less than N, stdin is empty. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. The second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R. If i is equal to R[cur], then cur is 2 or 3 and ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 4) % MOD. If i is not equal to R[cur], then cur is 1 and ans is equal to ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 2) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 3) % MOD or ans * (N - R[0] - 5) % MOD.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
