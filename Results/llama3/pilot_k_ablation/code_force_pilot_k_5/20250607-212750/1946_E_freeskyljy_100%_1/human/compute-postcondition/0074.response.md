Output State: **The program returns a positive integer 'ans' which is the result of multiplying the initial value of 'ans' with a series of numbers from (N - R[0] - 1) to 1, each multiplied by the modulus 'MOD', if M2 is greater than 1. If M2 is not greater than 1, the program returns the initial value of 'ans'.**
