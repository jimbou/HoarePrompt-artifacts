Output State: **N is a positive integer, M1 is a positive integer greater than 1, M2 is a positive integer, L is a list of positive integers and L[-1] must be greater than 5, R is a list of positive integers, MOD is a positive integer, func_1 is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, ans is a positive integer, cur is an integer equal to L[-1] - 5, nums_left is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 5, i is a positive integer equal to L[-1] - 4 and i must be greater than 1. The last element of L is equal to the first element of R. The first element of L is 1 and the last element of R is N. Either M2 is less than or equal to 1, or the second last element of L is not equal to the second element of R.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `cur` has been decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
