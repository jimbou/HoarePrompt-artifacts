Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `M1` is a positive integer, `M2` is a positive integer greater than 1, `L` is a list of positive integers, `R` is a list of positive integers, `MOD` is a positive integer, `func_1` is a function that takes two positive integers as input and returns a positive integer, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `ans * (N - R[0] - 1) % MOD`, `cur` is 1, `nums_left` is `N - R[0] - 1`, `i` is not equal to `R[cur]`, stdin is empty. The last element of `L` is equal to the first element of `R`. The first element of `L` is 1 and the last element of `R` is `N`. The second last element of `L` is not equal to the second element of `R`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the result of multiplying the previous value of `ans` by `nums_left` (which is `N - R[0] - 1`) and taking the modulus `MOD`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
