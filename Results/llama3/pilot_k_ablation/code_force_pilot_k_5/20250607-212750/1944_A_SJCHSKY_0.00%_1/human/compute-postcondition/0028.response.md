Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: The value of qs remains a positive integer greater than 1, n remains an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k, and _ remains 1. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.
