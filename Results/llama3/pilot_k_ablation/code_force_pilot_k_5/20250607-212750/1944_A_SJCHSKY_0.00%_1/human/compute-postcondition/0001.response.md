To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `qs` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't affect the loop execution). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `qs`. If `qs` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `qs` is a positive integer, which means it is already at least 1, so no adjustment is needed for `qs`. However, we can adjust the state of `_` to be 0, since it will be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`qs` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2, `_` is 0**
