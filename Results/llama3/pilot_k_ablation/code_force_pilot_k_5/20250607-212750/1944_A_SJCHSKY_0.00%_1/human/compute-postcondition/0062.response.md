Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, reachable_count is equal to n, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five**

In this output state, the value of `qs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is updated to be equal to the first integer from the input, and the value of `k` is updated to be equal to the second integer from the input. The value of `reachable_count` is updated to be equal to the value of `n`. The value of `_` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus five, as five inputs have been consumed by the code.
