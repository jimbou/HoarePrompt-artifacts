Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 0 and n-1, reachable_count is equal to n-1, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**

The code block modifies the values of `k` and `reachable_count`. The first line decrements `k` by the difference between `reachable_count` and 1, effectively subtracting `n-1` from `k`. Since `k` was initially between 1 and `n`, it is now between 0 and `n-1`. The second line decrements `reachable_count` by 1, making it equal to `n-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
