To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `k` and `reachable_count` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k >= reachable_count - 1` and `k > 0`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` and greater than 0, and `reachable_count` is less than or equal to `k - 2`.

To guarantee the loop can execute again, we need to ensure that `k` is still greater than 0 and that `reachable_count` is less than or equal to `k - 1` (since `k` must be greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1`).

Therefore, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `k` must be greater than 0 (no change needed)
* `reachable_count` must be less than or equal to `k - 1` (instead of `k - 2`)

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`qs` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n-1` and greater than 0, `reachable_count` is less than or equal to `k - 1`, `_` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three**
