The variables in the loop head are k and reachable_count, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables k and reachable_count. If k is greater than or equal to reachable_count - 1 and k is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is an integer between 1 and n-1 and greater than 0, reachable_count is less than or equal to k - 2. For the loop to execute one more time, reachable_count must be less than or equal to k - 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 1 and n-1 and greater than 0, reachable_count is less than or equal to k - 3, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
