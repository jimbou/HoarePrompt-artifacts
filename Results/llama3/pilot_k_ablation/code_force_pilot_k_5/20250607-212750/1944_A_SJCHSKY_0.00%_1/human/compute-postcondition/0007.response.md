The variables in the loop head are k and reachable_count, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables k and reachable_count. If k is greater than or equal to reachable_count - 1 and k is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is at least n - 2 and less than or equal to n * (n - 1) / 2, reachable_count is equal to n - 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, k must be greater than or equal to n - 3 and greater than 0. Also, reachable_count must be less than or equal to n - 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **qs is a positive integer, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, k is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to n - 3 and less than or equal to n * (n - 1) / 2, reachable_count is less than or equal to n - 3, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
