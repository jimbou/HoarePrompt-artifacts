Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k and less than or equal to 1, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k and less than or equal to 1, _ is 4, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus five.
