According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `reachable_count`. If `k` is greater than or equal to `reachable_count - 1` and `k` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `n - 3` and less than or equal to `n * (n - 1) / 2 minus reachable_count plus 1`, `reachable_count` is less than or equal to `n - 3 minus 1`. `k` being greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `reachable_count`. `reachable_count` being less than or equal to `n - 3 minus 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `reachable_count` is less than or equal to `n - 3 minus 1` and `reachable_count` is less than `k plus 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`qs` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `k` is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to `reachable_count`, `reachable_count` is less than or equal to `n - 3 minus 1` and `reachable_count` is less than `k plus 1`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
