Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus reachable_count, reachable_count is less than or equal to k - 1 and less than or equal to k and equal to its original value minus 2, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five**

In this final state, the value of `k` has been decremented by the value of `reachable_count` minus 1, and the value of `reachable_count` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
