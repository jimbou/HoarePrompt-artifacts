Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `qs` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two integers n and k such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 0 <= k <= n * (n - 1) / 2.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(qs):
    n, k = [int(num) for num in input().split()]
    reachable_count = n
    while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
        k -= reachable_count - 1
        reachable_count -= 1
    print(reachable_count)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: qs is a positive integer, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, k is greater than or equal to 0 and less than reachable_count, reachable_count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to n, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the reachable_count which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to n is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and the value of reachable_count which is less than or equal to k is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is greater than 1, k is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is greater than or equal to 1, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and the reachable_count which is greater than or equal to 1 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: qs is a positive integer greater than 3, n is greater than 1 and equal to the first integer from the input, k is equal to 0, reachable_count is less than or equal to 0, _ is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the value of reachable_count which is less than or equal to 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k and less than or equal to 1, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, and reachable_count which is less than or equal to k and less than or equal to 1 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
