Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 3, n is greater than 1 and equal to the first integer from the input, k is equal to 0, reachable_count is less than or equal to 0, _ is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four**

The loop will continue to execute until k is less than or equal to 0 or reachable_count is less than or equal to 0. At this point, the loop will terminate, and the output state will be as described above.
