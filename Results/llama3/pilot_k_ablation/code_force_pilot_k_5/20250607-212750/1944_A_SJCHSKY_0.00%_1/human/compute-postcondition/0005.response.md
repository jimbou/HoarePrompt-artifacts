To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `k` and `reachable_count`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `k >= reachable_count - 1` and `k > 0`.

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least `n - 2` and less than or equal to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, and `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `k` to be at least `n - 1` (since `reachable_count` is `n - 1`), and also ensure that `k` is greater than 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`qs` is a positive integer, `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, `k` is at least `n - 1` and less than or equal to `n * (n - 1) / 2`, `reachable_count` is equal to `n - 1`, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one**
