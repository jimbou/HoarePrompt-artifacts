Output State: **qs is a positive integer, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, k is at least n - 2 and less than or equal to n * (n - 1) / 2, reachable_count is equal to n - 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been reduced by `reachable_count - 1`, which is `n - 1`, making it at least `n - 2` and at most `n * (n - 1) / 2`. The value of `reachable_count` has been decremented by 1, making it equal to `n - 1`. The values of `qs`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus one.
