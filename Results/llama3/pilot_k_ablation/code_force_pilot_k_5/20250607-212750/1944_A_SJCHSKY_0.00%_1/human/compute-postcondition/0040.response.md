Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is greater than 1, k is greater than 0, reachable_count is less than or equal to k+1 and is equal to its original value minus 4, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**

In this output state, the values of `qs`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `k` is reduced by the value of `reachable_count - 1`, ensuring that `k` remains greater than 0. The value of `reachable_count` is decremented by 1, making it equal to its original value minus 4. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, as the code does not modify it.
