Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 3, n is greater than 1 and equal to the first integer from the input, k is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n-1 and equal to the second integer from the input, reachable_count is equal to n, _ is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four**

The code first reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. The second line sets `reachable_count` to the value of `n`. The value of `qs` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged. The input in `stdin` is reduced by one test case.
