Output State: **qs is a positive integer, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, k is greater than 0 and greater than or equal to n - 3 and less than or equal to n * (n - 1) / 2 minus reachable_count plus 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to n - 3 minus 1, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `reachable_count`. The first line decrements `k` by the value of `reachable_count` minus 1, effectively reducing `k` by the value of `reachable_count` and then adding 1. The second line decrements `reachable_count` by 1. The values of `qs`, `n`, and `_` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, as no input operations are performed.
