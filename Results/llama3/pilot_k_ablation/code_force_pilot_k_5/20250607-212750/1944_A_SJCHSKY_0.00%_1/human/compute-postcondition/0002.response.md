Output State: **qs is a positive integer, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 0 and n * (n - 1) / 2, reachable_count is equal to n, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. The value of `n` is between 1 and 100, and the value of `k` is between 0 and `n * (n - 1) / 2`. The variable `reachable_count` is assigned the value of `n`. The variable `qs` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The variable `_` remains unchanged as 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
