The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `qs`. If `_` is less than `qs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, `qs` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `qs` must be greater than 4.
State: **`qs` is a positive integer greater than 4, `n` is greater than 1 and equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is equal to 0, `reachable_count` is less than or equal to 0, `_` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, and the value of `reachable_count` which is less than or equal to 0 is being printed**
