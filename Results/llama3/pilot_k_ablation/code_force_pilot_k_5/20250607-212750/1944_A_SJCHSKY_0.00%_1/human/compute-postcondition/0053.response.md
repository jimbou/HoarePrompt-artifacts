The code snippet modifies the values of `k` and `reachable_count`. The first line decrements `k` by the value of `reachable_count` minus 1. Since `reachable_count` is equal to `n-3`, and `n` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 5, `reachable_count` is between -2 and 2. Therefore, `k` becomes 1 minus `reachable_count` plus 1, which is 2 minus `reachable_count`. The second line decrements `reachable_count` by 1, making it `n-4`.

Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 3, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 5, k is 2 minus (n-3), reachable_count is n-4, _ is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four**
