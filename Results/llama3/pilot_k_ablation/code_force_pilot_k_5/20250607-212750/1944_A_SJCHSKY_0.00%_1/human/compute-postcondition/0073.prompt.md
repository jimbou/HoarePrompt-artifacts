Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, reachable_count is equal to n, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five
Code of the loop:
while k >= reachable_count - 1 and k > 0:
    k -= reachable_count - 1
    reachable_count -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to n - 1, reachable_count is equal to n - 1, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to n - 1 - reachable_count + 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k + 1 and is one less than its original value, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to n - 1 - reachable_count + 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, k is decreased by reachable_count - 1, reachable_count is decreased by 1
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus reachable_count plus 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k - 1 and less than or equal to k and equal to its original value minus 1, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to its original value minus reachable_count, reachable_count is less than or equal to k - 1 and less than or equal to k and equal to its original value minus 2, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
