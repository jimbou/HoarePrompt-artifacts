The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `qs`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `qs`. If `_` is less than `qs`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `qs` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `qs` must be greater than 3.
State: **`qs` is a positive integer greater than 3, `n` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `n-1`, `reachable_count` is greater than or equal to 1, `_` is 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, and the `reachable_count` which is greater than or equal to 1 is being printed**
