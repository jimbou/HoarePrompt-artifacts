Output State: **qs is a positive integer, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, k is greater than or equal to 0 and less than reachable_count, reachable_count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to n, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `qs` remains a positive integer, `n` remains between 1 and 100, `k` is non-negative and less than `reachable_count`, `reachable_count` is greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n`, and the value of `_` remains 0. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing multiple test cases minus one.
