Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 1 and n-1 and greater than 0, reachable_count is less than or equal to k - 2, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been reduced by the difference between `reachable_count` and 1, and `reachable_count` has been decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
