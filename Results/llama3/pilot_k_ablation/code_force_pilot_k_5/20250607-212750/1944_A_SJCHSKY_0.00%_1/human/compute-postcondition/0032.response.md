Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is equal to n, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `k` has been updated to the values read from the input. The value of `reachable_count` has been set to `n`. The value of `qs`, `_` and stdin remains unchanged.
