Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to n - 1, reachable_count is equal to n - 1, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five**

The code block modifies the values of `k` and `reachable_count`. The first line decrements `k` by the difference between `reachable_count` and 1, which is equivalent to `n - 1`. Since `k` is initially greater than or equal to `n - 1`, this operation makes `k` equal to `n - 1`. The second line decrements `reachable_count` by 1, making it equal to `n - 1`. No other variables are affected.
