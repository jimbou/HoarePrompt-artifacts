Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 0 and n, reachable_count is equal to n, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**.

The code block reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k, respectively. The value of n is between 1 and 100, and the value of k is between 0 and n. The reachable_count is set to the value of n. The variable qs, _, and stdin are not affected by the code block.
