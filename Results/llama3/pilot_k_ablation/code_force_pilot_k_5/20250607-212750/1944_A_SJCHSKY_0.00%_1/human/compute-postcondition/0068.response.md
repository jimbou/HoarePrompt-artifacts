Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 4, n is an integer, k is an integer greater than 0 and equal to n - 1 - reachable_count + 1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k, _ is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus five, k is decreased by reachable_count - 1, reachable_count is decreased by 1**

The code modifies the values of `k` and `reachable_count`. The first line decreases `k` by `reachable_count - 1`, and the second line decreases `reachable_count` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
