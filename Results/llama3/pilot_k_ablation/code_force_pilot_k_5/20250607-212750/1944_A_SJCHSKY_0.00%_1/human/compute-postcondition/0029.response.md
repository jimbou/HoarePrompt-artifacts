The code prints the value of `reachable_count`, which is less than or equal to `k`. Since the exact value of `reachable_count` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated `reachable_count`.
Output: **reachable_count (where reachable_count is less than or equal to k)**
