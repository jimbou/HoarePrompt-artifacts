Output State: **qs is a positive integer, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, k is at least n - 2 and less than or equal to n * (n - 1) / 2, reachable_count is equal to n - 2, _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been reduced by 1, and the value of `reachable_count` has been reduced by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
