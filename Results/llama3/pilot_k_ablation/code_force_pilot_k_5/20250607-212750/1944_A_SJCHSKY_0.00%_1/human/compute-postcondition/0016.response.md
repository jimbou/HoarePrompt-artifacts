The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and qs, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than qs, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, qs is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again qs must be greater than 1.
State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 100, k is greater than or equal to 0 and less than reachable_count, reachable_count is greater than 0 and less than or equal to n, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the reachable_count which is greater than 0 and less than or equal to n is being printed**
