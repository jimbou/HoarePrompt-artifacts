The code snippet provided modifies the values of `k` and `reachable_count`. The first line decrements `k` by the value of `reachable_count` minus 1. Since `reachable_count` is less than or equal to `k - 3`, this operation will decrease `k` but keep it greater than or equal to 2. The second line decrements `reachable_count` by 1, making it less than or equal to `k - 4`.

Output State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 1, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k - 4, _ is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**
