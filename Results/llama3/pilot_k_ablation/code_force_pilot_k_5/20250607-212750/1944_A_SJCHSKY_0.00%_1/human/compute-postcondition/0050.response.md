The variables in the loop head are k and reachable_count, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables k and reachable_count. If k is greater than or equal to reachable_count - 1 and k is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is greater than 0 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is equal to n-1. For the loop to be executed one more time k needed to have been equal to n-1 and reachable_count needed to have been equal to n-2.
State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 3, n is greater than 1 and less than or equal to k + 1, k is equal to n-1, reachable_count is equal to n-2, _ is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four**
