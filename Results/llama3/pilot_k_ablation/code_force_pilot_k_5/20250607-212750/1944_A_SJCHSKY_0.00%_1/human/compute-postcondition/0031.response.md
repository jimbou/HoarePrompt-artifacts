The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than qs, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, qs is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 2 and for the loop to execute again qs must be greater than 2.
State: **qs is a positive integer greater than 2, n is an integer between 1 and 100, k is an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to n-1, reachable_count is less than or equal to k, _ is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and the value of reachable_count which is less than or equal to k is being printed**
