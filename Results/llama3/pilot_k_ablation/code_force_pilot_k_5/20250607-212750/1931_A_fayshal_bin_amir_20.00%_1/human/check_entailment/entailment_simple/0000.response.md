Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding the lexicographically smallest three-letter word that could have been encoded from a given integer. The program works by iterating through each test case and determining the three-letter word based on the value of the input integer.

The program correctly handles the cases where the input integer is between 3 and 26 (inclusive), 27 and 52 (inclusive), and 53 and 78 (inclusive). For each case, it constructs the three-letter word by assigning the appropriate letters to the variables 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

The program uses the chr() function to convert the integer values to their corresponding lowercase letters. The expression '96 + num' is used to calculate the ASCII value of the letter, where 'num' is the integer value between 1 and 26 (inclusive).

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the input integer is 3, in which case the output should be 'aaa'.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
