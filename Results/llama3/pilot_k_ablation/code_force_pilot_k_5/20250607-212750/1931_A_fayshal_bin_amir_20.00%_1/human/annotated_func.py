#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive).
    if (1 <= num <= 26) :
        return chr(num + 96)
        #The program returns a lowercase letter of the English alphabet that corresponds to the integer value of 'num' between 1 and 26 (inclusive), where 'num' is an integer between 3 and 78 (inclusive).
    #State: num is an integer between 27 and 78 (inclusive)

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes an integer 'num' between 3 and 78 (inclusive) as input and returns a lowercase letter of the English alphabet corresponding to the integer value of 'num' between 1 and 26 (inclusive). If 'num' is between 27 and 78 (inclusive), the function does not return any value.
