The code prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times, excluding the last character.
Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, the output will be a string of '1 ' repeated `n-1` times, followed by a single '1'.
Output: **'1 ' repeated [n] times, excluding the last character (where n is the value of n)**
