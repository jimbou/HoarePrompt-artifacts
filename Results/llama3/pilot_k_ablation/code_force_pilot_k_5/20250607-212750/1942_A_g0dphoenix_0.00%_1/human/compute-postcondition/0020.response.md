Based on the precondition, the code will print the value -1.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The initial state describes the values of `_`, `n`, and `k`, but these values are not relevant to the print statement.
* The print statement simply prints the value -1.

Therefore, the output will be the value -1, regardless of the values of `n` and `k`.

Output: **-1**
