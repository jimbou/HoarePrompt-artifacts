Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the integers read from the input, and stdin is empty since the input has been consumed. The condition that `n` is greater than 1 is still valid, as the new value of `n` is an integer greater than 1.
