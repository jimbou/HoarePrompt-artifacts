Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `('1 ' * n)`: This expression creates a string by repeating the string `'1 '` `n` times. Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, this will create a string with multiple occurrences of `'1 '`.
2. `[:-1]`: This is a slice notation that removes the last character from the string created in step 1. Since the string ends with a space, this will remove the trailing space.

Now, let's analyze the output:

The `print` statement will print the resulting string, which is a sequence of `n` occurrences of `'1 '`, with the trailing space removed.

Since `n` is an integer greater than 1, the output will be a string with at least two occurrences of `'1 '`. For example, if `n` is 3, the output would be `'1 1 1'`.

Output: **a string of '1 ' repeated n times, without a trailing space (where n is an integer greater than 1)**
