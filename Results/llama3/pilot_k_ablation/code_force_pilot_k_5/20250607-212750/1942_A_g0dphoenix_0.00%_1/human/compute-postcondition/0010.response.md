Output State: **`_` is 1, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

Explanation:
The code `n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since the input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t-2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), after reading the first line, there are `t-1` lines left in the input. The values of `_` remain unchanged.
