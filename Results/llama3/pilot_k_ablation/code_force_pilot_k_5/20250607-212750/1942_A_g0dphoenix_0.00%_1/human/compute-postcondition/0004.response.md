Output: **_ is 0, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`, and a string of '1 ' repeated n times (without the trailing space) is being printed**
