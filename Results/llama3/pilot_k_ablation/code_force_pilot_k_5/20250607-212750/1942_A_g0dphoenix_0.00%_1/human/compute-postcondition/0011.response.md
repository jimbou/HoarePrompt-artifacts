The code prints a string consisting of `n` repetitions of the string '1 ', excluding the last space character.
Since `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), the output will be a string of `n` '1's separated by spaces, without a trailing space.
Output: **a string of n '1's separated by spaces (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
