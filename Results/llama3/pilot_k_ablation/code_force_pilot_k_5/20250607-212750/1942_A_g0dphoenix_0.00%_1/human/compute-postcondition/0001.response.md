The code accepts two integers from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). The variable `_` is 0.

The variable `n` is assigned the first integer from the input, and `k` is assigned the second integer from the input. The value of `_` is not affected.

Output State: **`_` is 0, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**
