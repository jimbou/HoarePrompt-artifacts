Output State: **`_` is 2, `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the next two integers from the input, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

In this output state, the values of `_` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `k` are updated to the next two integers from the input, which are still within the range of 1 to 10^3. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k, as one line has been consumed by the input operation.
