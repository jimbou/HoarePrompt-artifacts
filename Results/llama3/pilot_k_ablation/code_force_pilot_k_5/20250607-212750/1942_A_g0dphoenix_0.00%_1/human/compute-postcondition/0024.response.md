Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers, `n` is greater than 1, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, `n` and `k` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, where `input().split(' ')` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The value of `n` is greater than 1, as specified in the initial state. The stdin is now empty, as the input has been consumed.
