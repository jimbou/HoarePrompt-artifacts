The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and the input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is an integer greater than 0 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be an integer greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), `_` is 0**
