Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `('1 ' * n)`: This expression creates a string by repeating the string `'1 '` `n` times. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, this will create a string with `n` occurrences of `'1 '`.
2. `[:-1]`: This is a slice notation that removes the last character from the string. Since the string has `n` occurrences of `'1 '`, removing the last character will result in a string with `n-1` occurrences of `'1 '` and a single space at the end.

Now, let's describe the output:

The code prints a string consisting of `n` occurrences of the digit `'1'`, separated by spaces, with a single space at the end. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, which is assigned from the input.

Output: **a string of n '1's separated by spaces, with a single space at the end (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
