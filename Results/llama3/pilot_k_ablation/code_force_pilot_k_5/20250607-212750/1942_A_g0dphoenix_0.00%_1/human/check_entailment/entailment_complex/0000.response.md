Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly solve the problem. The problem requires finding an array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n that satisfies two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n
2. Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a, exactly k of them are sorted.

The program only checks if n equals k, and if so, it prints a string of n ones separated by spaces. However, this solution is not correct for several reasons:

*   It does not consider the case where k is less than n. In this case, the program should find an array that has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts.
*   It does not ensure that the array a_1, a_2, ..., a_n satisfies the condition 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
*   It does not handle the case where k is greater than 1 and n is greater than 2. In this case, the program should find an array that has exactly k sorted cyclic shifts, but the current solution only prints -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
