Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array that satisfies the conditions of having exactly k sorted cyclic shifts out of n total cyclic shifts. The program takes two inputs, n and k, where n is the length of the array and k is the number of sorted cyclic shifts.

The program first checks if n is equal to k. If they are equal, it prints an array of 1's of length n. This is because an array of all 1's will have all its cyclic shifts sorted, thus satisfying the condition.

However, if n is not equal to k, the program simply prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the conditions. This is incorrect because the program does not attempt to find a valid array for the case where n is not equal to k.

For example, for the input (3, 1), the program should output an array like [69420, 69, 420] which has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, but instead, it outputs -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not handle all possible cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
