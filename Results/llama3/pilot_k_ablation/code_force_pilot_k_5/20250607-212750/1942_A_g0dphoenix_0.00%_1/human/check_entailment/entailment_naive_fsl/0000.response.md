Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when n > k > 1. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program should output an array that has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts, but the program outputs -1.

The correct output for this case should be an array like [1, 1, 2] or [2, 1, 1], which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

The program only handles the cases when n = k or k = 1, but it does not handle the cases when n > k > 1. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
