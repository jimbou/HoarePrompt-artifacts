Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement requires finding an array `a` that satisfies two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n
2. Out of the n total cyclic shifts of `a`, exactly k of them are sorted.

The program only handles the case where n == k, and for this case, it prints an array of all 1's, which is correct. However, for the case where n != k, the program simply prints -1, indicating that no such array exists. This is not necessarily true.

For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, there exists an array [69,420, 69,420] that satisfies the conditions, but the program would print -1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
