Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem requires finding an array a that satisfies two conditions:

1. 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n
2. Out of the n total cyclic shifts of a, exactly k of them are sorted.

The program only checks if n equals k and prints a string of n ones separated by spaces if they are equal. However, this does not guarantee that the array a satisfies the second condition.

For example, if n = 3 and k = 1, the program will print -1, but there is a valid array a = [69420, 69, 420] that satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
