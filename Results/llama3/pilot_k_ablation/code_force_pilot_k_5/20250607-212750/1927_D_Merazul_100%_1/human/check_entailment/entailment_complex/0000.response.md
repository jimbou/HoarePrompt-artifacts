Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input from standard input, parsing the first line as an integer `t`, and then for each of the following `t` lines, it reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` integers, an integer `q`, and `q` pairs of integers.

2. The program correctly initializes the list `a` with `n+1` elements, where `a[i]` is the index of the last occurrence of the `i`-th integer in the input sequence. This is done by iterating over the input sequence and updating the index `j` whenever a new integer is encountered.

3. For each pair of integers `l` and `r`, the program correctly prints either the value of `a[r]` and `r`, or `[-1, -1]` if `a[r]` is less than `l`. This is done by checking the condition `a[r] < l` and printing the corresponding values.

4. The program correctly repeats this process `t` times, and finally, it prints the results for all pairs of integers.

5. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `l` is equal to `r`, or when `a[r]` is less than `l`.

6. The program correctly uses the lambda function `R` to read the input from standard input, and it correctly uses the `while` loop to iterate over the input sequence.

7. The program correctly uses the list `a` to store the indices of the last occurrence of each integer in the input sequence, and it correctly uses the variables `p`, `i`, and `j` to keep track of the current integer, its index, and the index of the last occurrence of the previous integer, respectively.

8. The program correctly uses the `print` function to print the results for each pair of integers, and it correctly uses the `*` operator to unpack the list `[-1, -1]` when printing the result.

Correctness: **True**
