Correctness: **True**.

Explanation:

The program is correct because it correctly implements the problem description. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the length of the array, the array itself, and the number of queries. For each query, it finds the first pair of different elements in the array within the given range and prints their indices. If no such pair exists, it prints -1 -1.

The program uses a clever trick to find the first pair of different elements. It maintains an array `a` where `a[i]` is the index of the first element that is different from the element at index `i`. This is done by iterating over the array and updating `a[i]` whenever a different element is found.

The program then uses this array to answer the queries. For each query, it checks if the index of the first different element within the range is less than the start of the range. If it is, it means that there is no pair of different elements within the range, and it prints -1 -1. Otherwise, it prints the indices of the first pair of different elements.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where the range is empty, the case where the array contains only one element, and the case where the array contains only two elements.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, and it correctly implements the problem description.
