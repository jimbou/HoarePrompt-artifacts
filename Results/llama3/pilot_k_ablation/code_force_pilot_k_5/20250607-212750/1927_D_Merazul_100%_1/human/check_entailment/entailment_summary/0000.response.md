Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. The program correctly implements the required logic to find a pair of different elements within a given range in the input array. It uses a clever approach to keep track of the last occurrence of each integer in the array, which allows it to efficiently find a pair of different elements for each query.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases, including when no pair of different elements exists within the given range. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected, producing the correct output for the provided example input.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the correctness of the program can be confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
