Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding two indices `i` and `j` in an array `a` such that `l <= i <= r`, `l <= j <= r`, and `a_i != a_j` for each query. The program uses a clever approach to preprocess the array and store the indices of the last occurrence of a different element in the array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2. The program preprocesses the array `a` by iterating through it and storing the indices of the last occurrence of a different element in the array. This is done using the `j` variable, which is updated whenever a different element is encountered.
3. The program then reads the queries and for each query, it checks if the stored index `a[r]` is less than the query's left boundary `l`. If it is, it means that there is no pair of different elements in the range `[l, r]`, and the program prints `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, it prints the stored index `a[r]` and the current index `r`.
4. The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the query's left boundary `l` is equal to the stored index `a[r]`.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
