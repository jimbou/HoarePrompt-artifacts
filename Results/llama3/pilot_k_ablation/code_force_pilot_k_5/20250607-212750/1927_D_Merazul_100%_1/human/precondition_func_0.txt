stdin contains a sequence of lines. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4). Each of the following t lines contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), then an integer q (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5), and finally q pairs of integers l and r (1 <= l < r <= n).
