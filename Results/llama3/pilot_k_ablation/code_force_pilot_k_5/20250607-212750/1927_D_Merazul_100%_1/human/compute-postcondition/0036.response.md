The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is truthy (i.e., not zero), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4. For the loop to execute one more time, t must be greater than 0.

State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is truthy, i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, q is falsy, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.**
