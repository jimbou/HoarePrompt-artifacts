Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines: each line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), then an integer q (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5), and finally q pairs of integers l and r (1 <= l < r <= n).**

The code reads the first line from stdin, which contains a single integer t, and assigns it to the variable t. The value of t is between 1 and 10^4. The remaining lines in stdin are not affected by this code snippet.
