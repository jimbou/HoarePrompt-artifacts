Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the last element in R(), i is n, j is 1 if the last element in R() is not equal to the second last element in R(), otherwise j is 0, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is a truthy value and is the last element in R() minus 1, R() has at least n-1 elements, x is the second last element in R()**

Here's a natural language description of the output state:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 0 and 10^4. The list `a` still contains `n+1` elements, with the first element being 0 and the remaining `n` elements being copies of `j`. The value of `p` is still the last element in `R()`. The value of `i` is still `n`. The value of `j` depends on the last two elements of `R()`: if they are different, `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` is 0. The values of `l` and `r` are updated to be the first and second elements of `R()`, respectively. The value of `q` is decremented by 1, but it is still a truthy value. The number of elements in `R()` is still at least `n-1`. The value of `x` is still the second last element in `R()`.
