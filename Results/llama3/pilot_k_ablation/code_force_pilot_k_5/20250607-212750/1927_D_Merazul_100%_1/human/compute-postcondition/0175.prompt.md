Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `a` is a list containing `i`+1 elements: 0 and `i`-1 elements equal to `j`, `p` is the `i`th element in `R()`, `i` is `i`, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the (`i`-1)th element in `R()`, otherwise `j` is `i`-1, `l` and `r` are the first and second elements in `R()` respectively, `q` is the first element in `R()`, `R()` has at least `i` elements, `x` is the `i`th element in `R()`
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing i+1 elements: 0 and i-1 elements equal to j, p is the ith element in R(), i is i, j is 1 if x is not equal to the (i-1)th element in R(), otherwise j is i-1, l is the first element in R(), r is the second element in R(), q is falsy, R() has at least i elements, x is the ith element in R(), and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing i+1 elements: 0 and i-1 elements equal to j, p is the ith element in R(), i is i, j is 1 if x is not equal to the (i-1)th element in R(), otherwise j is i-1, l is the first element in R(), r is the second element in R(), q is falsy, R() has at least i elements, x is the ith element in R(), and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing i+1 elements: 0 and i-1 elements equal to j, p is the ith element in R(), i is i, j is 1 if x is not equal to the (i-1)th element in R(), otherwise j is i-1, x is the ith element in R(), q is falsy, l is the first element in R(), r is the second element in R(), and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing i+1 elements: 0 and i-1 elements equal to j, p is the ith element in R(), i is i, j is 1 if x is not equal to the (i-1)th element in R(), otherwise j is i-1, x is the ith element in R(), q is falsy, l is the first element in R(), and r is the second element in R(), and this is printed: either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing i+1 elements: 0 and i-1 elements equal to j, p is the ith element in R(), i is i, j is 1 if x is not equal to the (i-1)th element in R(), otherwise j is i-1, x is the ith element in R(), q is falsy, l is the first element in R(), and r is the second element in R(), and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
