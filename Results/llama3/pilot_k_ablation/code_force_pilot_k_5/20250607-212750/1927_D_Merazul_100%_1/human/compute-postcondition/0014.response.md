Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is the last element in R(), i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R(), q is the last element in R() which is also equal to p**

In this output state, the values of t, a, i, j, stdin, and R() remain the same as in the initial state. The value of p is still the last element in R(), but since R() is empty, p is also empty. The value of x is also the last element in R(), which is empty, so x is also empty. The new variable q is assigned the value of the last element in R(), which is also equal to p.
