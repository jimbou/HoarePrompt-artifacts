The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the R(). If R() has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, R() is not empty, x is the first element in R(), p is the first element in R(), l is the last element in R(), r is the last element in R(). So for the loop to be executed one more time the R() must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second element in R(). Also, p must be the second element in R(), l is still the last element in R(), r is still the last element in R().
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 2 elements: 0 and j, p is the second element in R(), i is 1, j is either 0 or i (which is 0), stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in R(), q is falsy, l is the last element in R(), r is the last element in R() and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
