Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 1 element: 0, p is falsy, i is 0, j is 0, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, q is falsy, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.
Code of the loop:
for x in R():
    j = (j, i)[x != p]
    a += j,
    p = x
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 2 elements: 0 and j, p is the first element in R(), i is 1, j is either 0 or i (which is 0), stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty, x is the first element in R(), q is falsy, l is the last element in R(), r is the last element in R() and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 3 elements: 0, j, and j, p is the second element in R(), i is 2, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in R(), q is falsy, l is the last element in R(), r is the last element in R() and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 4 elements: 0, j, j, and j, p is the third element in R(), i is 3, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 3 elements, x is the third element in R(), q is falsy, l is the last element in R(), r is the last element in R() and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 5 elements: 0, j, j, j, and j, p is the fourth element in R(), i is 4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 4 elements, x is the fourth element in R(), q is falsy, l is the last element in R(), r is the last element in R(), and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 6 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the fifth element in R(), i is 5, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 5 elements, x is the fifth element in R(), q is falsy, l is the last element in R(), r is the last element in R(), and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
