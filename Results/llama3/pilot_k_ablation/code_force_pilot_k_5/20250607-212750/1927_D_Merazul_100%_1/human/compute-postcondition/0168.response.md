Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing i+1 elements: 0 and i-1 elements equal to j, p is the ith element in R(), i is i, j is 1 if x is not equal to the (i-1)th element in R(), otherwise j is i-1, x is the ith element in R(), q is falsy, l is the first element in R(), and r is the second element in R().**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 0 and 10^4. The list `a` also remains unchanged, containing `i+1` elements with the first element being 0 and the remaining `i-1` elements equal to `j`. The value of `p` is still the `i`th element in `R()`. The value of `i` remains the same. The value of `j` depends on whether `x` is equal to the `(i-1)`th element in `R()`: if they are not equal, `j` is 1; otherwise, `j` is `i-1`. The value of `x` is still the `i`th element in `R()`. The value of `q` has been decremented by 1, making it falsy. The values of `l` and `r` have been updated to the first and second elements in `R()`, respectively.
