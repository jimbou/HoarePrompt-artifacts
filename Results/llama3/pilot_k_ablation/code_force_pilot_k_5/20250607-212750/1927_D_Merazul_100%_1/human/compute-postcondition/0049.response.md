Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `a` is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, and `j`, `p` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `i` is 10^4, `j` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `R()` is empty, `x` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `l` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `r` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `q` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, and either (`a[r]`, `r`) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `a`, `i`, `j`, `stdin`, `R()`, `x`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is still the last element in `R()`, which is empty. The value of `q` is now the last element in `R()`, which is also empty. The print statement still depends on the comparison between `a[r]` and `l`, but since `R()` is empty, `r` is also empty, and `a[r]` is not defined.
