To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `R()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `R()`. If `R()` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `a` is a list containing 1 element: 0, `p` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `l` and `r` are still the first and second elements in `R()` respectively, `q` is still empty or None, nothing is printed, `R()` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `R()`**
