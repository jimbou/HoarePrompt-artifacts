The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is at least 0 and is one less than its original value and is not None. So for the loop to be executed one more time q must be at least 1 and is not None.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the second last element in R(), i is n, j is either j or n-1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element in R(), l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is at least 1 and is one less than its original value and is not None, and nothing is printed, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or (-1, -1) depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
