The print statement will print either the value of `a[r]` and `r` or `-1` and `-1` depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`. 

Since `a` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and `n` copies of `j`, and `r` is the second element in `R()`, `a[r]` will be `j` if `r` is not `0`. 

Also, `l` is the first element in `R()`, and `j` is either `j` or `n-1` depending on whether the last element in `R()` is equal to the second last element in `R()`. 

If the last element in `R()` is equal to the second last element in `R()`, then `j` will be `j`. 

If the last element in `R()` is not equal to the second last element in `R()`, then `j` will be `n-1`. 

In either case, `a[r]` will be `j` or `n-1` if `r` is not `0`. 

Since `l` is the first element in `R()`, `l` will be less than or equal to `r` because `r` is the second element in `R()`. 

Therefore, `a[r]` will be greater than or equal to `l` if `r` is not `0`. 

So, the condition `a[r] < l` will be `False` if `r` is not `0`. 

If `r` is `0`, then `a[r]` will be `0` because `a` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and `n` copies of `j`. 

In this case, `a[r]` will be less than `l` because `l` is the first element in `R()` and `l` will be greater than or equal to `0`. 

So, the condition `a[r] < l` will be `True` if `r` is `0`. 

Therefore, the print statement will print `(-1, -1)` if `r` is not `0`, and `(0, 0)` if `r` is `0`. 

Output: **(-1, -1) or (0, 0) depending on whether r is 0**
