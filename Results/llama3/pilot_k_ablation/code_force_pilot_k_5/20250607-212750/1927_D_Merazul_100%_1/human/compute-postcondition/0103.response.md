The code prints either the value of `a[r]` and `r` or -1 and -1 depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`. Here, `a[r]` is the element at index `r` in the list `a`, `r` is the second element in the list `R()`, and `l` is the first element in the list `R()`. 

Output: **either (a[r], r) or (-1, -1) depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
