Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines: each line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), then an integer q (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5), and finally q pairs of integers l and r (1 <= l < r <= n).
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    R()
    a = [0]
    p = i = j = 0
    for x in R():
        j = (j, i)[x != p]
        a += j,
        p = x
        i += 1
    q, = R()
    while q:
        q -= 1
        l, r = R()
        print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is truthy, i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, q is falsy, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the first element returned by R(), r is the second element returned by R(), q is 0, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the second last element in R(), i is n, j is either j or n-1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element in R(), l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is empty or None, and nothing is printed, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or (-1, -1) depending on whether a[r] is less than l.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the last element in R(), i is n, j is 1 if the last element in R() is not equal to the second last element in R(), otherwise j is 0, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, x is the second last element in R(), and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l, R() has at least n-1 elements.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing i+1 elements: 0 and i-1 elements equal to j, p is the ith element in R(), i is i, j is 1 if x is not equal to the (i-1)th element in R(), otherwise j is i-1, x is the ith element in R(), q is falsy, l is the first element in R(), and r is the second element in R(), and either (a[r], r) is printed if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1] is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
