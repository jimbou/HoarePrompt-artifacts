According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is truthy and is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time q must be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is truthy, i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty, x is the last element in R() which must be truthy, q is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value, l is the second last element in R(), r is the last element in R() which is truthy, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
