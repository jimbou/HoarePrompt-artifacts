Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the last element in R(), i is n, j is 1 if the last element in R() is not equal to the second last element in R(), otherwise j is 0, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is the last element in R() minus 5, x is the second last element in R(), and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l, R() has at least n-1 elements, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l, where a[r] is the rth element in the list a and r is the second element in R()**
