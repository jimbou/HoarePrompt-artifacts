To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `R()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the fourth element in `R()`. For the loop to execute again, `R()` must have at least 5 elements, and `x` must be the fifth element in `R()`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `a` is a list containing 5 elements: 0, `j`, `j`, `j`, and `j`, `p` is the fourth element in `R()`, `i` is 4, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the third element in `R()`, otherwise `j` is 2, `l` and `r` are the first and second elements in `R()` respectively, `q` is 0, `R()` has at least 5 elements, `x` is the fifth element in `R()`**
