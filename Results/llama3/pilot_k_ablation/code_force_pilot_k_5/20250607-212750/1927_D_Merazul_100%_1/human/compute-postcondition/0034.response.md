Output: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is truthy, i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, q is truthy and its value is greater than 3, l is the last element in R(), r is the second last element in R(), and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l. If a[r] is less than l, then (a[r], r) is printed where a[r] is either 0 or t-1 and r is the second last element in R(). If a[r] is not less than l, then [-1, -1] is printed.**
