The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, so for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the second last element in R(), i is n, j is either j or n-1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element in R(), l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is empty or None, and nothing is printed, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or (-1, -1) depending on whether a[r] is less than l.**
