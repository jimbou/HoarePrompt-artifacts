Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `a` is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, `j`, and `j`, `p` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `i` is 10^4, `j` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `R()` is empty, `x` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `l` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `r` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, `q` is the last element in `R()` which is empty, and either (`a[r]`, `r`) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`.
Code of the loop:
while q:
    q -= 1
    l, r = R()
    print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, q is not empty and is one less than its original value, l and r are the first and second elements returned by R() respectively, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, q is not empty and is at least 1 and q currently must be greater than -1, l and r are the first and second elements returned by R() respectively, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the first element returned by R(), r is the second element returned by R(), q is at least 0 and currently must be greater than -2, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the first element returned by R(), r is the second element returned by R(), q is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the first element returned by R(), r is the second element returned by R(), q is greater than 0 and is one less than its original value which is greater than 1, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
