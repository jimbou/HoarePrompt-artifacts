Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing four elements: 0, j, j, and j, p is the third element in R(), i is 3, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 3 elements, x is the third element in R()**

The code block modifies the values of `j`, `a`, `p`, and `i`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `j` if `x` is not equal to `p`, otherwise it keeps the original value of `j`. The second line appends the new value of `j` to the list `a`. The third line assigns the value of `x` to `p`. The fourth line increments the value of `i` by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
