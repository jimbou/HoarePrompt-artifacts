Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines: each line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), then an integer q (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5), and finally q pairs of integers l and r (1 <= l < r <= n), a is a list containing a single element 0, p, i, and j are all 0.**
