To determine the output of the given print statement, let's break down the initial state and the code step by step.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4.
   - `a` is a list containing `t+1` elements: 0 and `t` copies of `j`.
   - `p` is truthy.
   - `i` is `t`.
   - `j` is either 0 or `t-1`.
   - `q` is truthy and its value is greater than 3.
   - `l` is the last element in `R()`.
   - `r` is the second last element in `R()`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The expression `a[r] < l` is evaluated first. Since `r` is the second last element in `R()` and `l` is the last element in `R()`, and without knowing the exact nature of `R()`, we can't determine the exact values of `r` and `l`. However, this comparison will yield a boolean value (`True` or `False`).
   - The expression `*(((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])` uses the result of the comparison to index into a tuple. If `a[r] < l` is `True`, it selects the first element of the tuple, which is `(a[r], r)`. If `a[r] < l` is `False`, it selects the second element, which is `[-1] * 2`, resulting in `[-1, -1]`.
   - The `*` operator unpacks the selected tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Possible Outputs**:
   - If `a[r] < l` is `True`, the output will be the value of `a[r]` (which is either 0 or `t-1`, depending on the value of `j`) and the value of `r`.
   - If `a[r] < l` is `False`, the output will be `-1` printed twice.

Given the initial state and without knowing the exact values of `r`, `l`, and `j`, we can describe the output as follows:

Output: **Either (a[r], r) where a[r] is 0 or t-1 and r is the second last element in R(), or -1 -1**
