Output State: **t is 0, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the last element in R(), i is n, j is either 0 or n-1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element in R(), l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, x is the last element in R(), and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of t will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The list a will contain n+1 elements, where n is the number of elements in the input list, and all elements except the first one will be equal to j, which is either 0 or n-1 depending on whether the last element in the input list is equal to the second last element. The variable p will be the last element in the input list, i will be equal to n, and j will be either 0 or n-1 depending on whether the last element in the input list is equal to the second last element. The variables l and r will be the first and second elements in the input list respectively, q will be 0, and x will be the last element in the input list. Finally, either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] will be printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.
