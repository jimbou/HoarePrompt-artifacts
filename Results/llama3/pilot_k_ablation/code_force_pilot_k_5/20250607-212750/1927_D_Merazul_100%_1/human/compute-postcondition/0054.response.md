According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is not empty and is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time q needed to have been at least 2 and q currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, q is not empty and is at least 2 and q currently must be greater than 0, l and r are the first and second elements returned by R() respectively, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
