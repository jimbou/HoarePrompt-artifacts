The only object in the loop head is variable x and R(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the R(). If the R() is not empty the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, R() is not empty, x is the first element in R(), p is the first element in R(), i is 1, j is either 0 or i, a is a list containing two elements: 0 and j, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines. So for the loop to be executed one more time the R() must have at least 2 elements and the x is the second element in R(), p is the second element in R(). 
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing two elements: 0 and j, p is the second element in R(), i is 1, j is either 0 or i, stdin contains t-1 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in R()**
