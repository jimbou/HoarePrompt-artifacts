The code prints either the value of `a[r]` and `r` or `-1` and `-1` depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`. Here, `a[r]` is the element at index `r` in the list `a`, `r` is the second element in the list `R()`, `l` is the first element in the list `R()`. The value of `a[r]` is either `j` or `n-1` depending on whether the last element in `R()` is equal to the second last element in `R()`. The value of `r` is the second last element in `R()`, and the value of `l` is the first element in `R()`.

Output: **either (a[r], r) or (-1, -1) depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
