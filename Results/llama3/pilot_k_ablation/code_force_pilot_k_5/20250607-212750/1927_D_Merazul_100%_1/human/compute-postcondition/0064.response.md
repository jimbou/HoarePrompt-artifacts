To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the print statement itself.

1. **Variables and Their Values**:
   - `t`: An integer between 0 and 10^4.
   - `a`: A list containing 10^4 + 1 elements, where the first element is 0, and all other elements are `j`.
   - `p`, `x`: Both are the last element in `R()`, which is empty, implying both are undefined or None in the context of this print statement.
   - `i`: Equals 10^4.
   - `j`: Either 0 or 1.
   - `stdin`: Contains 0 lines.
   - `R()`: Empty, implying it returns no elements.
   - `l`: The first element returned by `R()`, which is empty, so `l` is undefined or None.
   - `r`: The second element returned by `R()`, which is empty, so `r` is undefined or None.
   - `q`: Greater than 0 and is one less than its original value, but its exact value isn't relevant to the print statement.

2. **The Print Statement**:
   ```
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```

   This statement uses a conditional expression to decide what to print. The condition is `a[r] < l`. However, given that `l` is undefined (since `R()` is empty), this comparison is problematic. But, considering the structure of the statement and the information provided, we can infer the following:

   - If `a[r] < l`, it would print `(a[r], r)`. However, since `l` is undefined, this comparison is not directly evaluable based on the given information.
   - If the condition is not met (which would be the case if `l` is undefined or if `a[r]` is not less than `l`), it prints `[-1] * 2`, which is `[-1, -1]`.

Given the initial state, especially that `R()` is empty and thus `l` and `r` are undefined, the direct comparison `a[r] < l` cannot be reliably evaluated in the traditional sense because `l` and `r` do not hold values that can be compared to `a[r]`. However, the logic of the print statement suggests that if `a[r]` and `l` were defined and comparable, it would print `(a[r], r)` if the condition is true. Since we cannot accurately assess the truth of `a[r] < l` due to the undefined nature of `l` and `r`, and considering the structure of the conditional expression, the code's behavior hinges on how it handles undefined values in comparisons.

Given the information and focusing strictly on the logic presented without assuming additional context (like how undefined values are handled in comparisons), the most straightforward interpretation based on the provided details is that the comparison cannot be resolved as intended due to the undefined state of `l` and `r`. However, in a typical programming context, attempting to access `a[r]` where `r` is undefined or out of range, and comparing with an undefined `l`, would lead to errors or undefined behavior.

But, adhering strictly to the format and the explicit details given, without assuming error handling or specific behaviors for undefined values in comparisons, and recognizing the conditional structure's dependency on defined values for `l` and `r` which are not provided:

Output: **[-1, -1]**
