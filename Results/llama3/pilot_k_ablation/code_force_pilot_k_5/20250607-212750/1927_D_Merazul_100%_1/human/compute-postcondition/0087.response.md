The code prints either the value of `a[r]` and `r` or `-1` repeated twice, depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`. 

Since `a` is a list containing `n+1` elements: `0` and `n` copies of `j`, `a[r]` will be either `0` or `j`. 

`r` is the second element in `R()`, but the exact value of `r` is not provided. However, since `r` is an element in `R()`, it is an integer.

`l` is the first element in `R()`, but the exact value of `l` is not provided. However, since `l` is an element in `R()`, it is an integer.

Since `a[r]` is either `0` or `j` and `l` is an integer, `a[r]` is less than `l` if `l` is greater than `0` or if `l` is greater than `j`. 

If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the code prints `a[r]` and `r`. 

If `a[r]` is not less than `l`, the code prints `-1` repeated twice.

Output: **(a[r], r) if a[r] is less than l, otherwise (-1, -1)**
