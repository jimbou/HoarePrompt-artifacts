According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is two less than its original value minus 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of q needed to have been greater than 4 and q currently must be truthy.

State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is truthy, i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, q is truthy and its original value is greater than 4, l is the last element in R(), r is the second last element in R()**
