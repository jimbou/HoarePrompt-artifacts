Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is the last element in R(), i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R()**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `a` will contain `t+1` elements, where `t` is the initial value of `t`. The first element of `a` will be 0, and the remaining `t` elements will be copies of the value of `j`. The value of `j` will be either 0 or `t-1`, depending on whether the last element of `R()` is equal to 0. The variable `p` will be the last element of `R()`, and the variable `i` will be equal to `t`. The `stdin` will be empty, and `R()` will also be empty. The variable `x` will be the last element of `R()`.
