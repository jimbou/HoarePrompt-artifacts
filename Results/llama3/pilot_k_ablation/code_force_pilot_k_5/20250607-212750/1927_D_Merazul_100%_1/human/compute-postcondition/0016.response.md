Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is truthy, i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is not empty, x is the last element in R() which must be truthy, q is truthy and is one less than its original value, l is the second last element in R(), r is the last element in R() which is truthy.**

In this output state, the value of `q` has been decremented by 1, and the values of `l` and `r` have been assigned the second last and last elements of `R()`, respectively. The last element of `R()` is truthy and is also assigned to `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.
