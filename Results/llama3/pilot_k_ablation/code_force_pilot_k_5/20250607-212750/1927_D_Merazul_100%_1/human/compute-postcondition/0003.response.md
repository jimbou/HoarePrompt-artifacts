The only variable in the loop head is `x` and `R()`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `R()`. If `R()` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, a is a list containing a single element 0, p, i, and j are all 0. So for the loop to be executed, `R()` must not be empty, and `x` is the first element in `R()`.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines, a is a list containing a single element 0, p is 0, i is 0, j is 0, R() is not empty, x is the first element in R()**
