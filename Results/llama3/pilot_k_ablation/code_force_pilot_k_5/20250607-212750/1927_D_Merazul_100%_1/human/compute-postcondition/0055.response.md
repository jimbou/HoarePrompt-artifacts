Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, q is not empty and is at least 1 and q currently must be greater than -1, l and r are the first and second elements returned by R() respectively, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l**

In this output state, the value of q has been decremented by 1, and l and r have been assigned the first and second elements returned by R() respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
