Functionality: **This function reads a sequence of lines from standard input, where the first line contains an integer t, and each of the following t lines contains an integer n, followed by n integers, an integer q, and q pairs of integers. It then processes each line, creating a list a of length n+1, where a[i] is the index of the last occurrence of the i-th integer in the input sequence. For each pair of integers l and r, it prints either the value of a[r] and r, or [-1, -1] if a[r] is less than l. The function repeats this process t times, and finally, it prints the results for all pairs of integers.**
