The code prints either the value of `a[r]` and `r` as a tuple, or the list `[-1, -1]`, depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l`. 

Since `a[r]` is the `r`th element in the list `a`, and `r` is the second element in `R()`, and `a` contains `i+1` elements: 0 and `i-1` elements equal to `j`, where `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the `(i-1)`th element in `R()`, otherwise `j` is `i-1`, and `x` is the `i`th element in `R()`, and `i` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, we can't determine the exact value of `a[r]`. 

However, we can determine that `r` is the second element in `R()`. 

Also, since `l` is the first element in `R()`, we can't determine whether `a[r]` is less than `l` or not. 

Therefore, we can't determine the exact output of the print statement. 

However, we can describe the output as either the value of `a[r]` and `r` as a tuple, or the list `[-1, -1]`, depending on whether `a[r]` is less than `l` or not.

Output: **either (a[r], r) if a[r] is not less than l, otherwise [-1, -1]**
