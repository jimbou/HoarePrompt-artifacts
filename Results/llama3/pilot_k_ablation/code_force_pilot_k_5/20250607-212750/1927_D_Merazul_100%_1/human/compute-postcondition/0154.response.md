Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `a` is a list containing `i`+1 elements: 0 and `i`-1 elements equal to `j`, `p` is the `i`th element in `R()`, `i` is `i`, `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the (`i`-1)th element in `R()`, otherwise `j` is `i`-1, `l` and `r` are the first and second elements in `R()` respectively, `q` is the first element in `R()`, `R()` has at least `i` elements, `x` is the `i`th element in `R()`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains the same, between 0 and 10^4. The list `a` still contains `i`+1 elements, with 0 and `i`-1 elements equal to `j`. The value of `p` is still the `i`th element in `R()`. The value of `i` remains the same. The value of `j` is still 1 if `x` is not equal to the (`i`-1)th element in `R()`, otherwise it is `i`-1. The values of `l` and `r` are still the first and second elements in `R()` respectively. The value of `q` is now the first element in `R()`. The list `R()` still has at least `i` elements. The value of `x` is still the `i`th element in `R()`.
