To determine what will be printed when the statement executes, let's break down the given information and the code step by step.

1. **Understanding the Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4.
   - `a` is a list containing `i+1` elements: 0 and `i-1` elements equal to `j`.
   - `p` is the ith element in `R()`.
   - `i` is `i`.
   - `j` is 1 if `x` is not equal to the `(i-1)`th element in `R()`, otherwise `j` is `i-1`.
   - `l` is the first element in `R()`.
   - `r` is the second element in `R()`.
   - `q` is falsy.
   - `R()` has at least `i` elements.
   - `x` is the ith element in `R()`.

2. **Analyzing the Code:**
   The code to be executed is:
   ```
   print(*((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l])
   ```
   This line of code uses several features of Python:
   - `a[r]`: Accesses the `r`th element of list `a`.
   - `(a[r], r)`: Creates a tuple containing the `r`th element of `a` and `r` itself.
   - `[-1] * 2`: Creates a list containing two `-1`s.
   - `((a[r], r), [-1] * 2)[a[r] < l]`: This is a conditional expression. If `a[r]` is less than `l`, it returns the first tuple `(a[r], r)`, otherwise it returns the list `[-1] * 2`.
   - `*`: The unpacking operator. It unpacks the elements of the returned tuple or list into separate arguments for the `print` function.

3. **Determining the Output:**
   - If `a[r]` is less than `l`, the expression will evaluate to `(a[r], r)`, and the `print` statement will output the `r`th element of `a` and `r` itself.
   - If `a[r]` is not less than `l`, the expression will evaluate to `[-1] * 2`, and the `print` statement will output two `-1`s.

Given the initial state, we cannot determine the exact numerical values of `a[r]`, `l`, `r`, or the elements of `a` without knowing the specific values of `i`, `j`, `R()`, and `x`. However, we can describe the output based on the conditions provided.

**Output:** **Either the rth element of a and r, or two -1s, depending on whether the rth element of a is less than the first element of R().**
