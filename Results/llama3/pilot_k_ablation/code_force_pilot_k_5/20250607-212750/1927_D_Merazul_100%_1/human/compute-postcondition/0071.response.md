According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4. So for the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the first element returned by R(), r is the second element returned by R(), q is 0, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l.**
