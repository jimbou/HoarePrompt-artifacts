The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the last element in R(), i is n, j is 1 if the last element in R() is not equal to the second last element in R(), otherwise j is 0, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, x is the second last element in R(), and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l, R() has at least n-1 elements.**
