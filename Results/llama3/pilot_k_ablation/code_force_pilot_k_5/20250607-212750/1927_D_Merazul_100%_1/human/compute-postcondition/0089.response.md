According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q. If q is not empty or not None, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is non-empty or not None and is one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time q needed to have been at least 2 and q currently must be greater than 0 and not None.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing n+1 elements: 0 and n copies of j, p is the second last element in R(), i is n, j is either j or n-1 depending on whether the last element in R() is equal to the second last element in R(), l is the first element in R(), r is the second element in R(), q is at least 2 and is one less than its original value and is not None, and nothing is printed, and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or (-1, -1) depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
