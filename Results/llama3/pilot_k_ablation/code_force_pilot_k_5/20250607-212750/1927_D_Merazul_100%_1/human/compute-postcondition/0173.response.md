The code prints either the value of `a[r]` and `r` or `[-1, -1]` based on the condition `a[r] < l`. 

Since `a` is a list containing `i+1` elements: `0` and `i-1` elements equal to `j`, and `r` is the second element in `R()`, `a[r]` will be equal to `j` if `r` is not equal to `0`, otherwise it will be `0`. 

The value of `j` is `1` if `x` is not equal to the `(i-1)`th element in `R()`, otherwise `j` is `i-1`. 

The value of `l` is the first element in `R()`.

So, the condition `a[r] < l` will be true if `j` is less than the first element in `R()`, otherwise it will be false.

If the condition is true, the code will print `[-1, -1]`. 

If the condition is false, the code will print the value of `a[r]` which is `j` and the value of `r` which is the second element in `R()`.

Output: **either (j, the second element in R()) if j is not less than the first element in R(), otherwise [-1, -1]**
