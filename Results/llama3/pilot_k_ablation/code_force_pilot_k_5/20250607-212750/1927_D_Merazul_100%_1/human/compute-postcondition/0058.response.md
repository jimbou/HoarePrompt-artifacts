The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is not empty and is at least 1 and q currently must be greater than -1. q being not empty and is at least 1 and q currently must be greater than -1 does ensure that the loop will execute again, so it does not need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the last element in R() which is empty, r is the last element in R() which is empty, q is not empty and is at least 1 and q currently must be greater than -1, l and r are the first and second elements returned by R() respectively, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
