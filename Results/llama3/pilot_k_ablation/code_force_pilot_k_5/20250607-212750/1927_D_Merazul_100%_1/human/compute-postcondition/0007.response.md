To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `x` and `R()`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is the second element in `R()`, and `R()` is not empty and has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `R()` must have at least 3 elements.

Since `x` is the second element in `R()` at the end of the previous iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `x` will be the third element in `R()`.

The other variables `t`, `a`, `p`, `i`, `j`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4, `a` is a list containing three elements: 0, `j`, and `j`, `p` is the second element in `R()`, `i` is 2, `j` is either 0 or 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` lines, `R()` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `R()`**
