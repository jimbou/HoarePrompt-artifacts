Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines: each line contains an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5), then n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^6), then an integer q (1 <= q <= 2 * 10^5), and finally q pairs of integers l and r (1 <= l < r <= n), a is a list containing a single element 0, p, i, and j are all 0.
Code of the loop:
for x in R():
    j = (j, i)[x != p]
    a += j,
    p = x
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing two elements: 0 and j, p is the first element in R(), i is 1, j is either 0 or i (depending on whether the first element in R() is equal to 0), stdin contains t-1 lines, R() is not empty, x is the first element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing three elements: 0, j, and j, p is the second element in R(), i is 2, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing four elements: 0, j, j, and j, p is the third element in R(), i is 3, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 3 elements, x is the third element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing five elements: 0, j, j, j, and j, p is the fourth element in R(), i is 4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 4 elements, x is the fourth element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing six elements: 0, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the fifth element in R(), i is 5, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains t-2 lines, R() is not empty and has at least 5 elements, x is the fifth element in R()




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
