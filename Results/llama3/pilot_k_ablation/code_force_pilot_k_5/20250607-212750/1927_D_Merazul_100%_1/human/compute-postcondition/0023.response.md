According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is truthy, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is greater than 1 and is one less than its original value minus 1, So for the loop to be executed one more time q needed to have been greater than 2 and q currently must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, p is truthy, i is t, j is either 0 or t-1, q is greater than 2 and is one less than its original value minus 1, l is the last element in R() which must be truthy, r is the second last element in R(), and this is printed: either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
