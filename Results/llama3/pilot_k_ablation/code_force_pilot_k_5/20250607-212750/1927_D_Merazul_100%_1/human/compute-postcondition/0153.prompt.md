Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 1 element: 0, p is 0, i is 0, j is 0, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, x is the second last element in R(), and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l, R() has at least n-1 elements.
Code of the loop:
for x in R():
    j = (j, i)[x != p]
    a += j,
    p = x
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 2 elements: 0 and j, p is the first element in R(), i is 1, j is 0 if x is equal to the first element in R(), otherwise j is i, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, R() has at least 1 element, x is the first element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 3 elements: 0, j, and j, p is the second element in R(), i is 2, j is 1 if x is not equal to the first element in R(), otherwise j is 0, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, R() has at least 2 elements, x is the second element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 4 elements: 0, j, j, and j, p is the third element in R(), i is 3, j is 1 if x is not equal to the third element in R(), otherwise j is 2, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, R() has at least 3 elements, x is the third element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 5 elements: 0, j, j, j, and j, p is the fourth element in R(), i is 4, j is 1 if x is not equal to the third element in R(), otherwise j is 2, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, R() has at least 4 elements, x is the fourth element in R()

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 6 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the fifth element in R(), i is 5, j is 1 if x is not equal to the third element in R(), otherwise j is 2, l and r are the first and second elements in R() respectively, q is 0, R() has at least 5 elements, x is the fifth element in R()




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
