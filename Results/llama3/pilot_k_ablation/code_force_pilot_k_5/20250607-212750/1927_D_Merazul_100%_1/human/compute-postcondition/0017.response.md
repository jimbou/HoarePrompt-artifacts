The code prints a tuple containing either the last element of the list `a` and the index of the last element of the list `a`, or a list containing two -1's. The choice between these two options depends on whether the last element of the list `a` is less than the second last element in `R()`. 

Since `a` contains t+1 elements: 0 and t copies of j, and j is either 0 or t-1, the last element of the list `a` will be either 0 or t-1. Also, since `l` is the second last element in `R()` and `r` is the last element in `R()` which is truthy, and `x` is the last element in `R()` which must be truthy, `l` and `r` are the last two elements in `R()` and `r` is truthy.

Since `r` is truthy, `a[r]` will be either 0 or t-1. If `a[r]` is 0, it will be less than `l` because `l` is the second last element in `R()` and `r` is the last element in `R()` which is truthy. If `a[r]` is t-1, it will be less than `l` only if `l` is t.

Therefore, the code will print either `(0, r)` or `[-1, -1]`. 

Output: **(0, r) or [-1, -1] (where r is the last element in R() which is truthy)**
