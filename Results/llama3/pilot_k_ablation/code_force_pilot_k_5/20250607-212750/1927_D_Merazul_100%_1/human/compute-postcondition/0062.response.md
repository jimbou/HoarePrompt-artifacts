The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q.  If q is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is at least 0 and currently must be greater than -2, So for the loop to be executed one more time q must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4, a is a list containing 10^4 + 1 elements: 0, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, j, and j, p is the last element in R() which is empty, i is 10^4, j is either 0 or 1, stdin contains 0 lines, R() is empty, x is the last element in R() which is empty, l is the first element returned by R(), r is the second element returned by R(), q is greater than 0, and either (a[r], r) or [-1, -1] is printed depending on whether a[r] is less than l**
