Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the process described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the different cases where the k-th card is an odd number, twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on.

The program first calculates the number of odd numbers (n) and the total number of cards (n_back). It then enters a loop where it calculates the number of cards that are twice an odd number, three times an odd number, and so on, until it finds the range where the k-th card falls.

The calculation of the k-th card is also correct. It uses the formula (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where s is the total number of cards in the previous ranges, n is the number of cards in the current range, and m is the multiplier (2, 4, 8, etc.).

The program handles the edge cases correctly, such as when k is 1 (the first card is always 1), and when n is 1 (there is only one card).

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
