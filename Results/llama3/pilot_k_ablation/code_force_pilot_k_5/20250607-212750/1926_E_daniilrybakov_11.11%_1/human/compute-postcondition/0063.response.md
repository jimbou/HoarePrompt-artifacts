Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 4, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `m`, `n`, and `s`. The first line doubles the value of `m`, making it 4. The second line halves the value of `n`, which can be either 0 or the original value of `n` divided by 2. The third line adds the new value of `n` to `s`, resulting in either `n_back` or the original value of `s` plus the new value of `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
