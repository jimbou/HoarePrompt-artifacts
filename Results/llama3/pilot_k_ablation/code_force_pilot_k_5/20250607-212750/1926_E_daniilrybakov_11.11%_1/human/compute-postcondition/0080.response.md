Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 1, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where k is the value of k from stdin, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, and m is 1**

The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from stdin, assigns `n` to `n_back`, calculates `s` as `(n + 1) // 2`, updates `n` to `(n + 1) // 2`, and sets `m` to 1. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains unchanged, as it is not used or modified by the code. The value of `k` is updated to the value read from stdin, which must be greater than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4`. The value of `n` is updated to either 0 or the value of `n` from the initial state divided by 2. The value of `s` is updated to either `n_back` or the value of `s` from the initial state plus `n`. The value of `m` is set to 1. The expression `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m` is printed, where `k` is the value of `k` from stdin, `s` is either `n_back` or the value of `s` from the initial state plus `n`, `n` is either 0 or the value of `n` from the initial state divided by 2, and `m` is 1.
