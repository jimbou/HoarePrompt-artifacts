The variables in the loop head are s and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables s and k. If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4. For the loop to be executed one more time, s must be less than k, so s must be less than the value of k from stdin and s must be less than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, and k must be greater than s. Also, n must be either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, and s must be either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 4, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n and s must be less than k and s must be less than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, and k must be greater than s**
