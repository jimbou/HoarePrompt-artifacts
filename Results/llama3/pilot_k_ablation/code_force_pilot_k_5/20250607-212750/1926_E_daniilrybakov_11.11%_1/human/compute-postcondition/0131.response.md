Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than or equal to 0, _ is t - 1, m is 2^x, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + ... + 1, if n is 0, then s is equal to n_back and n is 1, otherwise s is less than k and n is (n_back + 1) // 2^x, stdin contains 0 lines, and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, has been printed t times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variable `_` has reached the value of `t - 1`. The variable `m` is a power of 2, and the variable `k` is an integer between 1 and `n_back` (inclusive) and is greater than the sum of the first `x` terms of the sequence `(n_back + 1) // 2^i`. If `n` is 0, then `s` is equal to `n_back` and `n` is 1; otherwise, `s` is less than `k` and `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2^x`. The input file `stdin` is empty, and a multiple of `2^x` (less than or equal to `2 * k - 1`) has been printed `t` times.
