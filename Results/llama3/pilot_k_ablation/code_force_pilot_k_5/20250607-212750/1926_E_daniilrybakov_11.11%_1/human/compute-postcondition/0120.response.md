According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is less than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + 1` and `k` is greater than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + 1`. `s` being less than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + 1` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 4, _ is 4, m is 8, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + 1, s is less than k, If n is 0, then s is n_back and n is 1. Otherwise, s is less than k and n is (n_back + 1) // 4 // 4. stdin contains t - x - 6 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, is being printed.**
