The code accepts an integer input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). After accepting the integer `t`, the stdin now contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
