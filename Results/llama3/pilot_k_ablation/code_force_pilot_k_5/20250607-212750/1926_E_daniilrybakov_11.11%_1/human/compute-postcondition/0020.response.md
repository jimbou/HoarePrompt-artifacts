According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s and k. If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n if n is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise s is n_back + 1 + n and s must be less than k, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s. s being less than k does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to s must be less than k - 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is 16, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n if n is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise s is n_back + 1 + n and s must be less than k - 1, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
