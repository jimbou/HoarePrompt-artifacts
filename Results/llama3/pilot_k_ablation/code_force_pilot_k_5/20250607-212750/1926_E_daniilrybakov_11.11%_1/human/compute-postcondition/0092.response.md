Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 4, if n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back. Otherwise, the values of n and s remain unchanged. In both cases, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is an integer and n is less than or equal to its original value, s is an integer and s is greater than or equal to its original value.***
