Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 32, k is an integer greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s and k is greater than s, if n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back. Otherwise, the values of n and s remain unchanged. In both cases, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is an integer, s is an integer.**

The code multiplies `m` by 2, making it 32. It then divides `n` by 2, effectively halving its value. Finally, it adds the new value of `n` to `s`, updating `s` to be the sum of its original value and the halved value of `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, `k`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
