To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `s < k`. The state right before the loop provides us with information about `s` and `k`, but we need to focus on adjusting the states of `s` and `k` to guarantee the loop can execute at least once.

Given:
- `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`
- `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` and must be greater than `s`

Since `s` is calculated as `(n + 1) // 2`, and `k` must be greater than `s`, we don't necessarily need to adjust `s` or `k` because the condition for the loop to execute (`s < k`) is already guaranteed by the given conditions. However, to ensure clarity and adherence to the task's requirements, we should confirm that the relationship between `n`, `s`, and `k` supports the loop's execution.

- `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value (`n_back`).
- `s` being `(n + 1) // 2` means it's inherently less than or equal to `n`, given `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2` and specifically greater than `s`, which aligns with the requirement for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the states provided already support the execution of the loop without needing adjustments to ensure the first iteration can proceed. The critical aspect is the relationship between `s` and `k`, which is already defined in a way that supports the loop's condition.

State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 1, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is (n + 1) // 2, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
