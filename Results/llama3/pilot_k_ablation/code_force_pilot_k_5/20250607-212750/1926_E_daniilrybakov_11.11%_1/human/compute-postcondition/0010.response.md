Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If n is 0, then s is n_back, n is 1. Otherwise, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4), n is greater than or equal to 2, and m is 2. In both cases, k must be greater than (n + 1) // 2.**
