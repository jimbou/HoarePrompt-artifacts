Postcondition: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is 1, `n` is 0, `n_back` is less than `2k - 1`, `s` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is the value of `k` from stdin, stdin contains `t - x - 4` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k` (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).**
