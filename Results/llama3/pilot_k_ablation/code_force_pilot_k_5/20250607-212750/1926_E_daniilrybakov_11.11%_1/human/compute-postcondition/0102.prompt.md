Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 1, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where k is the value of k from stdin, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, and m is 1
Code of the loop:
while s < k:
    if n == 0:
        s = n_back
        n = 1
        break
    m *= 2
    n //= 2
    s += n


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 2, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and s must be less than k, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 4, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, if n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back. Otherwise, the values of n and s remain unchanged. In both cases, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is an integer and n is less than or equal to its original value, s is an integer and s is greater than or equal to its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 8, if n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back. Otherwise, the values of n and s remain unchanged. In both cases, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is an integer and n is less than or equal to its original value, s is an integer and s is greater than or equal to its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 16, n is an integer and n is less than or equal to its original value, n is less than or equal to half of its original value, s is an integer and s is less than k, s is equal to its original value plus half of the original value of n, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 32, if n is 0, then n is set to 1, s is set to n_back, and stdin contains t - x - 6 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). Otherwise, the values of n, s, and stdin remain unchanged. n is half of its original value, s is increased by half of its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
