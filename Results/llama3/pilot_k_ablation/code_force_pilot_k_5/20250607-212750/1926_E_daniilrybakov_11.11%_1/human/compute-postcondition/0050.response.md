Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 2^x, n is greater than or equal to 0 and is 1 / 2^x of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1. Otherwise, n is 1 / 2^x of its original value.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `m` is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations `x`, `n` is 1 / 2^x of its original value, `s` is the sum of the original value of `n_back` and `x - 1` times half of its original value, and `k` is greater than the sum of the original value of `n_back` and `x - 1` times half of its original value. If `n` is 0, it is set to 1, otherwise it is 1 / 2^x of its original value. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
