To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `s` and `k`. According to the code, the loop can execute again if `s` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is either `n` (if `n` is 0) or `((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4)` (if `n` is not 0), and `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `s` and `k` such that `s` is still less than `k`. Since `k` is already greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, we can keep `k` as is.

For `s`, we need to ensure that it is still less than `k`. If `n` is 0, then `s` is `n`, which is 0, and we can keep it as is. If `n` is not 0, then `s` is `((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4)`, and we need to adjust `n` such that `s` is still less than `k`.

Since `k` is greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, we can adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to 2, so that `s` is less than `k`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n_back is n, if n is 0, then s is n, n is 1, and m is 2. Otherwise, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4), n is greater than or equal to 2, and m is 2. In both cases, k must be greater than (n + 1) // 2.**
