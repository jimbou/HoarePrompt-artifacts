The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 2^x, n is greater than or equal to 0 and is 1 / 2^x of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, stdin contains t - x - 3 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1. Otherwise, n is 1 / 2^x of its original value, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m**
