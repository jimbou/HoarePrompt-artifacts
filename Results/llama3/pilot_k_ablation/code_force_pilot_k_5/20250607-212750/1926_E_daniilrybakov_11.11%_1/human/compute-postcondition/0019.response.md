Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is 16, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n if n is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise s is n_back + 1 + n and s must be less than k, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**

The code multiplies `m` by 2, making it 16. It then halves the value of `n`, which was originally greater than or equal to 1. The new value of `n` is still greater than or equal to 1. The code also increments `s` by the new value of `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `s` becomes ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n, otherwise it becomes n_back + 1 + n. In both cases, `s` remains less than `k`. The value of `k` is still greater than (n + 1) // 2 and greater than `s`. The state of `t` and `_` remains unchanged. Stdin still contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
