Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 8, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is 1, s is n_back.**

The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to the variables `s` and `n`. The first line sets `s` to the value of `n_back`, and the second line sets `n` to 1. The `break` statement is not relevant in this context as it is not part of a loop or conditional statement.

Given the initial state, `t` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, and greater than 2. The variable `_` remains 2, and `m` remains 8. The value of `k` from stdin is still greater than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4` and greater than `s`. The stdin still contains `t - x - 4` lines, each with two integers `n_back` and `k`, where `1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9`.

The only changes are that `n` is now 1, and `s` is now equal to `n_back`. All other conditions and values from the initial state remain valid.
