Postcondition: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 1, the original value of n was greater than or equal to 1 and was halved to get the current value of n which is 0, n_back is the original value of n, s is (n_back + 1) // 2, k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**
