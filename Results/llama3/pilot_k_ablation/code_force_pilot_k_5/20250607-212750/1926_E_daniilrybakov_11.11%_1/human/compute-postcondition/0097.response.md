Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 16, n is an integer and n is less than or equal to its original value, n is less than or equal to half of its original value, s is an integer and s is less than k, s is equal to its original value plus half of the original value of n, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).**
