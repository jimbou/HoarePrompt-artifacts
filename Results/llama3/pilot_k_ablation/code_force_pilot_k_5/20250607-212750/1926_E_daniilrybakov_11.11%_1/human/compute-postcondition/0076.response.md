Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 2^x, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of m is 2 raised to the power of the number of iterations, and the value of s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n. The value of n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2. The value of k is the value of k from stdin and must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
