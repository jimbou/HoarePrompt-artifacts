Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 4, _ is 4, m is 4, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + 1, if n is 0, then s is n_back and n is 1, otherwise s is (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and n is (n_back + 1) // 4 // 2, stdin contains t - x - 6 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, is being printed.**

The code modifies the values of `m`, `n`, and `s`. The first line doubles the value of `m`, making it 4. The second line halves the value of `n`, and since `n` was `(n_back + 1) // 4`, it becomes `(n_back + 1) // 4 // 2`. The third line adds the new value of `n` to `s`, making it `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + (n_back + 1) // 4`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
