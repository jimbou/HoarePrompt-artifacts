Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 4, n is less than or equal to half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) if n is 0, otherwise stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been doubled to 4. The value of `n` has been halved. The value of `s` has been incremented by half of the original value of `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
