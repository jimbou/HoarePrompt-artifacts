Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 2^x, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2^x, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and s is greater than or equal to k, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is characterized by the following conditions:

*   The value of `t` remains unchanged, within the range of 1 to 5 * 10^4 and greater than 3.
*   The value of `_` remains unchanged at 3.
*   The value of `m` is 2 raised to the power of `x`, where `x` represents the number of iterations.
*   The value of `k` is an integer within the range of 1 to `n_back` (which is less than or equal to 10^9) and is greater than the sum of `(n_back + 1) // 2` and `(n_back + 1) // 4`.
*   The value of `n` is either 0 or the initial value of `n` divided by 2 raised to the power of `x`.
*   The value of `s` is either `n_back` or the initial value of `s` plus `n`, and is greater than or equal to `k`.
*   The `stdin` contains `t - x - 5` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k` within the specified ranges.

Overall, the loop iterates until the condition `s < k` is no longer true, at which point the values of `m`, `n`, and `s` are updated accordingly, and the loop terminates.
