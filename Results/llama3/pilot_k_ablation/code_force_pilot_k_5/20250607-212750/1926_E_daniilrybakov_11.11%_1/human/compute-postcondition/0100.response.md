Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 16, if n is 0, then n is set to 1, s is set to n_back, and stdin contains t - x - 6 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). Otherwise, the values of n, s, and stdin remain unchanged.***
