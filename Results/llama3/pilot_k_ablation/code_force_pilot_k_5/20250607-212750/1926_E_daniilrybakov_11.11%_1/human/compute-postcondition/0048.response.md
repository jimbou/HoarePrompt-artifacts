Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 16, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus 1, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1. Otherwise, n is half of its original value.***
