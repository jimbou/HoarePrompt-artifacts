Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 1, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is 1, and s is n_back**

The code snippet assigns the value of `n_back` to `s`, sets `n` to 1, and then encounters a `break` statement, which terminates the loop. The values of `t`, `_`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as no input operations are performed.
