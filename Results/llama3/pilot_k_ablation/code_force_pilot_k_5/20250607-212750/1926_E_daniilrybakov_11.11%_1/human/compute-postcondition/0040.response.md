Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 4, if n is 0, then n is 1, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n, k is greater than the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). Otherwise, the values of n, n_back, s, and k remain unchanged.***
