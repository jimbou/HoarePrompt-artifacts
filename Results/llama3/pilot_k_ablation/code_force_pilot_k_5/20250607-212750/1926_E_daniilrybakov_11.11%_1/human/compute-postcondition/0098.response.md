According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is less than `k`, `s` is equal to its original value plus half of the original value of `n`, and `k` is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and `k` is greater than `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must be less than `k`, so `k` must be greater than `s` and `s` must be less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 16, n is an integer and n is less than or equal to its original value, n is less than or equal to half of its original value, s is an integer and s is less than k, s is equal to its original value plus half of the original value of n, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**
