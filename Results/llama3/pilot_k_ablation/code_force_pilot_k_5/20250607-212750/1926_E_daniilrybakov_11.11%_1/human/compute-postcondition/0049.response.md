Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 32, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus 1, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1. Otherwise, n is a quarter of its original value.**

The code execution has the following effects on the program state:

- The value of `m` is doubled, making it 32.
- The value of `n` is halved. If `n` was originally 0, it is set to 1; otherwise, it becomes a quarter of its original value.
- The value of `s` is incremented by the new value of `n`, which is half of its original value. Therefore, `s` becomes equal to the original value of `n_back` plus half of its original value plus half of its original value.

All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
