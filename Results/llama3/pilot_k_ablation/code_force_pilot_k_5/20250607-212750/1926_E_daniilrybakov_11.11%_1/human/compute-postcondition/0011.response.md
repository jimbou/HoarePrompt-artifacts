Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is 4, n is greater than or equal to 1, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n if n is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise s is n_back + 1, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2, stdin contains t - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).**

The code multiplies the value of `m` by 2, making it 4. It then performs integer division on `n` by 2, effectively halving its value. The value of `s` is incremented by the new value of `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged. Stdin now contains `t - 2` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k`.
