Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4), stdin contains `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    n_back = n
    s = (n + 1) // 2
    n = (n + 1) // 2
    m = 1
    while s < k:
        if n == 0:
            s = n_back
            n = 1
            break
        m *= 2
        n //= 2
        s += n
    print((2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is 2^x, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n if n is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise s is n_back + 1 + n and s must be less than k - x + 1, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1, s is set to n_back + 1, and k remains greater than (n + 1) // 2 and greater than s, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and greater than s, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, m is 2^x, and s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n if n is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise s is n_back + 1 + n

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 2^x, n is greater than or equal to 0 and is 1 / 2^x of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1. Otherwise, n is 1 / 2^x of its original value, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 2^x, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where k is the value of k from stdin, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, and m is 2^x

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 2^x, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2^x, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and s is greater than or equal to k, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 4, _ is 4, m is a power of 2, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + 1, if n is 0, then s is equal to n_back and n is 1, otherwise s is less than k and n is (n_back + 1) // 4 // 4, stdin contains t - x - 6 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, is being printed, and the following is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
