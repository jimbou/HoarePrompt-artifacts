Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n_back is n, if n is 0, then s is n, n is 1, and m is 2. Otherwise, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4), n is (n + 1) // 4, and m is 2. In both cases, k must be greater than (n + 1) // 2.**

The code multiplies `m` by 2, making it 2. It then divides `n` by 2, effectively making it `(n + 1) // 4` if `n` is not 0, or 0 if `n` is 0. Finally, it adds the new value of `n` to `s`, making it `((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4)` if `n` is not 0, or 0 if `n` is 0. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `k` remain unchanged.
