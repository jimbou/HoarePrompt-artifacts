The only variable in the loop head is variable s and k, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable s and k. If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and s must be less than k. So for the loop to be executed one more time s must be less than k and k must be greater than s. 
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 2, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and s must be less than k, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**
