Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 1, n is (n_back + 1) // 2, n_back is the value of n from stdin, s is (n_back + 1) // 2, k is the value of k from stdin, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same, which is 2. The value of `m` is set to 1 by the code. The value of `n` is updated to `(n_back + 1) // 2`, which is half of the original value of `n_back` plus one, divided by 2. The value of `n_back` is set to the value of `n` from stdin. The value of `s` is also set to `(n_back + 1) // 2`, which is the same as the updated value of `n`. The value of `k` is set to the value of `k` from stdin. The stdin now contains `t - x - 4` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k`, as one line has been read by the code.
