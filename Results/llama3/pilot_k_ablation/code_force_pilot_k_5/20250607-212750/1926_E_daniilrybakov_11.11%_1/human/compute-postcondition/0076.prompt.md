Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 1, n is (n_back + 1) // 2, n_back is the value of n from stdin, s is (n_back + 1) // 2, k is the value of k from stdin, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
while s < k:
    if n == 0:
        s = n_back
        n = 1
        break
    m *= 2
    n //= 2
    s += n


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 2, k is the value of k from stdin, n is (n_back + 1) // 4, s is (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 4, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 8, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back, otherwise n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, and s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n. In both cases, s must be less than k and s must be less than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, and k must be greater than s.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 16, k is an integer greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 32, k is an integer greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s and k is greater than s, if n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back. Otherwise, the values of n and s remain unchanged. In both cases, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is an integer, s is an integer.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
