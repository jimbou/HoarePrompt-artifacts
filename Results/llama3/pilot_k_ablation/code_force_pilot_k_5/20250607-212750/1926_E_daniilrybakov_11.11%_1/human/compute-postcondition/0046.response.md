According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is equal to the original value of `n_back` plus half of its original value, and `k` is greater than the original value of `n_back` plus half of its original value of `n_back`. For the loop to execute again, `s` must be less than `k`, so `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than the original value of `n_back` plus half of its original value plus 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 16, n is half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus 1, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**
