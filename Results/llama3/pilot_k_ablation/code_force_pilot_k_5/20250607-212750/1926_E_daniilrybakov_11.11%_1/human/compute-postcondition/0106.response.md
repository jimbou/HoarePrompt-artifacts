Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 4, _ is 4, m is 1, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, n is (n_back + 1) // 2, s is (n_back + 1) // 2, and s is greater than or equal to k, stdin contains t - x - 6 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, is being printed**

The code first reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, where `n` is assigned to `n_back`. Then, it calculates `s` as `(n + 1) // 2`, which is also assigned to `n`. The value of `m` is set to 1. 

The initial state of `t`, `_`, `k`, and `s` being greater than or equal to `k` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is updated to `(n_back + 1) // 2`, and `s` is also updated to `(n_back + 1) // 2`, which is equal to `n`. The stdin now contains `t - x - 6` lines, each with two integers `n_back` and `k`.
