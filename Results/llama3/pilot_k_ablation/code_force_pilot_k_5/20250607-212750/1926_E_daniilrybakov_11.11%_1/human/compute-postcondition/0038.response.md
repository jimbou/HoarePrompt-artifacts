The only variable in the loop head is variable s and k, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables s and k.  If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is equal to the original value of n plus half of the original value of n and k is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time s must be less than k. So s must be less than k and k must be greater than the original value of n plus half of the original value of n.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 4, n is less than or equal to half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is less than k and k is greater than the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) if n is 0, otherwise stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9)**
