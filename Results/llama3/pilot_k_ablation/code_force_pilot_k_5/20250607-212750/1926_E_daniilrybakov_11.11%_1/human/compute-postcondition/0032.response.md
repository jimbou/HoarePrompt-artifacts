Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 1, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is (n + 1) // 2, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1, n_back is the original value of n, s is the original value of n, k is greater than the original value of n // 2 and k must be greater than the original value of n // 2, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).***
