Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 1, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is (n + 1) // 2, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
while s < k:
    if n == 0:
        s = n_back
        n = 1
        break
    m *= 2
    n //= 2
    s += n


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 2, n is greater than or equal to 0.5 and is a quarter of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is greater than or equal to 0.75 times the original value of n, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 0.5, n_back is the original value of n, s is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the original value of n, k is greater than the original value of n // 2 and k must be greater than the original value of n // 2, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 4, n is less than or equal to half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) if n is 0, otherwise stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 8, if n is 0, then n is 0, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, k is greater than the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). Otherwise, the values of n, n_back, s, and k remain unchanged.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 16, n is half of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of the original value of n_back, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 32, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus 1, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1. Otherwise, n is a quarter of its original value.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
