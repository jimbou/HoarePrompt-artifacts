The variables in the loop head are s and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables s and k. If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is greater than or equal to 0.75 times the original value of n and k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s. s being greater than or equal to 0.75 times the original value of n does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to s is less than k. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 2, n is greater than or equal to 0.5 and is a quarter of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is less than k, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 0.5, n_back is the original value of n, s is greater than or equal to 1.5 times the original value of n, k is greater than the original value of n // 2 and k must be greater than the original value of n // 2, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).**
