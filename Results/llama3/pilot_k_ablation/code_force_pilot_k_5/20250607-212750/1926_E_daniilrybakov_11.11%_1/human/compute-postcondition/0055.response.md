To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `s` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `s` is less than `k`. Right before the loop, `s` is `(n_back + 1) // 2` and `k` is the value of `k` from stdin.

To guarantee that the loop can execute at least once, we need to ensure that `s` is indeed less than `k`. Since `s` is calculated as `(n_back + 1) // 2`, we can infer that `n_back` must be less than `2k - 1` to make `s` less than `k`.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 2, `_` is 2, `m` is 1, `n` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `n_back` is less than `2k - 1`, `s` is `(n_back + 1) // 2`, `k` is the value of `k` from stdin, stdin contains `t - x - 4` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k` (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**
