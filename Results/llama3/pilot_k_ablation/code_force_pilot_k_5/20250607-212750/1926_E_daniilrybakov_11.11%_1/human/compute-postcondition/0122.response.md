Postcondition: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 4, _ is 4, m is 8, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 + 1, if n is 0, then s is equal to n_back and n is 1. Otherwise, s is less than k and n is (n_back + 1) // 4 // 4. stdin contains t - x - 6 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, is being printed.**
