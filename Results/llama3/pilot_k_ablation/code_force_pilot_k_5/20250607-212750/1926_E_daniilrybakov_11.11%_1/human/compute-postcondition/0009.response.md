Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), s is n_back, n is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `s` is set to the value of `n_back`, and the value of `n` is set to 1. The value of `t` and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `_` is still 0. The break statement does not affect the values of any variables.
