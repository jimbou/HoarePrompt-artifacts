Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 4, n is 1, s is n_back, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**

The code snippet assigns the value of `n_back` to `s` and sets `n` to 1. The `break` statement does not affect the variables' values. The initial state's conditions for `t`, `_`, `m`, `k`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The values of `n` and `s` are updated according to the code, and their new values are reflected in the output state.
