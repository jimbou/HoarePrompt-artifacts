The variable in the loop head is s and k, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables s and k. If s is less than k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, s is (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is the value of k from stdin. For the loop to be executed one more time s must be less than k, so s must be less than k and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 2, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, n is (n_back + 1) // 4, s is (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and s is less than k, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**
