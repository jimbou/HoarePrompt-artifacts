The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, `_` is 3, m is 2^x, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m, where k is the value of k from stdin, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, and m is 2^x**
