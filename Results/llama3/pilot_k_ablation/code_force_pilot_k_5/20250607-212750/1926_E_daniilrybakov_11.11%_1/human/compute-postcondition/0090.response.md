According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is greater than or equal to its original value and `k` is greater than `s`. `k` being greater than `s` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 3, _ is 3, m is 4, k is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, if n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back. Otherwise, the values of n and s remain unchanged. In both cases, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), n is an integer and n is less than or equal to its original value, s is an integer and s is greater than or equal to its original value and k is greater than s**
