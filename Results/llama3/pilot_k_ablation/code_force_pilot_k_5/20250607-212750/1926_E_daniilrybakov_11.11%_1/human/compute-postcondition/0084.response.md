Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 3, `_` is 3, `m` is 1, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and `k` is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains `t - x - 5` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k` (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), if `n` is 0, then `n` is set to 1 and `s` is set to `n_back`, otherwise `n` is either 0 or the value of `n` from the initial state divided by 2, and `s` is either `n_back` or the value of `s` from the initial state plus `n`, and `s` must be less than `k`***
