Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n_back is n, s is n, n is 1, m is 1, and k must be greater than (n + 1) // 2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `_` also remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The contents of `stdin` remain the same as the code does not read or modify its contents. The value of `n_back` is updated to be equal to the original value of `n`, which is `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `s` is updated to be equal to `n_back`, which is also `(n + 1) // 2`. The value of `n` is updated to be 1. The value of `m` remains 1 as it is not modified by the code. The constraint on `k` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
