To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to examine the condition `s < k`. The loop will execute if `s` is indeed less than `k`. Given the state right before the loop, we have:

- `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 0.
- `_` is 0.
- `stdin` contains `t - 1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9).
- `n_back` is `n`.
- `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `n` is `(n + 1) // 2`.
- `m` is 1.

The variables in the loop head are `s` and `k`. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust their states so that `s < k` is true.

Given that `s` is `(n + 1) // 2` and `k` is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), for `s` to be less than `k`, `k` must be greater than `(n + 1) // 2`. Since `n` is also `(n + 1) // 2`, we can say that `n` must be greater than its current value to ensure `s < k`. However, since `n` is already defined as `(n + 1) // 2`, we need to ensure that the initial value of `n` (before it was set to `(n + 1) // 2`) was such that `(n + 1) // 2` is less than `k`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is that `k` must be greater than `(n + 1) // 2`, where `n` is `(n + 1) // 2`. This implies that the initial value of `n` must have been such that its half (rounded up) is less than `k`.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains `t - 1` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), `n_back` is `n`, `s` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `n` is `(n + 1) // 2`, `m` is 1, and `k` must be greater than `(n + 1) // 2`**
