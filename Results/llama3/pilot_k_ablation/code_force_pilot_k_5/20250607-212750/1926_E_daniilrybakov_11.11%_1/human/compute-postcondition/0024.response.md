Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, m is 2^x, n is greater than or equal to 1 and is half of its original value, s is ((n + 1) // 2) + ((n + 1) // 4) + n if n is greater than or equal to 2, otherwise s is n_back + 1 + n and s must be less than k - x + 1, k is greater than (n + 1) // 2 and k must be greater than s, stdin contains t - x lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1, s is set to n_back + 1, and k remains greater than (n + 1) // 2 and greater than s.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed x times, where x is a positive integer. The value of m has been doubled x times, and the value of n has been halved x times. The value of s has been updated accordingly, and it is less than k - x + 1. The value of k remains greater than (n + 1) // 2 and greater than s. The stdin contains t - x lines, each containing two integers n and k. If n is 0, then n is set to 1, s is set to n_back + 1, and k remains greater than (n + 1) // 2 and greater than s.
