To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`.

The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the range.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, and `t` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 4.

The state of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 4, `_` is 4, `m` is 2^x, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and k is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, `n` is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2^x, `s` is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, and s is greater than or equal to k, stdin contains t - x - 5 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), and a multiple of 2^x, where the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1, is being printed**
