Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 8, if n is 0, then n is 0, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, k is greater than the original value of n plus half of the original value of n, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). Otherwise, the values of n, n_back, s, and k remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been doubled to 8. The value of `n` has been halved, and if it was originally 0, it remains 0. The value of `s` has been incremented by half of the original value of `n`. The values of `t`, `_`, `n_back`, and `k` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing `t - x - 2` lines, each with two integers `n_back` and `k`.
