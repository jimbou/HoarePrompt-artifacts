Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 8, n is 1, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of the original value of n_back, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been changed to 1, and the value of `s` has been updated to be equal to the original value of `n_back`. The values of `t`, `_`, `m`, `n_back`, and `k` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing `t - x - 2` lines, each with two integers `n_back` and `k`.
