To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `s < k`. The loop will execute if `s` is less than `k`. Given the initial states:

- `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 3
- `_` is 3
- `m` is 1
- `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and `k` is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4
- stdin contains `t - x - 5` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k` (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)
- `n` is either 0 or the value of `n` from the initial state divided by 2
- `s` is either `n_back` or the value of `s` from the initial state plus `n`

We need to adjust the states of `s` and `k` to ensure `s < k`.

Given that `k` is already constrained to be greater than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4`, which implies `k` is at least more than half of `n_back` plus a quarter of `n_back`, we need to ensure `s` does not exceed this value to guarantee the loop can execute.

Since `s` can be either `n_back` or the value of `s` from the initial state plus `n`, and considering `n` can be 0 or the initial value of `n` divided by 2, we need to ensure that `s` does not exceed `k` in any case.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure `s` is less than `k`. Given the constraints on `k` and the possible values of `s`, we can conclude that `s` must be less than `k` for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 3, `_` is 3, `m` is 1, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and `k` is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains `t - x - 5` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k` (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), `n` is either 0 or the value of `n` from the initial state divided by 2, and `s` is either `n_back` or the value of `s` from the initial state plus `n`, and `s` must be less than `k`**
