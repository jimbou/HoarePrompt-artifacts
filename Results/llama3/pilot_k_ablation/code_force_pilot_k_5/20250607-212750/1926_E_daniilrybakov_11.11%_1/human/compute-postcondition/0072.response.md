According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s` and `k`. If `s` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is either `n_back` or the value of `s` from the initial state plus `n`, and `k` is an integer greater than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4` and `k` is greater than `s`. `k` being greater than `s` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than `s` and `s` is less than `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 16, k is an integer greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s and k is greater than s, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n and s is less than k, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9)**
