Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and `t` is greater than 3, `_` is 3, `m` is 1, `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9) and `k` is greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains `t - x - 5` lines, each containing two integers `n_back` and `k` (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9), `n` is 0, and `s` is `n_back`***
