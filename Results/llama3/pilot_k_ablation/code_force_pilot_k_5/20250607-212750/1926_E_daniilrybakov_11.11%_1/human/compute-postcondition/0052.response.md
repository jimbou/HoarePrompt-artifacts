The code prints the result of the expression `(2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m`. 

Here, `k` is greater than the original value of `n_back` plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, `s` is equal to the original value of `n_back` plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, `n` is greater than or equal to 0 and is 1 / 2^x of its original value, and `m` is 2^x.

Output: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 1, _ is 1, m is 2^x, n is greater than or equal to 0 and is 1 / 2^x of its original value, n_back is the original value of n, s is equal to the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, k is greater than the original value of n_back plus half of its original value plus half of its original value plus ... (x - 1) times half of its original value, stdin contains t - x - 2 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1. Otherwise, n is 1 / 2^x of its original value, and this is printed: (2 * (k - (s - n)) - 1) * m**
