Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 4, k is the value of k from stdin and k must be greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9). If n is 0, then n is set to 1 and s is set to n_back, otherwise n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, and s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n. In both cases, s must be less than k and s must be less than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, and k must be greater than s.***
