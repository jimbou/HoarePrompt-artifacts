Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 16, k is an integer greater than (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4 and k is greater than s, n is either 0 or the value of n from the initial state divided by 2, s is either n_back or the value of s from the initial state plus n, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).**

The code multiplies `m` by 2, making it 16. It then divides `n` by 2, making it either 0 or half of its original value. Finally, it adds `n` to `s`, updating its value. The values of `t`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t - x - 4` lines, each with two integers `n_back` and `k`. The conditions on `k`, `n`, and `s` are still valid, ensuring that `k` is greater than `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4` and `s`, and that `s` is less than `k` and `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4`.
