Postcondition: ***t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 0, _ is 0, stdin contains t - 1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^9), n_back is n, if n is 0, then s is n, n is 1, and m is 1. Otherwise, s is (n + 1) // 2, n is (n + 1) // 2, and m is 1. In both cases, k must be greater than (n + 1) // 2.***
