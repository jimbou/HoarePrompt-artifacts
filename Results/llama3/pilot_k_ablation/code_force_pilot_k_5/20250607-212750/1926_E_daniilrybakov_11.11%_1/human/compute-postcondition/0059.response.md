Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 5 * 10^4) and t is greater than 2, _ is 2, m is 2, k is the value of k from stdin, n is (n_back + 1) // 4, s is (n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4, stdin contains t - x - 4 lines, each containing two integers n_back and k (1 <= k <= n_back <= 10^9).**

In this output state, the value of `m` has been doubled to 2. The value of `n` has been halved to `(n_back + 1) // 4`. The value of `s` has been incremented by the new value of `n`, making it `(n_back + 1) // 2 + (n_back + 1) // 4`. The values of `t`, `_`, and `k` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` remains the same, containing `t - x - 4` lines, each with two integers `n_back` and `k`.
