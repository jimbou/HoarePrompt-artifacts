This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. It then calculates and prints a multiple of 2^x, where x is a non-negative integer, and the multiple is less than or equal to 2 * k - 1. The function repeats this process for each test case, and once all test cases have been processed, it terminates, leaving the standard input empty.
