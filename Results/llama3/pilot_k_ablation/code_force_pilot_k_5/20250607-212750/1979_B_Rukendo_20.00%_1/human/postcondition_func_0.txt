This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two distinct non-negative integers. For each test case, it converts the integers to binary, compares them from the most significant bit, and prints the number of equal bits from the start (2 to the power of the number of equal bits). The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the input stream empty.
