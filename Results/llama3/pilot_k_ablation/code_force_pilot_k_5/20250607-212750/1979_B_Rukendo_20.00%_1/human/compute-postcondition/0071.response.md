Output State: **t is at least 0, x is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer and x currently must be not equal to zero, y is an integer and equals x multiplied by 8, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2 four times, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still being at least 0. The value of `x` is now a non-zero integer divided by 8, and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer. Additionally, `x` is currently not equal to zero. The value of `y` is still an integer and equals `x` multiplied by 8. The list `l1` now contains the remainder of `x` divided by 2 four times. The list `l2` remains empty. The values of `n`, `i`, and `cnt` remain unchanged, still being 1, 1, and 0, respectively. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
