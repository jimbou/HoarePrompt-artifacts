Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, x is the first integer from the input, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is an empty list, and l2 is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, x is not equal to 0 and is now divided by 2, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0, x is divisible by 2 and x is greater than or equal to 0, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0, x is divisible by 2 and x is greater than 0, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing two identical elements equal to the remainder of x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is greater than 0, x is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value divided by 2, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing three elements: two identical elements equal to the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is greater than 0, x is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value divided by 4 and the original value of x must have been greater than 0 and even, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing four elements: three identical elements equal to the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of the original x divided by 4, and l2 is an empty list.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
