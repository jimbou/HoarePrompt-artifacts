Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The element at index `i` of `l1` is not equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`.***
