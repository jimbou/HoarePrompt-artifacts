Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is an integer, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is an empty list, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is: the value of x becomes 0, the list l1 contains the binary representation of the original value of x, and the other variables remain unchanged.
