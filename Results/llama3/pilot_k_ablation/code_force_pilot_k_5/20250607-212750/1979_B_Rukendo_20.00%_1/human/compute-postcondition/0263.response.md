The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time y must be an odd integer, because only then y divided by 2 will be a non-zero integer.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is an odd integer, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2.**
