Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 0, x is 0, y is an integer and equals the original x multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of iterations, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is an empty list, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 0, x is 0, y is a non-zero integer equal to half of its original value, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing one additional element which is the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is at least 0, x is 0, y is a non-zero integer equal to half of its original value and greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing two additional elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is at least 0, x is 0, y is at least 1 and equal to half of its original value, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing three elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is at least 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and equal to half of its original value divided by 2, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing four elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is at least 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and its original value is greater than 4 but now is half of its original value, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing five elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
