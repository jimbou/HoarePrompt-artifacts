Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 2 if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 1, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `cnt`, `i`, `n`, `l1`, and `l2` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
