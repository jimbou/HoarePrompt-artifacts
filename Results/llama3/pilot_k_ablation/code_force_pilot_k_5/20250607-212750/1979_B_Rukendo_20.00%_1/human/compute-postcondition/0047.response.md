To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and adjust their states accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the only variable that can be adjusted is `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at some value (not specified), and `n` is greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state of `i` is `i + 1`.

The other variables in the state (`t`, `stdin`, `x`, `y`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, and `cnt`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1, i is i + 1**
