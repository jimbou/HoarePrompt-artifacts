Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, cnt is 0, `i` is 0,  `n` must be greater than 0. The current value of l1[i] is equal to the current value of l2[i].**
