According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1. 

State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated non-negative integers x and y such that x != y.**
