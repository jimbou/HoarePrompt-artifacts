Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x with an additional 0 at the end, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original y, the length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1, and the current length of l1 is less than or equal to the length of l2.**

In this output state, the value of l1 has been updated by appending a 0 to the end of the list. The length of l1 is now equal to or one more than its original length, but it is still less than or equal to the length of l2. The other variables remain unchanged.
