Output State: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0 and 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The length of l2 is greater than the length of l1**

The code appends 0 to the list l1, which originally contained the binary representation of 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of l1 is now one more than its original length, but it is still less than the length of l2.
