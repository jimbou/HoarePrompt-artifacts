Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, cnt is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 0. If the current value of l1[i] is equal to the current value of l2[i], cnt is 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1. If the current value of l1[i] is equal to the current value of l2[i], cnt is 2. Otherwise, cnt is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1. If l1[i] is equal to l2[i], then i is increased by 2 and cnt is increased by 1. If l1[i] is not equal to l2[i], then i is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1, i is 1. If l1[i] is equal to l2[i], cnt is increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `x != y` is false, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representation of the original `x` and `y` respectively, `n` is the length of `l1` which is equal to the length of `l2` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
