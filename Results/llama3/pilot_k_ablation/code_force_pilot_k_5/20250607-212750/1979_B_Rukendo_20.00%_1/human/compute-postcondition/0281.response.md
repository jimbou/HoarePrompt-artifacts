Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the length of `l1`, `i` is -1, `n` is equal to the length of `l2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The current value of `l2` has a length less than the length of `l1`.**

The code changes the value of `n` to be equal to the length of `l2`, which is less than the length of `l1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
