According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value. Since y is a quarter of its original value, the original y must be greater than 4. So for the loop to be executed one more time the original y needed to have been equal or greater than 4 and y currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value and the original y is greater than 4, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.**
