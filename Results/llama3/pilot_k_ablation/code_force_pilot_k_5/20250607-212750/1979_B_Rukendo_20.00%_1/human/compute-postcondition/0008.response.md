Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is greater than 0 and is half its original value, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing three elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, and the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, l2 is an empty list**

Explanation: The first line appends the remainder of x divided by 2 to l1. Since x is greater than 0, this remainder is either 0 or 1. The second line performs integer division of x by 2, effectively halving its value. This means x is now half its original value. The value of y remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The list l1 now contains three elements: the original remainder of x divided by 2, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution (which is the same as the original remainder), and the new remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution. The list l2 remains empty as it is not modified by the code.
