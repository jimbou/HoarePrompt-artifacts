Output: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1. Otherwise, the values of l1 and l2 remain unchanged, and 2 raised to the power of n is being printed**
