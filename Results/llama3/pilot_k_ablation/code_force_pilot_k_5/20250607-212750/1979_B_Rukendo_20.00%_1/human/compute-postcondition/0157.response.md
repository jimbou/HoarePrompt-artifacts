Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the length of `l2`, `i` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`. `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of `l2`, which is less than the length of `l1`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
