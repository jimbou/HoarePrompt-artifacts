Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is not equal to 0 and is now divided by 2, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 to the list `l1`. Since `x` is not equal to 0, the remainder will be either 0 or 1. The second line performs integer division of `x` by 2, effectively dividing `x` by 2 and discarding the remainder. 

The values of `t`, `y`, `cnt`, `i`, and `l2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `x` is modified by the second line, and the list `l1` is modified by the first line. The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
