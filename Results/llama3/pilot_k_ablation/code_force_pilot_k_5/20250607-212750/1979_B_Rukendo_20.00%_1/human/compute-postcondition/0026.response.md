Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `x != y` is false, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `x`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original `y` and has an additional element 0 appended to it, and the length of `l2` is less than or equal to the length of `l1`.**

In this output state, the value of `l2` has been updated by appending an additional element 0 to it. The length of `l2` is now one more than its original length, but it is still less than or equal to the length of `l1`. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `x != y`, and `l1` remain unchanged.
