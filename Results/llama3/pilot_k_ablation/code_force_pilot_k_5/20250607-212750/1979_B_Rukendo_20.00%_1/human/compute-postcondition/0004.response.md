Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list**

Explanation: The first line appends the remainder of x divided by 2 to l1. Since x is a positive integer, the remainder will be either 0 or 1. The second line performs integer division of x by 2, effectively dividing x by 2 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. The value of x is updated to this new value. The other variables, t, stdin, y, and l2, remain unchanged.
