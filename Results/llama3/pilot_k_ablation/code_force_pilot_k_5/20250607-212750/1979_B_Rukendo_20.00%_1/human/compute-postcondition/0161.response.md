Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0. Otherwise, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`. The current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.***
