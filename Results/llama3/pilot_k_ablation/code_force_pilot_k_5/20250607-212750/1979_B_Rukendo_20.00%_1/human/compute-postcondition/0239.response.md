Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than `n+1`, `i` is `n+2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then `cnt` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, `i`, `l1`, and `l2` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
