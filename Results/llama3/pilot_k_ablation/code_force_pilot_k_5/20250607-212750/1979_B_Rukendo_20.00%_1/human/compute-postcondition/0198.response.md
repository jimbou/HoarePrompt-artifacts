Output State: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of x becomes 0, and the list l1 contains the complete binary representation of the original value of x. The other variables remain unchanged.
