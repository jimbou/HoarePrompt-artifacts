Output State: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable y becomes 0, and the list l2 contains the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by powers of 2 (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.) until y is reduced to 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
