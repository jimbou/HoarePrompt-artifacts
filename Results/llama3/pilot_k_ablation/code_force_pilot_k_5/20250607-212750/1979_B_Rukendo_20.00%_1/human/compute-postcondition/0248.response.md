The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be greater than 0. So, t is decreased by 1.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1. Otherwise, the values of l1 and l2 remain unchanged, and 2 raised to the power of n is being printed**
