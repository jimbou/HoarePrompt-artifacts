Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, cnt is 0, if the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, n is equal to the length of l2, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1. Otherwise, the values of l1 and l2 remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if l1[i] == l2[i]:
        cnt += 1
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then `cnt` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than `n`, `i` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then `cnt` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than `n+1`, `i` is `n+2`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then `cnt` is 4. Otherwise, `cnt` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than `n+2`, `i` is `n+3`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then `cnt` is either 5 or 4 and we don't break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `cnt` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
