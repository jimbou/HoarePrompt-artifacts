Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `x != y` is false, `l1` and `l2` are lists containing the binary representation of the original `x` and `y` respectively, `n` is the length of `l1` which is equal to the length of `l2` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` has been increased by 1. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
