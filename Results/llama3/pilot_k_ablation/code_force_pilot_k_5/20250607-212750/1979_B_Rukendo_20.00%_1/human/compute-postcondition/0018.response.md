The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than 0 and is an odd number divided by 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time y must be greater than 0.
State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 and the remainder of the original y divided by 2**
