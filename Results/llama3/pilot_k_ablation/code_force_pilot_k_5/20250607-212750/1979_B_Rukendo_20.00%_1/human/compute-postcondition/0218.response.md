Output State: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, n is equal to the length of l1, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, the current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1. If the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0 and 0, and the length of l2 is greater than the length of l1. Otherwise, the values of l1 and l2 remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of n is now equal to the length of l1. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
