Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 2, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2.**

The code first appends the remainder of y divided by 2 to l2, then performs integer division of y by 2. The value of y is updated to be its original value divided by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
