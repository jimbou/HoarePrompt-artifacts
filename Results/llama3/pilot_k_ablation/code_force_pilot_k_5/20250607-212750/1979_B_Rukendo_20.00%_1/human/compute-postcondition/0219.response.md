Postcondition: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, n is equal to the length of l1, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1.**
