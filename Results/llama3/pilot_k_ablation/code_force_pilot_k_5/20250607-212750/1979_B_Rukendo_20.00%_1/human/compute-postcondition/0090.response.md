Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is the number of iterations, `i` is the number of iterations, `cnt` is 0, the length of `l2` is larger than or equal to the length of `l1`, and the current value of the length of `l1` is equal to the length of `l2`, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `l1` has been updated by appending 0 to it, which makes the length of `l1` equal to the length of `l2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
