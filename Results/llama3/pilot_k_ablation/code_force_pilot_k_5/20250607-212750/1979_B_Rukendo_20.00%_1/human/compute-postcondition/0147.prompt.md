Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is an integer, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is an empty list, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is not equal to 0 and is now y divided by 2, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and y is half of its original value, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and y is a quarter of its original value and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and y is a quarter of its original value and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one and the original value of y needed to have been greater than 4
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
