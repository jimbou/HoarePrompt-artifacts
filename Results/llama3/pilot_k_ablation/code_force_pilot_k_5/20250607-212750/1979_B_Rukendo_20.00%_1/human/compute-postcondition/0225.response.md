Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. The current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships.
