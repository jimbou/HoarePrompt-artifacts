Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value, y is an integer, l1 contains five elements: the original three elements, the remainder of the original value of x divided by 2, and the remainder of half of the original value of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

Explanation:

* The first line appends the remainder of x divided by 2 to l1. Since x is half of its original value, the remainder is either 0 or 1. This adds a new element to l1, making it contain five elements.
* The second line performs integer division of x by 2, effectively dividing x by 2 and rounding down to the nearest integer. Since x is already half of its original value, this operation makes x a quarter of its original value.

All other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the updated values of x and l1.
