Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The lists `l1` and `l2` still contain the binary representation of the first and second integers from the input, respectively, with the same length relationship as before. Additionally, the condition `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]` remains true. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
