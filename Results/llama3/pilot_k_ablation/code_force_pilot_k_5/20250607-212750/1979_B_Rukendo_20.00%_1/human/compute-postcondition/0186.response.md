The only variable in the loop head is variable  `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0. Otherwise, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is `n` and we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt is printed**
