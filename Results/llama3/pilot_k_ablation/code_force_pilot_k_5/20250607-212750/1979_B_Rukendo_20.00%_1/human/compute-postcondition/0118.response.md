Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is either 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0, 1, or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
