The value of `cnt` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `cnt` is 0, so the value of `cnt` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `l1[i]` is still equal to the value of `l2[i]`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The value of `t` is still at least 0, `x` is still 0, `y` is still 0, `n` is still at least 1, and `i` is still 0.

Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `cnt` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**
