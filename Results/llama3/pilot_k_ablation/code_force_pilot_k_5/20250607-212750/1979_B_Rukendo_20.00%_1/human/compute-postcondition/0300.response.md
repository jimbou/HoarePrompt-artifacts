Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 3 if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `cnt`, `i`, `n`, `l1`, and `l2` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The length of `l1` and `l2` is still either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, the current value of `l1[i]` is still equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
