Output State: **t is at least 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and equal to half of its original value divided by 2, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing four elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of y has been divided by 2, and the remainder of y divided by 2 has been appended to list l2. The other variables remain unchanged.
