Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value divided by 2, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing three elements: two identical elements equal to the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.**

In this final state, the value of `x` has been divided by 2, and the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 has been appended to `l1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
