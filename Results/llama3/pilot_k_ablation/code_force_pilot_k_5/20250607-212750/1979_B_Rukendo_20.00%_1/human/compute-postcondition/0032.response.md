Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, an additional element 0 is appended to l2. Otherwise, if the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, an additional 0 is appended to the end of l1, otherwise no changes are made to l1. n is the length of l1.**

In this output state, the value of n is the length of l1, which is the length of the binary representation of the original x. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions regarding the lengths of l1 and l2 and the appended elements are still valid.
