Output State: **t is 0, stdin contains no test cases, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false, l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the last x and y respectively, n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, i is n, cnt is the number of equal elements from the start of l1 and l2, and 2 to the power of cnt has been printed for all test cases.**

This output state means that the loop has finished executing all the iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The value of t has been decremented to 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The stdin contains no more test cases, and the values of x and y are 0, indicating that all input has been consumed. The lists l1 and l2 contain the binary representation of the last x and y values respectively, and their lengths are equal. The variable n is equal to the length of l1 (and l2), and the variable i is equal to n, indicating that the loop has finished iterating over the lists. The variable cnt contains the number of equal elements from the start of l1 and l2, and the value of 2 to the power of cnt has been printed for all test cases.
