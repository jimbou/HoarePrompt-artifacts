Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, n is equal to the length of l2, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1. Otherwise, the values of l1 and l2 remain unchanged.***
