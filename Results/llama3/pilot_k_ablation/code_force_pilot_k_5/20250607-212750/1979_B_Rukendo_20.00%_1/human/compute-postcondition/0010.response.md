Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing four elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been halved due to the integer division operation `x //= 2`. The list `l1` now contains four elements, with the last element being the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2, which was appended by the first line of the code. The other elements in `l1` remain unchanged. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
