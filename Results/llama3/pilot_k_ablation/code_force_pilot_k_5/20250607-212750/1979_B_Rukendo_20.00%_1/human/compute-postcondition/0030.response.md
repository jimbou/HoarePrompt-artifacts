Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original y, and the length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1. If the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, an additional 0 is appended to the end of l1, otherwise no changes are made to l1.***
