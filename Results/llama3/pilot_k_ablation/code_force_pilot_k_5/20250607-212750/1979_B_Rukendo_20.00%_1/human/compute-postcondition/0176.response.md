Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0. Otherwise, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The lists `l1` and `l2` are still defined based on the original values of `x` and `y`, respectively. However, we now break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
