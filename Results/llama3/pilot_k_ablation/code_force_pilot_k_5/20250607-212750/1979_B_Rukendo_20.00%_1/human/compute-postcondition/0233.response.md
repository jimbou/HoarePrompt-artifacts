The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n`, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than `n`, `i` is `n+1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then `cnt` is 2. Otherwise, `cnt` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
