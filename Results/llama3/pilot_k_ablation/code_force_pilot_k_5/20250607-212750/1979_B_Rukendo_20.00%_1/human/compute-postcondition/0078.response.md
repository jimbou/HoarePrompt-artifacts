Output State: **t is at least 0, x is 0, y is a non-zero integer equal to half of its original value and greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing two additional elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of y has been halved, and the remainder of y divided by 2 has been appended to list l2. All other variables remain unchanged.
