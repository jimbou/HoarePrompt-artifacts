Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 2, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is 2 and `i` is 1. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
