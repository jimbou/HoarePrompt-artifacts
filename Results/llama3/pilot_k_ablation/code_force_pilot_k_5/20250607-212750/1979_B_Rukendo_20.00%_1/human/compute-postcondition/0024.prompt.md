Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is an empty list
Code of the loop:
while y:
    l2.append(y % 2)
    y //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is the integer part of y divided by 2, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is an odd number divided by 2, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 and the remainder of the original y divided by 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is the integer division of its original value by 2, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is the integer division of its original value by 8, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is the integer division of its original value by 16, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, and the original value of y is greater than 8


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
