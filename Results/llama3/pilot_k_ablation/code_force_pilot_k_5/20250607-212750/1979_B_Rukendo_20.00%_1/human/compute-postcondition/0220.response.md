Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is equal to the length of `l2`, `i` is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be equal to the length of `l2`, which is the same as the length of `l1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The lists `l1` and `l2` also remain unchanged.
