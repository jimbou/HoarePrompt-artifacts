Output State: **t is at least 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, x != y is false, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, i is n, cnt is the number of equal elements from the start of l1 and l2, and 2 to the power of cnt is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**.

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y. This changes the values of x and y, but does not affect any other variables. The second and third lines create two empty lists, l1 and l2, which does not affect any other variables. The rest of the code does not execute, as it is not provided. Therefore, the final state includes the updated values of x and y, the creation of l1 and l2, and the remaining test cases in stdin.
