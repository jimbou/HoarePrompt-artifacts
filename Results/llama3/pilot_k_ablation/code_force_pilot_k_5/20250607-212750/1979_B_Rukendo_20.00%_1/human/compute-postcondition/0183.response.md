Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0. Otherwise, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is `n` and we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is that `t` is still greater than 0, `x` and `y` are still 0, and `n` is still greater than or equal to itself. The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated `n` times. The state of `l1` and `l2` remains unchanged, with `l2` possibly having an extra 0 at the end if its length is less than `l1`, and `l1` possibly having an extra 0 if its length is less than `l2`. The value of `cnt` is either `n` if all iterations were successful, or 0 if the loop broke out early.
