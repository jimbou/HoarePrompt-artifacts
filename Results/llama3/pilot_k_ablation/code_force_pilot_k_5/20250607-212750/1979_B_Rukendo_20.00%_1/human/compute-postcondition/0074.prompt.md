Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 0, x is an integer, y is an integer, x != y is false, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, i is n, cnt is the number of equal elements from the start of l1 and l2, and 2 to the power of cnt is being printed, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 0, x is a non-zero integer divided by 2, y is an integer and equals x multiplied by 2, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is at least 0, x is a non-zero integer divided by 4 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer, y is an integer and equals x multiplied by 4, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2 twice, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is at least 0, x is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer, y is an integer and equals x multiplied by 8, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2 three times, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is at least 0, x is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer and x currently must be not equal to zero, y is an integer and equals x multiplied by 8, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2 four times, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is at least 0, x is at least 0, y is an integer and equals the original x multiplied by 8, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 five times, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
