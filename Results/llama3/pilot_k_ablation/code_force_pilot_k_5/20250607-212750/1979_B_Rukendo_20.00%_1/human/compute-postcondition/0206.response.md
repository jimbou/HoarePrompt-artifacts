Output State: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is the original value of y divided by 8, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 4 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2**

The code appends the remainder of y divided by 2 to l2 and then performs integer division of y by 2. This means that y is effectively divided by 8 (since it was already divided by 4 in the initial state), and l2 now contains the binary representation of the original value of y plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 4 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2.
