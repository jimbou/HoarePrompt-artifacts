Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1. If l1[i] is equal to l2[i], then i is increased by 2 and cnt is increased by 1. If l1[i] is not equal to l2[i], then i is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
