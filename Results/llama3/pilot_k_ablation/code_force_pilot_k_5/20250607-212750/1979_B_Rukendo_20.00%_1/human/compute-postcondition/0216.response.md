Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, if the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0 and 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The length of l2 is greater than the length of l1. Otherwise, the values of l1 and l2 remain unchanged.***
