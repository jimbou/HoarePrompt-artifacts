Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1, i is i + 2, cnt is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `cnt` is increased by 1, the value of `i` is increased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one. The binary representation of x and y are still stored in l1 and l2 respectively, and the length of l1 and l2 is still greater than 1.
