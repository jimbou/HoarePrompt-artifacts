Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is equal to `n`, `i` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input with an additional 0 at the end, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l2` is larger than or equal to the length of `l1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `x` and `y` are still 0, `cnt` is still equal to `n`, and `i` is still -1. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed. The list `l1` now contains the binary representation of the first integer from the input with an additional 0 appended to the end. The list `l2` remains unchanged, containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l2` is now larger than or equal to the length of `l1` because `l1` has been extended by one element.
