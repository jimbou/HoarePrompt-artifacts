Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is not equal to 0 and is now y divided by 2, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of y has been updated to be y divided by 2, and the list l2 now contains the remainder of y divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
