The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is a non-zero integer equal to half of its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time y must be greater than 1.
State: **t is at least 0, x is 0, y is a non-zero integer equal to half of its original value and greater than 1, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing one additional element which is the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
