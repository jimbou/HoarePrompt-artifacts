Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list**

The first line reads two space-separated non-negative integers from stdin and assigns them to x and y, respectively. Since each test case contains two such integers and x != y, x and y will be assigned these values. The second line initializes two empty lists, l1 and l2. No other variables are affected.
