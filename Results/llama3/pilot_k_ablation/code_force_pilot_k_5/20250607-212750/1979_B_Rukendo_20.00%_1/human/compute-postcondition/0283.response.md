Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `i` is -1, `n` is equal to the length of `l2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The length of `l1` and `l2` is still either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
