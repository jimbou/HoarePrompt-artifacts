Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value and the original y is greater than 1, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.**

In this final state, the value of `y` has been halved twice, resulting in a quarter of its original value. The list `l2` has been appended with the remainder of the new `y` divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
