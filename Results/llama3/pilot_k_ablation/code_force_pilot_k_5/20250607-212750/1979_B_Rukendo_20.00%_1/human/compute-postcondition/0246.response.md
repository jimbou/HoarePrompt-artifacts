The code prints the value of 2 raised to the power of `cnt`, where `cnt` is equal to `n`. Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `2 ** cnt`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated value.

Output: **2^n (where n is the value of n)**
