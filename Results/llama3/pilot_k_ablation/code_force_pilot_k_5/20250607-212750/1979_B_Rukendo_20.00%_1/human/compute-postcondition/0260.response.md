Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is equal to 0, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is an empty list.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t is greater than 0, x is equal to 0, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is an empty list.
