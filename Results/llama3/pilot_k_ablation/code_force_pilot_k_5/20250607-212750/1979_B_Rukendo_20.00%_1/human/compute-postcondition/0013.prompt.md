Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is a non-negative integer, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is a positive integer equal to its original value divided by 2, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is at least 0, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing two elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2 and the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, l2 is an empty list
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is greater than 0 and is half its original value, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing three elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, and the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, l2 is an empty list
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing four elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, and the remainder of the original x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing five elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, l2 is an empty list


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
