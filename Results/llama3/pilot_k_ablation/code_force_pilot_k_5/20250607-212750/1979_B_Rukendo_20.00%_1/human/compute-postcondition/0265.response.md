According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is an integer, So for the loop to be executed one more time y must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2, and the remainder of the original y divided by 2.**
