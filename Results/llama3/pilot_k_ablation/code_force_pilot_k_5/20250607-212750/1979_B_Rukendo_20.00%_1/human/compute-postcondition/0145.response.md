Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code appends the remainder of y divided by 2 to l2 and then performs integer division of y by 2. Since y is a quarter of its original value and the original value of y was greater than 4, y is greater than 1. After the code executes, y is still greater than 0. The remainder of y divided by 2 is 1, so l2 now contains four 1s. The other variables are not affected by the code.
