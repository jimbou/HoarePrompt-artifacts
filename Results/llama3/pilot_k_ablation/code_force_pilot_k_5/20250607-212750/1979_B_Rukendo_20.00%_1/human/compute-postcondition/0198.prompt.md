Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y.
Code of the loop:
while x:
    l1.append(x % 2)
    x //= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 2, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x followed by the least significant bit of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 4 and x currently must be greater than 0, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x followed by the two least significant bits of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 8 and x currently must be greater than 0, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x followed by the three least significant bits of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is greater than 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 16 and x currently must be greater than 0, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x followed by the three least significant bits of the original value of x and the least significant bit of the original value of x divided by 8, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is greater than 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 32 and x currently must be greater than 0 and x must be greater than 0, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x followed by the three least significant bits of the original value of x and the least significant bit of the original value of x divided by 8 and the least significant bit of the original value of x divided by 16, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
