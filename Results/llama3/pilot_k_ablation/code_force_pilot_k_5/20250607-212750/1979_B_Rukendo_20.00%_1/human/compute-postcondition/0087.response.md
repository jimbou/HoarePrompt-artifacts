Output State: **t is at least 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 for each iteration and 0, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The current value of the length of l2 is less than or equal to the length of l1.**

The code appends 0 to the list l2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The length of l2 is increased by 1, but it is still less than or equal to the length of l1.
