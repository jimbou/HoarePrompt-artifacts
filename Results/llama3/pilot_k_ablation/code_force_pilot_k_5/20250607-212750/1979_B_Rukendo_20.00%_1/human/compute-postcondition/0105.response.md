Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 2, `cnt` is 2, `i` is 1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The program is still inside the loop or if statement, and `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
