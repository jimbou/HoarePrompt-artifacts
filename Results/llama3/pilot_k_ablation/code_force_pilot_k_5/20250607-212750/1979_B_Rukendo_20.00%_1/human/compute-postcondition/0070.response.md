The variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be a non-zero integer divided by 8 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer and x currently must be not equal to zero.
State: **t is at least 0, x is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer and x currently must be not equal to zero, y is an integer and equals x multiplied by 8, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2 three times, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
