Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The length of `l2` is less than or equal to the length of `l1`, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. Otherwise, the length of `l2` is larger than or equal to the length of `l1`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0. Otherwise, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of `l1`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions regarding the lengths and contents of `l1` and `l2` are still valid, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
