Output State: t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the variable y becomes 0, and the list l2 contains the binary representation of the original value of y. The other variables remain unchanged.
