Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 3 if `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, `cnt` is now 3, otherwise it is 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the same loop or if statement, but if `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, the loop or if statement is exited.
