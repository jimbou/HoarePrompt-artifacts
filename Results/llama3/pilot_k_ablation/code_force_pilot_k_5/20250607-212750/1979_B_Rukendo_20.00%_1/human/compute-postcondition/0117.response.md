Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 5, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is either 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 1, 2, or 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` can be 3, 4, or 5. If `l1[i]` is not equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` can be 1, 2, or 3, and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the other variables remain the same.
