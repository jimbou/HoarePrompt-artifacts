Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `cnt` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `l1`, `l2`, and `n` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 1, and the value of `cnt` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether the current values of `l1[i]` and `l2[i]` are equal. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
