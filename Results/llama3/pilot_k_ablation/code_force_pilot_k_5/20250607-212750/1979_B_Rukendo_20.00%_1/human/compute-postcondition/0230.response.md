Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. `cnt` is 2 if the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, otherwise `cnt` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2 if the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, otherwise it is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
