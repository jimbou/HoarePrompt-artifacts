Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1, i is i + 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is at least 1, the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one, `x` and `y` are still 0 and are equal, `l1` and `l2` still contain the binary representation of the original `x` and `y` respectively, `n` is still greater than 1 and is the length of both `l1` and `l2`, `i` is incremented by 1, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
