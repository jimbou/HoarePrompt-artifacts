The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is the original value of y divided by 4, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original value of y needed to have been greater than 0 and y currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is the original value of y divided by 4 and y currently must be greater than 0, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2 plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 4**
