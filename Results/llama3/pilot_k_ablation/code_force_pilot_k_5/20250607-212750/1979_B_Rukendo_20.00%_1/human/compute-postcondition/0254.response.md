The variable in the loop head is x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is divisible by 2 and x is greater than or equal to 0. x being greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to x is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is divisible by 2 and x is greater than 0, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.**
