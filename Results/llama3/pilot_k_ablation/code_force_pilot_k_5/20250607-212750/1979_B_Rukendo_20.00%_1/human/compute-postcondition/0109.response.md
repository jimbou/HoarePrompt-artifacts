Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 3, `cnt` is either 1 or 2 or 3, `i` is 2 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
