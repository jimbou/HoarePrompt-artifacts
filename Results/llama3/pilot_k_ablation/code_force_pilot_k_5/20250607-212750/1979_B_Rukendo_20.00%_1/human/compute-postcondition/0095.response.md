Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is the length of `l2`, `i` is the number of iterations, `cnt` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of `l2`, which is less than the length of `l1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
