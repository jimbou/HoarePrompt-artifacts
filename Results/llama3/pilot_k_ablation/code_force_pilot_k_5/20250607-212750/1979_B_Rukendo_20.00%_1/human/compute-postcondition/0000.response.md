Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated non-negative integers x and y such that x != y.**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of stdin, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each containing two space-separated non-negative integers x and y such that x != y.
