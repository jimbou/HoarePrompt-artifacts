Postcondition: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively. The length of l2 is less than the length of l1. An additional element 0 is appended to l2. n is the length of l1.**
