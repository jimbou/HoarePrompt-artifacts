According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is greater than 0 and is half its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time, x must be greater than 0.
State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is greater than 0, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing three elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, and the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, l2 is an empty list**
