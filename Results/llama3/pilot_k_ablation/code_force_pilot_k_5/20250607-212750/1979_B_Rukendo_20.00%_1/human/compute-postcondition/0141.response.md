Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and y is a quarter of its original value and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the remainder of y divided by 2 to l2. Since y is greater than 0 and y is half of its original value, y is currently an odd number, so the remainder of y divided by 2 is 1. The second line performs integer division of y by 2, effectively halving y. Since y is greater than 0 and y is half of its original value, y is currently greater than 0, so y becomes a quarter of its original value. No other variables are affected.
