Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated non-negative integers x and y such that x != y.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    l1, l2 = [], []
    while x:
        l1.append(x % 2)
        x //= 2
    while y:
        l2.append(y % 2)
        y //= 2
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        l2.append(0)
    elif len(l1) < len(l2):
        l1.append(0)
    n = len(l1)
    if len(l2) < len(l1):
        n = len(l2)
    cnt = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if l1[i] == l2[i]:
            cnt += 1
        else:
            break
    print(2 ** cnt)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the number of equal elements from the start of `l1` and `l2`, and 2 to the power of cnt is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is the length of the shorter list between `l1` and `l2`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and 2 raised to the power of `cnt` is printed, where `cnt` is the number of iterations for which `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]` for all `i` in range `n`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0. Otherwise, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is `n` and we do not break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is 0, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus all the remainders of the original value of y divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of y is reduced to 0. The current value of l2 has the same number of elements as the current value of l1. Otherwise, the values of l1 and l2 remain unchanged, and 2 raised to the power of n is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the number of matching elements in `l1` and `l2` from the start, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is equal to the length of `l2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt which is the number of matching elements in `l1` and `l2` from the start is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
