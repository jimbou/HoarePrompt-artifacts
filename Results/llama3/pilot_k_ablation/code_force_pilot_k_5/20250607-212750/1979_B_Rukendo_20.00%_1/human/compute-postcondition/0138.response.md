According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is not equal to 0 and is now y divided by 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, y must be greater than 1 and y divided by 2 must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 1 and y divided by 2 is greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
