The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than 0 and is the integer division of its original value by 2. Since y is already greater than 0, no adjustment is needed for y to be not zero. However, we can further specify that y must be greater than 0 and is the integer division of its original value by 4.
State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is the integer division of its original value by 4, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.**
