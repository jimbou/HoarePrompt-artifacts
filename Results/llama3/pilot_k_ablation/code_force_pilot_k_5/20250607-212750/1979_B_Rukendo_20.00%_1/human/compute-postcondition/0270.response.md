Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is an eighth of its original value and the original y is greater than 4, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, the remainder of the new y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.**

The code modifies the value of y and the list l2. The first line appends the remainder of y divided by 2 to l2. Since y is a quarter of its original value, the remainder of y divided by 2 is the same as the remainder of the new y divided by 2. The second line divides y by 2, making it an eighth of its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.
