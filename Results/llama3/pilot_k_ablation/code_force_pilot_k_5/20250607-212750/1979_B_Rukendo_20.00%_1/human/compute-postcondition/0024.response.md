Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original y.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x is not equal to y is false, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original y.
