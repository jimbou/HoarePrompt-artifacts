Postcondition: ***t is at least 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 for each iteration, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1. If the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, then the length of l1 is equal to the length of l2. Otherwise, the length of l1 remains the same.***
