Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input.**

The loop continues to execute until y becomes 0. In each iteration, y is divided by 2 and the remainder is appended to l2. This process continues until y is reduced to 0. At this point, l2 contains the binary representation of the original value of y. The other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
