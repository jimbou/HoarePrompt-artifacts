Output State: **t is at least 0, x is 0, y is an integer and equals the original x multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of iterations, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is an empty list, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable x becomes 0, the variable y becomes the original value of x multiplied by 2 to the power of the number of iterations, the list l1 contains the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, and the number of iterations is stored in the variables n and i. The other variables remain unchanged.
