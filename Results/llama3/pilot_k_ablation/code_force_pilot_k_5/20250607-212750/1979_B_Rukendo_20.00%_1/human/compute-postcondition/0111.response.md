Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
