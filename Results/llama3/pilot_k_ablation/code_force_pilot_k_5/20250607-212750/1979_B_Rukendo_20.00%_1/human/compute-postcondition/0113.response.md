Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `cnt` is either 2, 3, 4, if `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, otherwise `cnt` is either 1, 2, 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, then `cnt` can take values 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `cnt` can take values 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
