The code `n = len(l2)` assigns the length of `l2` to `n`. Since `l2` has an additional element 0 appended to it, its length is now equal to the length of `l1`. Therefore, `n` is now equal to the length of `l1`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false, l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2.**
