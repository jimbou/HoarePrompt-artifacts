The first line appends the remainder of `y` divided by 2 to `l2`. Since `y` is greater than 1 and `y` divided by 2 is greater than 0, the remainder of `y` divided by 2 is 1. So `l2` now contains the remainder of `y` divided by 2, which is 1. The second line performs integer division of `y` by 2, effectively dividing `y` by 2 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. Since `y` is greater than 1 and `y` divided by 2 is greater than 0, `y` becomes `y` divided by 2.

Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and y is half of its original value, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
