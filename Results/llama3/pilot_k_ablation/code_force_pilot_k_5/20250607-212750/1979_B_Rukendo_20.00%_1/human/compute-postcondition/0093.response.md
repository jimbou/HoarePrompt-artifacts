Output State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is the length of `l1`, `i` is the number of iterations, `cnt` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The length of `l2` is either less than or equal to the length of `l1`, or equal to the length of `l1` if the original length of `l2` was larger than the length of `l1`.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be the length of `l1`, which is the number of iterations. The other variables remain unchanged. The length of `l2` is still either less than or equal to the length of `l1`, or equal to the length of `l1` if the original length of `l2` was larger than the length of `l1`.
