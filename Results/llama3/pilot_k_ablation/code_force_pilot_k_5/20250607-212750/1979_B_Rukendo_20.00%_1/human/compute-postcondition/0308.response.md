Output: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is equal to the number of matching elements in `l1` and `l2` from the start, `i` is equal to `n-1`, `n` is equal to the length of `l2`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of 2 raised to the power of cnt which is the number of matching elements in `l1` and `l2` from the start is being printed**
