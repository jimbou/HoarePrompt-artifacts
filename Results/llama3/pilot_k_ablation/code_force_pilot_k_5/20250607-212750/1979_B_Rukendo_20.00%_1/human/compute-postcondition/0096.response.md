Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is the length of the shorter list between `l1` and `l2`, `i` is the number of iterations, `cnt` is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.***
