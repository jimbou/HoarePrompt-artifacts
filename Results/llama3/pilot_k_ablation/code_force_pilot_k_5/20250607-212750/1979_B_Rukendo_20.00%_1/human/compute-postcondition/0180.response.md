Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If the length of `l2` is less than the length of `l1`, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` and an extra 0 at the end. Otherwise, `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`. If the length of `l1` is less than the length of `l2`, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x` plus one 0. Otherwise, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `t`, `x`, `y`, `n`, and `i` remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The lists `l1` and `l2` also remain the same, with their lengths and contents unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
