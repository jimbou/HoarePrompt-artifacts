Output State: **t is at least 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 for each iteration, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that t remains at least 0, x remains 0, y becomes 0, l1 remains a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 becomes a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 for each iteration, n remains the number of iterations, i remains the number of iterations, cnt remains 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
