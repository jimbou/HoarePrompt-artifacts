Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, the length of l2 is increased by one. Otherwise, if the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, an additional 0 is added at the end of l1. The length of l1 and l2 is now either equal or l2 is one more than its previous value.***
