Output State: **t is greater than 1, x is a non-zero integer equal to its original value divided by 8 and x currently must be greater than 0, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x followed by the three least significant bits of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y**

In this output state, the value of x has been divided by 8 (since it was originally divided by 4 and then divided by 2 again), and the list l1 now contains the binary representation of the original value of x followed by the three least significant bits of the original value of x (since x % 2 was appended to l1). All other variables remain unchanged.
