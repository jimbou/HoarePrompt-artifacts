Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.**

In this output state, the value of y has been halved due to the integer division by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2 has been appended to the list l2. All other variables remain unchanged.
