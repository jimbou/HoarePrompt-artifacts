The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute . Rigtht before the loop, y is an integer, So for the loop to  executed the first time y needed to have been not equal to 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is not equal to 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is an empty list, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
