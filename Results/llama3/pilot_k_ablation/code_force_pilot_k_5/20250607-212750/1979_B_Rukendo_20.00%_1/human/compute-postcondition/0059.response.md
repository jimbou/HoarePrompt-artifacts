Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `i` is `n`, `cnt` is the number of equal elements from the start of `l1` and `l2`**.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains at least 1, stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, `x` and `y` are still 0, and `x != y` is still false. The lists `l1` and `l2` still contain the binary representation of the original `x` and `y` respectively, and `n` is still the length of `l1` which is equal to the length of `l2`. The loop counter `i` has reached the end of the lists, i.e., `i` is equal to `n`. The variable `cnt` has been incremented for each equal element found from the start of `l1` and `l2`, so `cnt` is the number of equal elements from the start of `l1` and `l2`.
