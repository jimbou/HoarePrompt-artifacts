Output State: **t is at least 0, x is 0, y is at least 1 and equal to half of its original value, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing three elements which are the remainder of y divided by 2, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of y has been halved due to the integer division operation y //= 2. The list l2 now contains three elements, which are the remainder of y divided by 2, including the newly appended element. All other variables remain unchanged.
