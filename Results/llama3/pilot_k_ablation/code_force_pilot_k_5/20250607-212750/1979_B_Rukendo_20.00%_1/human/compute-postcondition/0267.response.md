The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time the original y needed to have been greater than 1 and y currently must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is half of its original value and the original y is greater than 1, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the remainder of the original y divided by 2, the remainder of the original y divided by 2, and the remainder of the new y divided by 2.**
