Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y and an extra 0 at the end, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The length of l2 is less than or equal to the length of l1.**

In this output state, the value of l2 has been updated by appending an extra 0 at the end. The length of l2 is now either less than or equal to the length of l1, because we added one element to l2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
