Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is an empty list**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable x becomes 0, and the list l1 contains the binary representation of the original value of x. The other variables, t, stdin, y, and l2, remain unchanged.
