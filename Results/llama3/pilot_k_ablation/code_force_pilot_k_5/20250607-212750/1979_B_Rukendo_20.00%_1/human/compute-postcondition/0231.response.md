Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
