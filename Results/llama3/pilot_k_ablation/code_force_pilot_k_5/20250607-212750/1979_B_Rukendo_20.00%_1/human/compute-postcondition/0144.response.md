The only variable in the loop head is variable y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y.  If y is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than 0 and y is a quarter of its original value. For the loop to be executed one more time y must be greater than 0 and y must be greater than 1.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is greater than 1 and y is a quarter of its original value and y currently must be greater than 0, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1 and the remainder of y divided by 2 which is 1, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one and the original value of y needed to have been greater than 4**
