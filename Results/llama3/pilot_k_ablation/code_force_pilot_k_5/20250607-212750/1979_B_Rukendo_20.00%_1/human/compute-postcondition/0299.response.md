Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is either 4 or 3, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. If `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]`, the current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 4 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that `l1[i]` is equal to `l2[i]` still holds, and if this condition is not met, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
