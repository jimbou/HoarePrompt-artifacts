Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input, and the length of l2 is still less than the length of l1 but now it is one more than its previous value.**

In this output state, the code has appended a 0 to the end of the list l2, increasing its length by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The length of l2 is still less than the length of l1, but it has increased by 1.
