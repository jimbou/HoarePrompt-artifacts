Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is greater than `n+2`, `i` is `n+3`, `cnt` is either 5 or 4, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of 0, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y` plus all the remainders of the original value of `y` divided by 2, 4, 8, 16, and so on, until the original value of `y` is reduced to 0. The current value of `l2` has the same number of elements as the current value of `l1`. Otherwise, the values of `l1` and `l2` remain unchanged. If the element at index `i` of `l1` is equal to the element at index `i` of `l2`, then we don't break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Since the initial value of `cnt` is either 3 or 4, the new value of `cnt` is either 4 or 5. The other variables remain unchanged.
