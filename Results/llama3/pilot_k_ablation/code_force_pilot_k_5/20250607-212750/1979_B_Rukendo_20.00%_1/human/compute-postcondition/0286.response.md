Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `cnt` is 1, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, `l1` is a list containing the binary representation of the first integer from the input, and `l2` is a list containing the binary representation of the second integer from the input. The length of `l1` and `l2` is now either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. The current value of `l1[i]` is equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.**

The code increments the value of `cnt` by 1, so the new value of `cnt` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two. The lists `l1` and `l2` still contain the binary representation of the first and second integers from the input, respectively, and their lengths are still either equal or `l2` is one more than its previous value. The current value of `l1[i]` is still equal to the current value of `l2[i]`.
