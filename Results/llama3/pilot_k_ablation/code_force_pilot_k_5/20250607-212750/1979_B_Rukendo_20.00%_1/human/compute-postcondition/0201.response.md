According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is a non-zero integer equal to half of its original value. This does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to y is not zero. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is greater than 1, x is 0, y is not zero, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of 0, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y plus the remainder of the original value of y divided by 2**
