According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, x is an integer. x being an integer does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to x is not equal to 0.

State: **t is greater than 0, x is not equal to 0, y is an integer, l1 is an empty list, l2 is an empty list, n is the length of the shorter list between l1 and l2, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
