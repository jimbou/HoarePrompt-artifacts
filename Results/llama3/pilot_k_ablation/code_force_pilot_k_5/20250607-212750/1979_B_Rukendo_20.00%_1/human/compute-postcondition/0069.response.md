Output State: **t is at least 0, x is a non-zero integer divided by 8 and the result of the division must be a non-zero integer, y is an integer and equals x multiplied by 8, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2 three times, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 1, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been divided by 2, and the remainder of `x` divided by 2 has been appended to `l1`. The value of `y` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `i`, `cnt`, and `l2`, remain unchanged as well. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed.
