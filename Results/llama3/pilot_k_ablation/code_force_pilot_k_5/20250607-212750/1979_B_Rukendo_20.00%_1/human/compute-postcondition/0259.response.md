Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is greater than 0 and is equal to its original value divided by 4 and the original value of x must have been greater than 0 and even, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing four elements: three identical elements equal to the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of the original x divided by 4, and l2 is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of x has been divided by 2 twice, resulting in a value that is equal to its original value divided by 4. The original value of x must have been greater than 0 and even, as it was previously divided by 2. The list l1 now contains four elements, with the first three elements being identical and equal to the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the fourth element being the remainder of the original x divided by 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
