Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1, i is 1, cnt is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the value of `cnt` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
