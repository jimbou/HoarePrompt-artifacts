According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is not equal to 0 and is an integer. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, x must still be not equal to 0.

State: **t is greater than 0, x is not equal to 0 and is an integer, y is an integer, l1 is a list containing one element which is the remainder of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, n is the length of the shorter list between l1 and l2 which is 1, i is n-1 which is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
