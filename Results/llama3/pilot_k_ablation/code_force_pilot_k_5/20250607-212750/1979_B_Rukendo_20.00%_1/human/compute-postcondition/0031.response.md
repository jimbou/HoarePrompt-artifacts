Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively. If the length of l2 is less than the length of l1, an additional element 0 is appended to l2. Otherwise, if the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, an additional 0 is appended to the end of l1, otherwise no changes are made to l1.***
