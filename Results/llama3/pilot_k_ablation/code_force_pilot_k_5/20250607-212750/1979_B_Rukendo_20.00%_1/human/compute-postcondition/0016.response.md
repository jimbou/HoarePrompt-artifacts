According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable y. If y is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, y is greater than 0 and is the integer part of y divided by 2. This means y is currently an even number. For the loop to execute one more time, y must be greater than 0. So, y must be greater than 0 and must be an odd number. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is greater than 0 and is an odd number, x != y, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original x, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2**
