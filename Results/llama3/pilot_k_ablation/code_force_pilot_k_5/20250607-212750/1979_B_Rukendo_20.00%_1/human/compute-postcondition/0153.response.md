Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, and the length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1. If the length of l1 is less than the length of l2, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x plus one 0. Otherwise, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x.***
