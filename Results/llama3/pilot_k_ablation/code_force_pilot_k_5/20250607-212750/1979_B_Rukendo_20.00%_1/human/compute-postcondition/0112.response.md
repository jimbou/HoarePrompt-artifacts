The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 0, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `l1` is a list containing the remainder of the original `x` divided by 2 for each iteration, `l2` is a list containing the remainder of `y` divided by 2 for each iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 3 and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `l1[i]` equals `l2[i]`, then `cnt` is either 1, 2 or 3. Otherwise, `cnt` is either 0, 1 or 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
