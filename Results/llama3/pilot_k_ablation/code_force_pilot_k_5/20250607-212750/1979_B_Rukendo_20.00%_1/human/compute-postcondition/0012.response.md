Output State: **t is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is greater than 0 and is a quarter of its original value, y is a non-negative integer, x != y, l1 is a list containing five elements: the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, the remainder of the original x divided by 2, and the remainder of x divided by 2 after the code execution, l2 is an empty list**

In this final state, the value of `x` has been halved twice, resulting in it being a quarter of its original value. The list `l1` now contains five elements, with the last element being the remainder of `x` divided by 2 after the code execution. The other elements in `l1` remain unchanged, representing the remainders of the original `x` divided by 2. The state of `t`, `stdin`, `y`, and `l2` remains unchanged.
