The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0, x is greater than 0 and is half of its original value, y is an integer, l1 contains four elements: the original three elements and the remainder of the original value of x divided by 2, l2 is an empty list, n is 1, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**
