Output State: **`t` is at least 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, x is 0, y is 0, x != y is false. l1 and l2 are lists containing the binary representation of the original x and y respectively, and n is the length of l1 which is equal to the length of l2, `n` must be greater than 1. cnt is 1, i is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `y`, `l1`, `l2`, `n`, and `cnt` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` is still 1. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
