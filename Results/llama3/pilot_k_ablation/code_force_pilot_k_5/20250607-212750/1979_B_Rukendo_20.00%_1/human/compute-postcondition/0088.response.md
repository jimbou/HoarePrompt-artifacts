Postcondition: ***t is at least 0, x is 0, y is 0, l1 is a list containing the remainder of the original x divided by 2 for each iteration, l2 is a list containing the remainder of y divided by 2 for each iteration, n is the number of iterations, i is the number of iterations, cnt is 0, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. The length of l2 is larger than or equal to the length of l1***
