Output State: **t is greater than 1, x is an integer, y is an integer, n is greater than or equal to n, i is n-1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, l1 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of x, l2 is a list containing the binary representation of the original value of y.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `y`. The second and third lines initialize `l1` and `l2` as empty lists. The value of `t` is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is not affected by the code. The value of `i` is not affected by the code. The value of `stdin` is affected by the code, it now contains multiple test cases minus one. The value of `l1` is affected by the code, it is now a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `x`. The value of `l2` is affected by the code, it is now a list containing the binary representation of the original value of `y`.
