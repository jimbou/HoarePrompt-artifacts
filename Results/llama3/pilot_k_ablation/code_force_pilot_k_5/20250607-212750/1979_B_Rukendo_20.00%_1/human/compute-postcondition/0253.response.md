Output State: **t is greater than 0, x is divisible by 2 and x is greater than or equal to 0, y is the second integer from the input, cnt is equal to n, i is -1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, l1 is a list containing the remainder of x divided by 2, and l2 is an empty list.**

The code block modifies the values of `x` and `l1`. The first line appends the remainder of `x` divided by 2 to `l1`, which means `l1` now contains two elements: the original remainder of `x` divided by 2, and the new remainder of `x` divided by 2. The second line performs integer division of `x` by 2, effectively dividing `x` by 2 and rounding down to the nearest whole number. This means `x` is now half of its original value, but still divisible by 2. The value of `x` is also greater than or equal to 0, since it was originally greater than 0 and has been divided by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
