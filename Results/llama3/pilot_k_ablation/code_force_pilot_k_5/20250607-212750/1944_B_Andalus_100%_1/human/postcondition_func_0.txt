This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers, separating them into two lists (lft and rgt), and further categorizes them into three lists: ldb (duplicates from lft), rdb (duplicates from rgt), and sng (single occurrences from lft). It then prints a sequence of integers, prioritizing duplicates from ldb and rdb, followed by single occurrences from sng, until a total of 2k integers are printed. This process is repeated for each test case, and the function concludes by printing a new line for every test case.
