Output State: **sz is either 2, 4, 6 or 8, rdb has at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in rdb, and this is printed: the fifth element in rdb which is elem, twice, separated by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it can now be 2, 4, 6, or 8. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged: rdb still has at least 5 elements, elem is still the fifth element in rdb, and the message "the fifth element in rdb which is elem" is still printed twice, separated by a space.
