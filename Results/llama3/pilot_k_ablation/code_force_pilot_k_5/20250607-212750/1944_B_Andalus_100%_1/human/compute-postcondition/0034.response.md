Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `ldb` will contain all the smallest `n-1` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and the list `sng` will contain only the smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. The value of `i` will be `n-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `n-1` times. The other variables remain unchanged.
