To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is empty. sng is empty if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise sng contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1. lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.**
