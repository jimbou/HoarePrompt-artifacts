Output: *sz is either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 2 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the list sng which is elem is printed followed by a space.
