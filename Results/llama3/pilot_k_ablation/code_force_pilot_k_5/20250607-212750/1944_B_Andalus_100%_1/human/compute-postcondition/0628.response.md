To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `ldb`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`, and `ldb` is a list containing at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `ldb` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`sz` is either 0, 2 or 4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing one or more elements, `ldb` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`.**
