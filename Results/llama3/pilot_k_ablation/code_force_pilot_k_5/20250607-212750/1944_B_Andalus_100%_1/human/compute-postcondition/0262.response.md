Output: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 5 elements, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], elem is the fifth element in the list ldb, sz is either 0, 2 or 4, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. Otherwise, lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1]. ldb now contains an additional element which is the current value of lft[i]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng now contains the value of lft[i] appended to it. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then the current value of rgt[i] is equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1] and rdb contains the current value of rgt[i]. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the fifth element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The fifth element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice separated by a space.**
