Output State: **sz is equal to 2 * k + 3, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed, separated by a space.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to 2 * k + 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list rdb still has at least k elements, and all its elements have been printed twice, separated by a space. The list sng still has at least 3 elements, and elem is still the third element in the list. The condition that if sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed, separated by a space, is still valid.
