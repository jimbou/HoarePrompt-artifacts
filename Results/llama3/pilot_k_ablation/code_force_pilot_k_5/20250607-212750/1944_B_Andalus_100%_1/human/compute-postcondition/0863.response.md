The code prints the fourth element of the list `sng`, which is denoted by the variable `elem`. Since the exact elements of the list `sng` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fourth element of the list `sng`.

Output: **the fourth element of the list sng**
