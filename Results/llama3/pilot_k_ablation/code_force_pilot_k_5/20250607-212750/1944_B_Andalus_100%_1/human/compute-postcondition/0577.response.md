Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is empty. sng contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The size of the list sng is updated to be equal to its new length after appending the current element of lft at index i. The other variables remain unchanged. The list sng now contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1.
