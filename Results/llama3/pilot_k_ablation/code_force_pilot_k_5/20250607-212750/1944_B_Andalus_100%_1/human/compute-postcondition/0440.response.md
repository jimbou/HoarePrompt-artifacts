The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ldb.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ldb has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third element in the list.
State: **`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list ldb**
