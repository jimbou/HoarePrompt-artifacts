The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the second element of the list `sng`, followed by a space.

Since `sng` has at least 2 elements and `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, the exact value of `elem` is not provided, but it will be the second element of the list `sng`.

Output: **the second element of the list sng**
