To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 5, `n` must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 5, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains two additional elements which are equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].**
