Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is not defined, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is empty, sng is empty, elem is not defined, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If the first two elements of the sorted list lft are not equal, then sz is equal to 1 plus the length of the list sng, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from the sorted list lft, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is empty. sng is empty if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise sng contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1. lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or two elements, sng is empty or contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1. lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i]. Otherwise, ldb contains one element which is equal to lft[i]. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then sng is empty. Otherwise, sng contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 3, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or two elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i] and sng is empty. Otherwise, ldb contains one element which is equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one, two or three elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains three elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1], the second element is equal to lft[i] and the third element is equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`sz` is equal to the length of the list `sng`, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 5, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is empty, `ldb` is a list containing one, two, three or four elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains four elements: the first element is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the second element is equal to `lft[i]` and the third and fourth elements are equal to `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n-1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the current element of `lft` at index `i`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `sng` contains the current element of `lft` at index `i` and all the elements it had before, and `sz` is equal to the length of the list `sng` plus one.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
