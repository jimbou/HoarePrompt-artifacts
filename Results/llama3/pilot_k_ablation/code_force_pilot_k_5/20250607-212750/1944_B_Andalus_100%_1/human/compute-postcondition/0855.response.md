Output State: **sz is either 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in sng, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The break statement does not change the values of any variables, it only terminates the execution of the loop or if statement it is directly inside.
