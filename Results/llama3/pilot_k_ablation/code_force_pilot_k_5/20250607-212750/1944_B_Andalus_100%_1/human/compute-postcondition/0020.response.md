Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing either two or three integers which are the smallest two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is either 3 or 4.**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated to include the element at index i of the sorted list lft. The other variables remain unchanged. The size of ldb has increased by one, and it now contains either two or three integers, depending on the previous value of ldb. The rest of the variables maintain their original values and properties.
