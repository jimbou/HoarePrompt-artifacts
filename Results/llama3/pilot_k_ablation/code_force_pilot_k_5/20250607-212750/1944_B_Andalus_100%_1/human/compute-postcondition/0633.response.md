Postcondition: ***`sz` is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing one or more elements, `ldb` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then the third element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, followed by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
