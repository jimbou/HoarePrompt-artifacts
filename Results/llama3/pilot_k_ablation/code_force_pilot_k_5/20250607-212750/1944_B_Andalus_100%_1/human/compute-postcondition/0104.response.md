Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing three integers, the smallest, the second smallest and the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus three. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the value of elem is printed, separated by a space.**

The code increments the value of `sz` by 1. The initial value of `sz` was the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus two. After incrementing, the new value of `sz` is the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus three. The other variables remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, otherwise, it prints the value of elem separated by a space.
