Output: *sz is either 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 5 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fifth element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth element of the sng list is printed.
