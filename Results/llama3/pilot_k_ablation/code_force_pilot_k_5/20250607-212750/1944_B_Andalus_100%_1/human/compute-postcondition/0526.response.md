Postcondition: ***`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next next element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is increased by 2 and the next next element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
