The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ldb.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, ldb has at least 2 elements and elem is the second smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and elem is the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 4, the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to -2, the third element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, and `elem` is the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, `sz` is either 0 or 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
