Output State: **`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `ldb` is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`.**

In this output state, the code has appended `lft[i]` to the list `ldb`, which now contains one or more elements equal to `lft[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `sz` still being equal to the length of `sng`, `n` being at least 3, `k` being an integer, `lst` being empty, `T` being greater than 0, `stdin` being empty, `i` being greater than or equal to 4 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` being not defined, `rdb` being an empty list, and `lft` being a sorted list of `n-1` integers. Additionally, `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`.
