You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state before the first execution of the for loop, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State before the for loop: `total` is 10.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 1:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total is 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 1. 
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0**

Example 2:
State before the loop starts: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students.
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer 2:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 1 student the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, total is 0. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 student and the index is 0 and student is the first student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0,  students_list is a list of students that must have at least 1 student, student is the first student in the list, index is 0**


Your Task:
State before the loop starts: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], elem is the last element in the list ldb, sz is equal to 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. Otherwise, lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1]. ldb now contains an additional element which is the current value of lft[i]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng now contains the value of lft[i] appended to it. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then the current value of rgt[i] is equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1] and rdb contains the current value of rgt[i].
```
for elem in sng:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
