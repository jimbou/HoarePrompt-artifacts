Output State: **sz is equal to 2 * k + 1, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, rdb, sng, and elem remain unchanged, as the break statement only exits the current loop or if statement without modifying any variables. The condition that all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, is still valid. The list sng still has at least 2 elements, and elem is still the second element in the list. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
