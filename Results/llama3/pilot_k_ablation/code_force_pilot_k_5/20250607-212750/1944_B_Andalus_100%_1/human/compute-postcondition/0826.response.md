The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, followed by a space. 

`elem` is the fourth element in the list `ldb`. Since `ldb` contains at least 4 elements, `elem` is a valid element in the list.

Output: **the fourth element in the list ldb, the fourth element in the list ldb (followed by a space)**
