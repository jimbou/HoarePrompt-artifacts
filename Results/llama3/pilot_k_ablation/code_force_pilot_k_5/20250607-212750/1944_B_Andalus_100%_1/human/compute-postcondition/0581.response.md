Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of the list `sng`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is empty, `ldb` is a list containing one or two elements where the last element is equal to `lft[i]`, `sng` is empty or contains the current element of `lft` at index `i` if `i` is equal to `n-1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i+1`, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ldb` has been updated to include the current element of `lft` at index `i` as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged.
