Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i], sng is empty, elem is not defined, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. The current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1].**

In this output state, the only change is that ldb is no longer empty, but now contains one element which is equal to lft[i]. All other variables remain unchanged.
