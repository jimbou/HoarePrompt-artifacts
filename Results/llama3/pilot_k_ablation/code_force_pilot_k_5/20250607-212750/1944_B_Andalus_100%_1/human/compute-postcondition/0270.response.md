Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 7 elements, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], elem is the seventh element in the list ldb, sz is either 0, 2, 4, or 6, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two or three. The only change is that the program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
