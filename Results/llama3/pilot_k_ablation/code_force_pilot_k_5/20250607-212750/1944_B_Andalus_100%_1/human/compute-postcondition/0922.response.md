Output State: **sz is either 2 or a multiple of 2 plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the list sng which is elem is printed followed by a space**

The value of sz is incremented by 1. Since sz was either 1 or a multiple of 2, it is now either 2 or a multiple of 2 plus 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
