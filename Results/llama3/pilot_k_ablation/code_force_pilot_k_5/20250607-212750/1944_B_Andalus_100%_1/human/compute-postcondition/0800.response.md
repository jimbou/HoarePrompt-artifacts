To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is greater than 4.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 5. For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 5.

State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 5, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i]. sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], and sng has an additional element which is lft[i] if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and elem is the second last element in sng. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.**
