Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, i is n - 1, rdb is an empty list, elem is None, sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed**

The code block reads two integers from the input, assigns them to `n` and `k`, and then reads a list of `2n` integers, splitting it into two lists `lft` and `rgt`. It then sorts both lists. The variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are initialized as empty lists. The variable `i` is set to `n - 1`. The variable `sz` is either `2 * k` or the largest even number less than `2 * k`. The code also prints all the integers from the list `ldb` twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed.
