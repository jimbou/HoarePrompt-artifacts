Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 1, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2 * k + 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Since sz is now greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
