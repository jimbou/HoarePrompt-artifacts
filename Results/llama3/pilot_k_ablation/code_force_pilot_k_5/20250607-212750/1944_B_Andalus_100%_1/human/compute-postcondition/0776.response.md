To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n` and greater than or equal to 3.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` will be greater than or equal to 4.

The state of `n` remains the same, which is an integer and must be at least 3.

The other variables in the state, such as `sz`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `rgt`, `rdb`, `lft`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `elem`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, and `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`.**
