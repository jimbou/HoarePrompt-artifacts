Output State: **sz is either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 2 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second element in sng, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on the variables are still valid.
