The `print(elem, elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

Since `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`, the output will be the second element of `ldb` printed twice.

Output: **[the second element of the list ldb] [the second element of the list ldb]**
