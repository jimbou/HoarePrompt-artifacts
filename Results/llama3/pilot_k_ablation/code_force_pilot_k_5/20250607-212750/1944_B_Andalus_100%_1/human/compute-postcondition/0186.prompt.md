Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the last element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and the last element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the first integer in the list `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first integer of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the second integer in the list `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 3 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the third integer in the list `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 4 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fourth integer in the list `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 5 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fifth integer in the list `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth integer in the list `sng` is printed, which is `elem`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
