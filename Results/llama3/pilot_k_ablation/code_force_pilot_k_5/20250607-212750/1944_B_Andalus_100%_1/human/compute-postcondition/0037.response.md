Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to `rgt[i]` and also equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `rdb` has been updated to include the current value of `rgt[i]`, which is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
