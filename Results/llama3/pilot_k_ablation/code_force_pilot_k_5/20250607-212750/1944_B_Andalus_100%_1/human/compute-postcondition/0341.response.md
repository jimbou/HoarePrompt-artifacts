The only variables in the loop head are variable  elem and list  sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, sz is equal to 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, and all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **sz is equal to 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list**
