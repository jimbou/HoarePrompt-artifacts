The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sng.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has 4 elements, elem is the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing three integers, the smallest, the second smallest, and the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, and `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus four, and the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is `elem`, is printed, separated by a space.**
