Postcondition: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` also contains the integer at index `i` of `lft`, otherwise no change is made. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is either 5 or 6.**
