Output State: **sz is either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 2 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second element in the sng list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin is still empty.
