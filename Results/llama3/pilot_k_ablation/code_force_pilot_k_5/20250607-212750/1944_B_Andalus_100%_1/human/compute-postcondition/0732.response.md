To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the list `sng`. The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which takes on the value of each element in `sng` during each iteration.

According to the state at the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in `sng`. For the loop to execute again, `elem` should take on the value of the next element in `sng`.

Since `sng` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element, the next element in `sng` would be the third element.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **sz is either 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 3 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the third element in sng**

Note that only the state of `elem` and `sng` has changed, as they are the only variables in the loop head. The other variables remain unchanged.
