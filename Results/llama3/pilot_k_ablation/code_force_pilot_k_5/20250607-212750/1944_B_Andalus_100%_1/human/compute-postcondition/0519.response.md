Output State: **`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The variables `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `elem` retain their initial values and properties, with `rdb` still having at least one more element and `elem` being the next element in `rdb`.
