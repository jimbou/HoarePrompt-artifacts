Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or two elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i] and sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, ldb contains one element which is equal to lft[i] and sng contains the current element of lft at index i.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list sng is updated to be equal to sz. The value of n, k, T, i, and the emptiness of lst, stdin, rgt[i], and rdb remain unchanged. The list ldb still contains one or two elements, depending on whether lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1]. The list lft and rgt remain sorted lists of n and k integers, respectively. The list sng now contains the current element of lft at index i.
