To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sng` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. 

State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 2 * len(ldb), n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in sng**
