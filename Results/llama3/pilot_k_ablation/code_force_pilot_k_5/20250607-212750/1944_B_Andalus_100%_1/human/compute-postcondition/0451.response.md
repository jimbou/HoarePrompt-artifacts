Postcondition: ***`sz` is increased by 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the fourth element in the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
