Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is 0, n is greater than or equal to n, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to n. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list that contains the value of rgt[i - 1].
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `elem` are as initially described. If `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is set to 2 and the first element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. If `2 * k - sz` is less than 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list ldb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the second element in the list ldb which is elem is printed twice. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list ldb. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the third element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`sz` is increased by 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the fourth element in the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`sz` is increased by at least 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 5 elements, `elem` is the fifth element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is increased by 4 and the fifth element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
