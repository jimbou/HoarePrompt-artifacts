The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the rdb.  If the list has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the elem is the fifth element in the list.
State: **sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the fifth element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 5 elements. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2 and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
