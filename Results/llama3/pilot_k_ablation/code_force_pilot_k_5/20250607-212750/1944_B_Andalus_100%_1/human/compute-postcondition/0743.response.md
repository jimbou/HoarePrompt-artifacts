Output: *sz is either 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 4 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fourth element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken., and the fourth element of the list sng which is elem is being printed followed by a space*
