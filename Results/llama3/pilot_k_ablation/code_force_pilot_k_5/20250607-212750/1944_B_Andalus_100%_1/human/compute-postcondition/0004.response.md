Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, the first two elements of `lft` are not equal, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `sng` has been updated to contain the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the first element of the sorted list `lft`. The other variables remain unchanged.
