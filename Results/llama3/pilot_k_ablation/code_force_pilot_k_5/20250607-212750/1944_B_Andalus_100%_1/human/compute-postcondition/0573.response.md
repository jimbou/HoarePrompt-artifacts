Postcondition: ***sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is empty, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. The first two elements of the sorted list lft are equal. If i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1, then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, no change is made to sng.***
