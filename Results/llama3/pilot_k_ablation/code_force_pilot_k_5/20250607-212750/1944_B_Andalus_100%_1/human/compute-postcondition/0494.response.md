Output State: **sz is 0, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb, ldb is empty, sng is a list that must have at least min(len(sng), 2 * k - 2 * len(ldb)) elements, elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed, and nothing is printed**

In this output state, the value of sz has been reset to 0, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list sng still has at least min(len(sng), 2 * k - 2 * len(ldb)) elements, and elem is still the last element in the list sng that was printed. No output has been printed.
