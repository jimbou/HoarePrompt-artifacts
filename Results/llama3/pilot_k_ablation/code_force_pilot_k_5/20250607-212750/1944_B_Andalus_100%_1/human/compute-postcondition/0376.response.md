Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of integers, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input.**

The code block reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`. It then reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `lst`. The list is then split into two parts, `lft` and `rgt`, based on the value of `n`. Both `lft` and `rgt` are sorted in ascending order. The variables `ldb`, `rdb`, and `sng` are initialized as empty lists. The variable `sz` is not modified by the code, so its value remains equal to the length of `sng` plus 2 times `k`. The variable `T` is not modified by the code, so its value remains greater than 1. The input is fully consumed by the code, so there is no input left in `stdin`.
