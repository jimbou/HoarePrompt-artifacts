Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 5, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements and an additional element which is equal to rgt[i], ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains two additional elements which are equal to rgt[i] and one more element which is equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list sng is still equal to sz, n is still greater than 5, k is still an integer, lst is still empty, T is still greater than 1, and stdin is still empty. The value of i is still 5, and rgt[i] is still defined. The list rdb now contains one or more elements and an additional element which is equal to rgt[i]. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains two additional elements which are equal to rgt[i] and one more element which is equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i]. The list ldb still contains one or more elements, sng still contains one or more elements, and lft is still a sorted list of n integers.
