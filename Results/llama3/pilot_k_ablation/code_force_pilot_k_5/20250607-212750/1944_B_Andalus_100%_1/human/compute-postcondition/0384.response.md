Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `sng` has one more element which is `lft[i]`, and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of `sng` has increased by 1 with the addition of `lft[i]` as its new element. All other variables remain unchanged, and their previous conditions still hold true.
