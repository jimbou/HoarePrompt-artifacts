Output State: **sz is 0, the loop terminates when sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, all elements in sng have been printed, and a blank line is printed**.

In this output state, the value of sz has been reset to 0. The other conditions from the initial state are still valid, including the termination condition of the loop, the fact that all elements in sng have been printed, and the printing of a blank line.
