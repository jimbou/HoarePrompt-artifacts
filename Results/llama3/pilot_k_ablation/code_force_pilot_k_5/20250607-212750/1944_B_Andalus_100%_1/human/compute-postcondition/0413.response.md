Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 2, rdb is a list with an additional element rgt[2]**.

In this output state, the values of sz, n, k, lst, T, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of i is still 2. The list rdb has been updated by appending the element rgt[2] to it.
