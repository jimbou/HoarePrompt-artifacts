According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sng`. If the list `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, which ensures that the loop will execute. So, we can adjust the state of `sng` to have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`.

State: **sz is either 0 or a multiple of 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop**
