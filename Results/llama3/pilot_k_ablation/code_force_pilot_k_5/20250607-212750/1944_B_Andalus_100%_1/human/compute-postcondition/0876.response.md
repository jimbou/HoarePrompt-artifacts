According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `rdb`. If `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `rdb` is not mentioned in the state, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least 1 element. Additionally, `elem` is mentioned in the loop head, so its state needs to be adjusted to be the first element in `rdb`.

State: **sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the first element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 1 element**
