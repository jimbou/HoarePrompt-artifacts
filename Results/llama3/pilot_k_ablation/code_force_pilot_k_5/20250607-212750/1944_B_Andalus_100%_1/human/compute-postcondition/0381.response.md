Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1, `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `ldb` is a list with an additional element equal to `lft[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The size `sz` is still equal to the length of `sng` plus twice the integer `k`. The value of `n` is still at least 2. The integer `k` remains unchanged. The list `lst` still contains integers. The value of `T` is still greater than 1. There is still no input in `stdin`. The value of `i` is still 1. The value of `lft[i]` is still equal to the value of `lft[i - 1]`. The list `ldb` has been updated to include an additional element, which is equal to the value of `lft[i]`.
