To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `elem` and the list `sng`. The loop will execute if `sng` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to have at least one element, and `elem` will be the first element in `sng`.

State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 1 element, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in sng**
