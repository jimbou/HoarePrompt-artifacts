Output State: **sz is 0, n is greater than or equal to n, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to n. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list that contains the value of rgt[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of sz has been changed to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between the variables, such as n being greater than or equal to n, k being an integer, and T being greater than 1, are still valid. The list lst and the conditional relationship between rgt[i], rgt[i - 1], and rdb also remain unchanged.
