According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop will not execute. So, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. Since the loop starts from 1, `i` should be 1.

State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 1**
