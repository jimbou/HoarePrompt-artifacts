Output State: **sz is either 2 or 4, rdb has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in rdb, and "elem elem " is printed.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it can be either 2 or 4. The values of rdb and elem remain the same, as they are not affected by the code. The print statement is still present, printing "elem elem " without a newline.
