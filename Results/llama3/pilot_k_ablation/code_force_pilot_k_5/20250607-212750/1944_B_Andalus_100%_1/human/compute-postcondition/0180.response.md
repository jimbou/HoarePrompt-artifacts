To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `sng` is a list containing the smallest `min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1))` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and it must have at least 4 integers.

Since `elem` is the fourth integer in the list `sng`, we can infer that the list `sng` has at least 4 elements. For the loop to execute again, the list `sng` must have at least 5 elements.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 5 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fifth integer in the list `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1.**
