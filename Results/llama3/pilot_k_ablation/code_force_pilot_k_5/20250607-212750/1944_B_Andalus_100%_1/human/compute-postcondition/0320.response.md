Output State: **sz is either 0 or 2, rdb has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in rdb, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, rdb, and elem remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement.
