Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains one element which is equal to rgt[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains one element which is equal to rgt[i - 1]. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 3, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains two additional elements which are equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 5, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements and an additional element which is equal to rgt[i], ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains two additional elements which are equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
