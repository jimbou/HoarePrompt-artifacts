The only variable in the loop head is variable elem and sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable sng. If sng is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, sng is either an empty list or a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to sng is not empty and elem is the first element in the list sng.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, sng is not empty, elem is the first element in the list sng, rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], lft[i] is appended to ldb if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], and lft[i] is appended to sng if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and sz is equal to 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more.**
