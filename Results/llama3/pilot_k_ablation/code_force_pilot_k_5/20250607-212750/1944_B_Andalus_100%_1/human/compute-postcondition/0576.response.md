Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is not equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], sng is empty if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise sng contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1. lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list sng is still equal to sz. The values of n, k, T, and i remain unchanged. The list lst is still empty, and the stdin is still empty. The value of rgt[i] is still undefined, and the list rdb is still empty. The list ldb now contains two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is not equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. The list sng is empty if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise it contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1. The lists lft and rgt remain unchanged.
