Output State: **sz is either 3 or a multiple of 2 plus 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 3 or a multiple of 2 plus 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the loop and the printing of elem are still valid.
