Output State: **`sz` is either 0, 2 or 4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the values of the variables. The only effect of the code is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
