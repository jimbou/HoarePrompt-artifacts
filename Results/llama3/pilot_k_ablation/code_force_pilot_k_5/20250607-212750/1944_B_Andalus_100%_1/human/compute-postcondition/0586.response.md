Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or two elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains three elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1], the second element is equal to lft[i] and the third element is equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list sng is still equal to sz. The values of n, k, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb, and lft remain the same. The list ldb now contains one or three elements. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains three elements: the first two elements are the same as before, and the third element is equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.
