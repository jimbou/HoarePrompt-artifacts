Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 2, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the list sng which is elem is printed**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2 * k + 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid, and the second element of the list sng, which is elem, is still printed.
