Output State: sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, elem is the last element in ldb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 0 and all elements in ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In natural language, after the loop executes all iterations, the value of sz will be a multiple of 2 up to 2 * k, indicating that all elements in ldb have been processed and printed twice. The list ldb will be empty, and the variable elem will hold the last element that was processed. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged.
