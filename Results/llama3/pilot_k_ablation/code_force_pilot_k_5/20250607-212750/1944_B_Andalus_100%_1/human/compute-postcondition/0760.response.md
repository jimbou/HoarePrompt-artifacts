Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is less than n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1], sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz, the list lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, and elem is the second last element in sng.**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated to include the value of lft[i], which is also equal to lft[i - 1]. All other variables remain unchanged.
