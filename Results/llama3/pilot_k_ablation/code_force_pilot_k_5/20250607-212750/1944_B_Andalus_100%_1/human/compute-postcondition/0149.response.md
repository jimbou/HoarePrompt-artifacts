The code prints the fifth element in the list `rdb` twice, separated by a space. The fifth element in the list `rdb` is an integer from the sorted list `rgt` that is equal to the integer before it. Since the exact value of the fifth element in the list `rdb` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fifth element in the list `rdb` twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the fifth element in the list rdb)**
