Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the last element in sng**

The code snippet has no effect on the state of the variables sz, T, i, rgt[i], rdb, ldb, sng, and elem. The values of n and k are updated to the integer values from the input. The list lst is assigned the values from the input, and then it is split into two lists, lft and rgt, which are sorted. The lists ldb and rdb are assigned empty lists.
