Postcondition: ***sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains one element which is equal to rgt[i - 1]. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].***
