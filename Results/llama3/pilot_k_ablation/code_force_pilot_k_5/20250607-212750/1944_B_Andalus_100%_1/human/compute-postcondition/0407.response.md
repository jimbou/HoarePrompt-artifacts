Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to n, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to n. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list that contains the value of lft[i]. Otherwise, if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element lft[i] appended to it.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations from 1 to n. The value of 'i' is now equal to 'n', indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The conditions for appending elements to 'ldb' and 'sng' remain the same as in the previous output states. The state of other variables 'sz', 'k', 'lst', 'T', and 'stdin' remains unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
