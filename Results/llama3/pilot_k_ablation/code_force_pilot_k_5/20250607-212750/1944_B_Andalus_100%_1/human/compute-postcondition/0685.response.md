To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb` list. If `rdb` has at least 1 element, the loop will execute.

State: **sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing at least 1 element, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in rdb, and nothing is printed**
