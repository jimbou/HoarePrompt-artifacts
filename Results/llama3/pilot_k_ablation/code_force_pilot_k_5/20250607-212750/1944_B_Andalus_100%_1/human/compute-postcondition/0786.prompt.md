Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, and elem is the second last element in sng. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is less than n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. Otherwise, ldb is an empty list. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft, and elem is the second last element in sng. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 3, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is less than n and greater than or equal to 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft, and elem is the second last element in sng. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i], otherwise no changes are made to sng and elem.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is less than `n` and greater than or equal to 3, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, and `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to 5 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` now contains an additional element which is `lft[i]`. Otherwise, `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
