Output State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, rdb has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in rdb, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, rdb, and elem remain unchanged. The only effect of the code is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The precondition that rdb has at least 4 elements and elem is the fourth element in rdb is still valid after the code has been executed.
