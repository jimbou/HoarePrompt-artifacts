Output State: **sz is either 0, 2 or 4, rdb has at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in rdb, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, rdb, and elem remain unchanged. The code only executes a break statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside. The preconditions that sz is either 0, 2, or 4, rdb has at least 3 elements, and elem is the third element in rdb are still valid after the code has been executed.
