Output: *sz is either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 2 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the sng list which is elem is being printed.
