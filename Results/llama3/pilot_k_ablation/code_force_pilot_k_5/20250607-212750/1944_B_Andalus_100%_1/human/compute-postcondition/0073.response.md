To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `ldb`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ldb` is a list containing `n - 1` integers, which are the smallest `n - 1` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and has at least 3 elements. The third element of `ldb`, which is `elem`, is printed twice with a space in between, and `elem` is the third smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ldb` must have at least one more element. Since `ldb` contains the smallest `n - 1` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, the next element in `ldb` would be the next smallest integer between 1 and `n` inclusive.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.**
