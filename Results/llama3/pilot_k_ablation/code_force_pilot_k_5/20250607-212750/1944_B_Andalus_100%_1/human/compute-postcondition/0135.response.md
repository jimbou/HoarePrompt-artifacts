Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least two integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the second element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 4 and the second element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, sz is 2 and the second element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space.**
