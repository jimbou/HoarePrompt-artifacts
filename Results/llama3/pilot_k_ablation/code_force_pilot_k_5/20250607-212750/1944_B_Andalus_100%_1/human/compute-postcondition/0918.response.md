Output State: **sz is either 1 or a multiple of 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
