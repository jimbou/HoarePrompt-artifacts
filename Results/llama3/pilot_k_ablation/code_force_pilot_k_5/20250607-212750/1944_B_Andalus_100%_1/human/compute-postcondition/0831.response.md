To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. In this case, the only object in the loop head is `elem` and `ldb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb` list. If the list has at least 5 elements, the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the `elem` is the fifth element in the list.

State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in ldb**
