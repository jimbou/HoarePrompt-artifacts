Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 4, rdb is a list with rgt[4] appended to it.**

In this output state, the value of sz remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The value of n is still greater than 4, and k is still an integer. The list lst also remains unchanged. The value of T is still greater than 1. The stdin still contains no input. The value of i is still 4. The list rdb has been updated by appending the value of rgt[4] to it.
