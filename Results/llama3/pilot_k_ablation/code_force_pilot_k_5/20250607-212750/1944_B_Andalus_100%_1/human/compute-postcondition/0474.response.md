Postcondition: ***`sz` is increased by 1, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
