Output State: **sz is either 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 2 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the sng list is printed.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it can now take on values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the value of sz being greater than or equal to 2 * k.
