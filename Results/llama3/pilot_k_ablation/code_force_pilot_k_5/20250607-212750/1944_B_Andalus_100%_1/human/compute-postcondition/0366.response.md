The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list  sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng.  If the list has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the elem is the fifth element in the list.
State: **`sz` is equal to 2 * k + 4, `rdb` has at least k elements, all elements in `rdb` have been printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list that must have at least 5 elements, `elem` is the fifth element in the list**
