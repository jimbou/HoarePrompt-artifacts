Output State: **`sz` is increased by 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, and this is printed: the next element in `rdb` which is `elem` twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end**

In natural language, the output state is: the size `sz` has been increased by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, and `rgt[i]` are still the same. The lists `rdb` and `ldb` are also unchanged, with `rdb` still having at least one more element. The variable `sng` remains the same. The next element in `rdb`, which is `elem`, is still printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.
