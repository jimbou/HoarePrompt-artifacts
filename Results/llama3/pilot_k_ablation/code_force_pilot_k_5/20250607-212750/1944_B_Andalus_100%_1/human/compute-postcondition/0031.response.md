Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive and the integer at index 5 or 6 of `lft`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is either 5 or 6.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state except that the list `sng` now contains an additional element which is the integer at index 5 or 6 of the sorted list `lft`.
