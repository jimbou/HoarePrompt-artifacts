Output State: **`sz` is increased by 2 * len(ldb) + 1, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. If the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. The first element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, in addition to the initial increase by 2 times the length of `ldb`. The other variables remain unchanged. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, otherwise, no changes are made. The first element of the list `sng`, which is `elem`, has been printed followed by a space.
