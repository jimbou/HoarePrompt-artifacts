Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, if the first two elements of lft are not equal, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, sng remains an empty list. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, if the first two elements of lft are not equal, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, sng is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive if the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, otherwise sng remains a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1 if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], otherwise i is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing either one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is either 3 or 4. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either two or three integers which are the smallest two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either one or two integers which are the smallest one or two integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either two or three integers which are the smallest two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is not equal to n - 1 and lft[i] is equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either one or two integers which are the smallest one or two integers between 1 and n inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is either 4 or 5. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either two, three or four integers which are the smallest two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either two, three or four integers which are the smallest two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is not equal to n - 1 and lft[i] is equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing either one, two, three, four or five integers which are the smallest one, two, three, four or five integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains one more integer. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` also contains the integer at index `i` of `lft`, otherwise no change is made. `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is either 5 or 6.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
