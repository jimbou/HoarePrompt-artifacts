To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `rdb` is a list containing at least one integer from the sorted list `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them. We also know that `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `elem` and `rdb`. Since `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, we need to move to the next element in `rdb` for the loop to execute again.

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least two integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the second element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 2 and the second element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
