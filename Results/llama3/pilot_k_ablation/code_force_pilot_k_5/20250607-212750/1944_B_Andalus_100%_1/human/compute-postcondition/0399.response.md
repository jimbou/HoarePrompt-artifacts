Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 4, `sng` has one more element which is `lft[4]`.**

The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `i` is 4, the value appended is `lft[4]`. The length of `sng` increases by 1. The other variables are not affected by this code.
