Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is 2, `elem` is the first element of `ldb`, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been updated to 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
