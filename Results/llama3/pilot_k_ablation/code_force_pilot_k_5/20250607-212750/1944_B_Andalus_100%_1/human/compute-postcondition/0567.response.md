To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1, and `i` should be initialized to 1 since the loop starts from 1.

State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is empty, sng is empty, elem is not defined, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If the first two elements of the sorted list lft are not equal, then sz is equal to 1 plus the length of the list sng, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from the sorted list lft, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
