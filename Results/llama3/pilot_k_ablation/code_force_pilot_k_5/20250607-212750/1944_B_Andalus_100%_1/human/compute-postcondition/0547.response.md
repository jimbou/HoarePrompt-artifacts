Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 3, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, resulting in sz being equal to 2 * k + 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid, and if sz is indeed greater than or equal to 2 * k, the third element of the list sng (elem) is printed followed by a space.
