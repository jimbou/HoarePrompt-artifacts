Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 5, `ldb` is a list that contains the value of `lft[i]`**

In this output state, the value of `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin` and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The only change is that the list `ldb` now contains the value of `lft[i]`, where `i` is 5.
