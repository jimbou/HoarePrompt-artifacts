Output: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the first element of the list `sng` separated by a space if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, or continues execution if `sz` is less than `2 * k`. In either case, all variables remain unchanged, including `T` as a positive integer greater than 1, `_` as 1, `n` as an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` as an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` as a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` as a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` as a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` as not empty and having at least 5 elements, `elem` as the fifth element in the list `sng`, `rdb` as either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, and `lft[i]` as appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` as appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. Additionally, `sz` is now equal to 2 * k + 4, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space.**
