Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is 0, `elem` is the first element of `ldb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently in. Since there are no assignments or modifications to any variables, all the variables retain their original values. The only change is that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement, which is reflected in the output state.
