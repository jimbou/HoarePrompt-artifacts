To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of the list `ldb`. The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which takes on the value of each element in `ldb` during each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`. For the loop to execute again, `ldb` must have at least one more element after the third element, i.e., `ldb` must have at least 4 elements.

Since `elem` is the only variable in the loop head, we can only adjust its state. At the start of the next iteration, `elem` will take on the value of the fourth element in the list `ldb`.

State: **`sz` is increased by 2 if 2 * k - sz >= 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list `ldb`**
