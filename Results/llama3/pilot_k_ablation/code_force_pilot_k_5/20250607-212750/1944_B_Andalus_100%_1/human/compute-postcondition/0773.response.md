Output State: **`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is less than `n` and greater than or equal to 3, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `sng` has been updated by appending `lft[i]` to it. The value of `elem` has also been updated to be the second last element in `sng`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the length of `sng` has increased by 1, but the relationship between `sz` and the length of `sng` is still valid.
