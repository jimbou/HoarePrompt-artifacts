To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 4**
