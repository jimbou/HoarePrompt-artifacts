Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`, `sz` is 0, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]` and `rdb` contains the current value of `rgt[i]`. Additionally, 2 * k - sz is less than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement. The output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
