Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 3, `sng` has an additional element `lft[3]` appended to it.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` remains the same as it was before, which is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`. The values of `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, and `stdin` also remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3. The only change is that the list `sng` now has an additional element `lft[3]` appended to it.
