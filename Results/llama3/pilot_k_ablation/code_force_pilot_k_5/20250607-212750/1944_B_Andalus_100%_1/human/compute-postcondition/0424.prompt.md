Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to n, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to n. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list that contains the value of lft[i]. Otherwise, if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element lft[i] appended to it.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing the value of rgt[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 2, and if rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list with an additional element rgt[2].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to 3, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 3. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list with an additional element rgt[3].

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 4. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list with rgt[4] appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 5, rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], rdb is a list with rgt[5] appended to it. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], rgt[5] is appended to rdb one more time.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
