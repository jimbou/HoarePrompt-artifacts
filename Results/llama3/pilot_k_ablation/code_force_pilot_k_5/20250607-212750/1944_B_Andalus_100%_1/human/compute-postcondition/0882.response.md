Output State: **sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the first element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 1 element, and 2 * k - sz is less than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
