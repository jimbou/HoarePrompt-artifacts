Postcondition: ***sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing at least 1 element, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in rdb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the first element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, nothing is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
