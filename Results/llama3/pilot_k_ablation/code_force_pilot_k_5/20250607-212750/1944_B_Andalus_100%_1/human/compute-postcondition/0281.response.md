Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `lft[i]` is appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` is appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sz` is equal to 2 * k + 1, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, separated by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, separated by a space.
