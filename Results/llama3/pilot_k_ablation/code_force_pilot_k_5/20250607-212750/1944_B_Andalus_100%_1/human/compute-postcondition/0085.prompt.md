Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, sz is 0.
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is either 0 or 2, `elem` is the first element of `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 2 and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 4, the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to -2, the second element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, and `elem` is the second smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, `sz` is either 0 or 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 4, the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to -2, the third element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, and `elem` is the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, `sz` is either 0 or 2, and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is increased by 2 and the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 4 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fifth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the fifth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive which is `elem` is printed twice, and `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
