Postcondition: ***sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains two additional elements which are equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].***
