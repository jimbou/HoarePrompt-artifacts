Output State: **sz is equal to 2 * k + 2, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the list sng which is elem has been printed followed by a space.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to 2 * k + 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list rdb still has at least k elements, and all its elements have been printed twice, separated by a space. The list sng still has at least 2 elements, and elem is still the second element in the list. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid, and the second element of the list sng (elem) has been printed followed by a space.
