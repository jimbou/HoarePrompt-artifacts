Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is 0, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb, ldb is empty, sng is a list that must have at least min(len(sng), 2 * k - 2 * len(ldb)) elements, elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng`, `elem` are as described in the precondition. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is 2 and the first element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, i.e., `elem elem`. Otherwise, nothing is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged. If 2 * `k` - `sz` >= 2, then the next element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character and `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the next element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the next element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next next element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is increased by 2 and the next next element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
