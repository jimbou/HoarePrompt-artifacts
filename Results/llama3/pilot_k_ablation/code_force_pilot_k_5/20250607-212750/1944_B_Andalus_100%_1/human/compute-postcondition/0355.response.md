Output State: **sz is equal to 2 * k + 2, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: the size sz is still equal to 2 times k plus 2, the list rdb still has at least k elements and all its elements have been printed twice separated by a space, the list sng still has at least 3 elements, the variable elem is still the third element in the list sng, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
