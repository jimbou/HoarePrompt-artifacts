Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 1, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list sng and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code snippet `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that it is directly inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of a loop or if statement.
