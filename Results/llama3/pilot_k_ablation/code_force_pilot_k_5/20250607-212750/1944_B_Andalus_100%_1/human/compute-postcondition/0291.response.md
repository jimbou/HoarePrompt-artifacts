Output State: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the first element of the list `sng` separated by a space if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, or continues execution if `sz` is less than `2 * k`. In either case, `T` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `_` remains 1, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` remains an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` remains a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` remains a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` remains not empty and has at least 3 elements, `elem` remains the third element in the list `sng`, `rdb` remains either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `lft[i]` remains appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` remains appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sz` is now equal to 2 * k + 3, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with `sz` incremented by 1, making it equal to 2 * k + 3. The program still either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the first element of the list `sng` separated by a space if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, or continues execution if `sz` is less than `2 * k`. All other variables and conditions remain the same.
