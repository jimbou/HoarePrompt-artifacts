Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 4, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in the list sng and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
