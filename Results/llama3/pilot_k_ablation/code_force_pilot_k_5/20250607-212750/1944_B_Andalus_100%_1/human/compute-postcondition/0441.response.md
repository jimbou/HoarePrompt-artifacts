Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.

`elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`, which has at least 3 elements.

Output: **[value of elem] [value of elem] (where elem is the third element in the list ldb)**
