Output: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 1 integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the first integer in the list `sng`, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first integer of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, separated by a space.**
