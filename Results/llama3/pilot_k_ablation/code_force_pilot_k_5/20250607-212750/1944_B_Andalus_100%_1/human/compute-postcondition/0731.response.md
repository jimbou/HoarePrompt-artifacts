Output State: **sz is either 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 2 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the list sng which is elem is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: sz has been incremented by 1, and its possible values are now odd integers starting from 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the loop or if statement is still dependent on the value of sz being greater than or equal to 2 times k.
