The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].**
