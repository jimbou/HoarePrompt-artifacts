Output: **sz is either 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 4 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fourth element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fourth element of the sng list which is elem is printed**
