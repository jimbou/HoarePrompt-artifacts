Postcondition: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 3, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is less than n and greater than or equal to 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft, and elem is the second last element in sng. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i], otherwise no changes are made to sng and elem.**
