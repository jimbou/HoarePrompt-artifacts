Postcondition: ***sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is not defined, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is empty, sng is empty, elem is not defined, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If the first two elements of the sorted list lft are not equal, then sz is equal to 1 plus the length of the list sng, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from the sorted list lft, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
