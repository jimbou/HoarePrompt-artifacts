The code prints the fourth element of the list `sng`, which is denoted by the variable `elem`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't determine its exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fourth element of the list `sng`.

Output: **elem (where elem is the fourth element in the list sng)**
