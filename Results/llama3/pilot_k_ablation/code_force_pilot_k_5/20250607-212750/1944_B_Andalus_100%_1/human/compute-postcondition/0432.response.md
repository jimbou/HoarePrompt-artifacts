Output State: **`sz` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list that contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list, (2 * k - sz < 2), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and conditions, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
