Output State: **sz is either 2, 4, 6 or 8, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in ldb, and this is printed: the fourth element in ldb twice, separated by a space.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it can now be 2, 4, 6, or 8. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin is still empty, and the printed output remains the same.
