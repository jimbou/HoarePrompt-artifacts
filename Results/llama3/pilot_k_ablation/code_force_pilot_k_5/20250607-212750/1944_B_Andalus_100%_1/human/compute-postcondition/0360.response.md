To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`, which means `sng` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 4 elements, and `elem` must be the fourth element in the list.

The other variables `sz`, `rdb`, and `k` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`sz` is equal to 2 * k + 3, `rdb` has at least k elements, all elements in `rdb` have been printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list.**
