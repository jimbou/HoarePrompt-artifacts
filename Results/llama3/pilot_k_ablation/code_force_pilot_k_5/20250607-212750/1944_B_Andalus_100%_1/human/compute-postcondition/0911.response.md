Output State: **sz is either 0 or a multiple of 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement does not change the values of any variables, but it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it is directly inside. Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the additional note that we have broken out of the innermost loop or if statement.
