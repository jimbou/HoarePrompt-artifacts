Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers. rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i]. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains two additional elements which are equal to rgt[i].**

In this output state, the value of rdb has been updated to include an additional element equal to rgt[i]. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1] still holds, and if true, rdb now contains two additional elements equal to rgt[i].
