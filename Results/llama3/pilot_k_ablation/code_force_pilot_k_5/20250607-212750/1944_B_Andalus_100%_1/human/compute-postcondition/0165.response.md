The code prints the second integer in the list `sng`, which is `elem`, separated by a space.
Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second integer in the list `sng`.
Output: **elem (where elem is the second integer in the list sng)**
