Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 2, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list sng and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. However, it causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the program has broken out of the innermost loop or conditional statement.
