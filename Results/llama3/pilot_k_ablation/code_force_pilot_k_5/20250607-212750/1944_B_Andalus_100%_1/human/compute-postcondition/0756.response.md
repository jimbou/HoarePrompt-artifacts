Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz and has an additional element which is the first element of lft, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second last element in sng.**

In this output state, the value of sz remains the same, which is either equal to the length of sng. The values of n, k, T, i, and the emptiness of lst, rdb, and ldb also remain unchanged. The list sng has been modified by appending the first element of lft, which means it now has at least as many elements as sz and has an additional element. The list lft has been modified by removing its first element, so it now contains n-1 integers. The list rgt remains unchanged. The value of elem has also been updated to be the second last element in sng.
