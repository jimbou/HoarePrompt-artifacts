The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 3 or 4, `n` is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is either 4 or 5.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing either one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is either 4 or 5. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either two or three integers which are the smallest two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either one or two integers which are the smallest one or two integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either two or three integers which are the smallest two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is not equal to n - 1 and lft[i] is equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either one or two integers which are the smallest one or two integers between 1 and n inclusive.**
