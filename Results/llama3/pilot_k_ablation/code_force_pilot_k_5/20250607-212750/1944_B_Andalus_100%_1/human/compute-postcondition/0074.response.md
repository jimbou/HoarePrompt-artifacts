The code prints the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the value of `elem`, twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.
Output: **[elem] [elem] (where elem is the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, without a newline character at the end)**
