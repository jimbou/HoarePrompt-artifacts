Output State: **sz is 2 * k, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng, elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable sz is equal to 2 times k, and the list rdb is empty. The other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remain unchanged.
