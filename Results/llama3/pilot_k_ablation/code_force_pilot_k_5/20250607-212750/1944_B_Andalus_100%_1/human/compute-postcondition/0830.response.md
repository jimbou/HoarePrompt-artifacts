Postcondition: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in ldb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the fourth element in ldb is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
