Output: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1). If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no action is taken, and the following is printed: an element from the list, separated by a space**
