Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing at least three integers from the sorted list `rgt` that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the third element in the list `rdb`, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 4 and the third element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, sz is 2 and the third element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. All variables retain their original values and properties, and the conditions regarding the printing of integers from the list `ldb` and the value of `sz` remain the same.
