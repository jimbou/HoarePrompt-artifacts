Output: **sz is either 2 * k, 2 * k + 1, 2 * k + 2, 2 * k + 3, 2 * k + 4, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 2 * k, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the last element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and nothing is printed**
