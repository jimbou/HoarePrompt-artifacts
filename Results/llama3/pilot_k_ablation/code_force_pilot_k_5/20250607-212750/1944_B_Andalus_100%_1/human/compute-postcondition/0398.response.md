Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 4, `ldb` is a list that contains the element at index `i` of `lft`**.

In this output state, the value of `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, and `stdin` remains unchanged. The value of `i` is still 4. The list `ldb` has been updated to include the element at index `i` (which is 4) of the list `lft`.
