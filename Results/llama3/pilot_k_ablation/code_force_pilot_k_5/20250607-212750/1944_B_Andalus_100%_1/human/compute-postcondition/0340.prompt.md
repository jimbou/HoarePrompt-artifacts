Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is 0, the loop terminates when sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, all elements in sng have been printed, and a blank line is printed
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *sz is either 0 or 2, rdb has at least one element, elem is the first element in rdb. If 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 2 and elem elem is printed. Otherwise, sz is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *sz is either 0, 2 or 4, rdb has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in rdb. If 2 * k - sz is greater or equal to 2, then "elem elem " is printed. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *sz is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, rdb has at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in rdb. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then elem elem is printed (where elem is the third element in rdb). Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: sz is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, rdb has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in rdb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the fourth element of rdb which is elem is printed twice. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, rdb has at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in rdb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the fifth element in rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
