Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1), and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus one. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise no action is taken, and the following is printed: an element from the list, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing two integers, the smallest and the second smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus two. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and an element from the list is printed, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing three integers, the smallest, the second smallest and the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus three. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken, and the value of elem is printed, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing four integers, the smallest, the second smallest, the third smallest and the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, and `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus four, and the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is `elem`, is printed, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing three integers, the smallest, the second smallest, and the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus five, and the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is `elem`, is printed, separated by a space, if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
