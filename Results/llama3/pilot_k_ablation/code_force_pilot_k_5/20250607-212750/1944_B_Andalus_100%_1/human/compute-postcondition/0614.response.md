The only variable in the loop head is variable elem and list ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ldb. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, sz is 0. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 element and the elem is the first element in the list.
State: **sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing at least 1 element, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in the list ldb**
