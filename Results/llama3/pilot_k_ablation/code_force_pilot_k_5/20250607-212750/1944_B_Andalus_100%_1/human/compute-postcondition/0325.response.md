Output State: **sz is either 2, 4 or 6, rdb has at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in rdb, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the third element in rdb)**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it can now be 2, 4, or 6. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list rdb still has at least 3 elements, and elem is still the third element in rdb. The print statement has already been executed before the code snippet, so the output "elem elem" is still present.
