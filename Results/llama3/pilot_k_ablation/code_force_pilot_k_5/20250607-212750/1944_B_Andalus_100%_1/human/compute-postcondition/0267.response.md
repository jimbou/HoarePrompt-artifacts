Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement.

The print statement is `print(elem, elem, end=' ')`. The variable `elem` is the seventh element in the list `ldb`. 

Since all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three. If `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then the seventh element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice separated by a space.

Therefore, the output will be the seventh element of the list `ldb` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[the seventh element of the list ldb] [the seventh element of the list ldb]**
