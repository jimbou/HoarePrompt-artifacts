Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the last element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and the last element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list rdb, printing each element twice, separated by a space, until it has either printed all the elements in the list rdb or until the condition 2 * k - sz is less than 2 is met. At this point, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
