Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, and nothing is printed
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing at least 1 element, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in rdb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the first element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, nothing is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `sz` is either 0, 2 or 4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the second element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice followed by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sz` is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the third element of `rdb` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`sz` is either 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fourth element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the fourth element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice followed by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`sz` is either 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 5 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fifth element in `rdb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the fifth element of `rdb` is printed twice, followed by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
