Postcondition: ***sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the third element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 3 elements. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2 and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
