Output State: **sz is either 3 or a multiple of 2 plus 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program execution has exited the innermost loop or conditional statement.
