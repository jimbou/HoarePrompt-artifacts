Postcondition: ***`sz` is increased by 2 * len(ldb), `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. If the current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
