Output State: **sz is either equal to 2 times k or a multiple of 2 plus 2 times k minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 times k elements, elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop.**

This output state means that the loop has executed until either sz has reached 2 times k or the list sng has been exhausted. The value of sz is either equal to 2 times k or a multiple of 2 plus 2 times k minus 1, depending on whether the loop terminated due to the condition sz >= 2 * k being met or not. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
