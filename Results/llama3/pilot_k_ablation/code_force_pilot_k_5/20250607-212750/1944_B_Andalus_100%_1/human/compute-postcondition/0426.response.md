The only variable in the loop head is `elem` and `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sz` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `n`, and if `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then `rdb` is a list that contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]`. For the loop to execute, `ldb` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the list.

State: **`sz` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list that contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list**
