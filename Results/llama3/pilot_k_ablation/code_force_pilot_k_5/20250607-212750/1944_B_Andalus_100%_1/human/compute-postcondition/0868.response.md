Postcondition: **sz is either 7, 9, 11, 13, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 7, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
