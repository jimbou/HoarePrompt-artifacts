Output State: **The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all the variables remain unchanged.**

In this output state, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all the variables remain unchanged. This means that the values of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, `elem`, `rdb`, `lft[i]`, `sz`, and `i` remain the same as before the execution of the code. The program also remains in the same state, with the same number of test cases minus two or more in the stdin, and the same output printed before the execution of the code.
