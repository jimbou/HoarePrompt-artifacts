Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the last integer in the list sng, sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed.**

The loop will execute until `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k` or until all elements in the list `sng` have been processed. After the loop finishes executing, the list `sng` will be empty, and the variable `sz` will be either `2 * k` or the largest even number less than `2 * k`. The other variables will remain unchanged.
