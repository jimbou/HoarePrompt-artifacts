Output: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least len(sng) elements, elem is the last element in the list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of the list sng which are elems have been printed, separated by a space, and a new line is printed**
