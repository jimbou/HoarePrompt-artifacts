To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `sng` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Since `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, we can conclude that the loop will execute.

For the loop to start, `elem` should be the first element in the `sng` list. We don't need to adjust any other states, as they are not relevant to the loop's execution.

State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 2 * len(ldb), n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in the sng list**
