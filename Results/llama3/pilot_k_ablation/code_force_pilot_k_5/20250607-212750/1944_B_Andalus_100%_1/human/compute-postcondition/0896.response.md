According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `rdb`. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` has at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and `elem` is the fourth element in `rdb`.

State: **sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the fourth element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 4 elements. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2 and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
