Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and n is greater than 1, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i], sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, elem is None, sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is 1, and the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list ldb now contains the current value of lft[i], which is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1].
