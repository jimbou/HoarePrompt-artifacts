State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 3, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or two elements, sng is empty or contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1. lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i]. Otherwise, ldb contains one element which is equal to lft[i]. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then sng is empty. Otherwise, sng contains the current element of lft at index i if i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1.**
