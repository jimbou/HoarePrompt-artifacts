Output State: **sz is 2 * k, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list sng, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb, ldb, sng, and elem remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement.
