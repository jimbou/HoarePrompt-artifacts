Output State: **`sz` is either 0 or 2, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement without modifying any variables.
