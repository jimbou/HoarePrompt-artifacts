Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 3, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is less than n and greater than or equal to 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of sng is increased by 1, and the new last element of sng is lft[i]. The other variables remain unchanged. The list sng now contains an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. The rest of the conditions and values of the variables are the same as in the initial state.
