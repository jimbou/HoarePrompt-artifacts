Output State: **sz is either 4 or a multiple of 2 plus 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we have broken out of a loop or if statement.
