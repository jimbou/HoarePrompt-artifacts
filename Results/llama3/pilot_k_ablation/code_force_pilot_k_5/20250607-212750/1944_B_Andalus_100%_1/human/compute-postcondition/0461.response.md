Output State: **`sz` is increased by 2 * len(ldb), `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. The current value of `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The value of `sz` is still greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, and `ldb` remains empty. The list `sng` still has at least one element, and `elem` is still the first element in that list.
