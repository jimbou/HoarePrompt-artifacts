Output State: **`sz` is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fourth element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
