Output State: **`sz` is either 2, 4, 6 or 8, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fourth element in `rdb`, and the fourth element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice followed by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, resulting in possible values of 2, 4, 6, or 8. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
