The code prints the fifth element of the list `sng`, followed by a space. The fifth element is referred to as `elem`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't determine its exact numerical value. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fifth element of the list `sng`, followed by a space.
Output: **the fifth element of the list sng (followed by a space)**
