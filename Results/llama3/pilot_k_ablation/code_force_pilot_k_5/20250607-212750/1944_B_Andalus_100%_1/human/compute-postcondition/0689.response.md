Output State: **sz is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing at least 1 element, ldb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in rdb, and the first element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, resulting in sz being equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true in the initial state are still true. The value of (2 * k - sz) is now greater than or equal to 0.
