Output State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest `min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1))` integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1), and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will print the smallest `min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1))` integers between 1 and n inclusive, separated by a space. The loop will break out of the most internal loop or if statement when `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
