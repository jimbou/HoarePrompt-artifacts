Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to n, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is equal to n. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list that contains the value of rgt[i - 1].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the value of i has been updated to n. The loop has iterated over the range from 1 to n, and the conditional statement inside the loop has appended the value of rgt[i] to the list rdb whenever rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1]. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
