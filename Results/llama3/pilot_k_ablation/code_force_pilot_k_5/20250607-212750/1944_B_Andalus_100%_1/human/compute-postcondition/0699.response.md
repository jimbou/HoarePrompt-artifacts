To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`. The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is `elem` and `rdb`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `elem` is the third element in the `rdb`.

State: **`sz` is either 0, 2 or 4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`.**
