To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `sng` is a list containing the smallest `min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1))` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and it must have at least 1 integer.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state of `elem` and `sng`. Since `elem` is the first integer in the list `sng`, we need to move to the next integer in the list. Therefore, `elem` should be the second integer in the list `sng`.

Additionally, since we are moving to the next integer in the list, the list `sng` should have at least 2 integers.

The other variables in the state, such as `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `stdin`, `i`, `rdb`, and `sz`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the second integer in the list `sng`, `sz` is increased by 1, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first integer of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, separated by a space.**
