Postcondition: ***`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list ldb. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the third element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
