To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`.

To execute the loop again, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` must be the second element in the list `sng`.

State: **sz is 2 * k + 1, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list sng**
