Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, sz is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable sz, which is assigned the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
