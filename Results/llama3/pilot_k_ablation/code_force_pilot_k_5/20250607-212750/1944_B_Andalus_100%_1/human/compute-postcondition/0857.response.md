The `print(elem, end=' ')` statement will print the value of `elem`, which is the third element in the list `sng`. Since the exact elements of `sng` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third element of `sng`.

Output: **the third element of the list sng**
