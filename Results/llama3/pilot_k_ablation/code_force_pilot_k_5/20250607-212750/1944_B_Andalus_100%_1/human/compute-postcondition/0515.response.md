The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `elem`. If `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `elem` is the next element in `rdb` and `rdb` has at least 1 more element.
State: **`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`.**
