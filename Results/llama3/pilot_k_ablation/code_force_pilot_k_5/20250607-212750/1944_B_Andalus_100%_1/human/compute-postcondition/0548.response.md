To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list has at least 4 elements, the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `sng` must have at least 4 elements and `elem` is the fourth element in the list `sng`.

State: **sz is 2 * k + 3, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the list sng**
