The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sng list.  If the list has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the elem is the fifth element in the list.
State: **sz is either 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 5 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fifth element in the sng list.**
