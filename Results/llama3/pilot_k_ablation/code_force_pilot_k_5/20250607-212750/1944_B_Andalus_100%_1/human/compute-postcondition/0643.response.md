Output State: **`sz` is either 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing one or more elements, `ldb` is a list containing at least 5 elements, `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fifth element in the list `ldb`, and the fifth element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, so it can now be 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. All other variables remain unchanged, and the fifth element of the list `ldb` is still printed twice, separated by a space.
