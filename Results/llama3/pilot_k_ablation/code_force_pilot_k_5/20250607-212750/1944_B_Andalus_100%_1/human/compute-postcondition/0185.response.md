Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 5 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fifth integer in the list `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 2. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth integer in the list `sng` is printed, which is `elem`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The program still has multiple test cases to process, and the current test case is still being processed. The lists `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `sng`, and `rdb` remain unchanged. The values of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `i`, and `elem` are still the same. The program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * `k`, and print the fifth integer in the list `sng`, which is `elem`.
