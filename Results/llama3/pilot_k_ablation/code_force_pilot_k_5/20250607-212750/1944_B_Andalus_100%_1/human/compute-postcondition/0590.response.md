To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n):`

The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is an integer greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5.

The state of other variables, such as `sz`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `rgt`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `lft`, and `sng`, is not affected by the loop head and remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`sz` is equal to the length of the list `sng`, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 5, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is empty, `ldb` is a list containing one, two or three elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains three elements: the first element is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the second element is equal to `lft[i]` and the third element is equal to `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n-1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the current element of `lft` at index `i`. Otherwise, `sng` is empty.**
