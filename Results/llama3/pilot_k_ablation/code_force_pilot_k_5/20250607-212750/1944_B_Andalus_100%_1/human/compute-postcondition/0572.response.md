Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is empty, sng contains the current element of lft at index i, elem is not defined, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. The first two elements of the sorted list lft are equal. The current value of i is either equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1.**

In this output state, the list sng now contains the current element of lft at index i, which is either equal to the first element of lft or not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1. The length of sng, sz, is updated accordingly. All other variables remain unchanged.
