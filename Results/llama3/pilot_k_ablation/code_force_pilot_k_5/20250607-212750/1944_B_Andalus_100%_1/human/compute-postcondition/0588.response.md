Postcondition: ***sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or two elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i]. Otherwise, ldb contains one element which is equal to lft[i].***
