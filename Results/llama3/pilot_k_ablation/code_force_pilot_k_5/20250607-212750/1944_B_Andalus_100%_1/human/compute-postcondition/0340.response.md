Output State: **sz is equal to 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, and all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable sz will be equal to 2 times k, indicating that all elements in the list rdb have been processed. The list rdb must have at least k elements to allow the loop to execute k times. Additionally, all elements in rdb will have been printed twice, separated by a space, as a result of the loop's execution.
