Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is equal to 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, and all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: sz is equal to 2 * k + 1, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list, and if sz is indeed greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng which is elem is printed, separated by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is equal to 2 * k + 2, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the list sng which is elem has been printed followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: sz is equal to 2 * k + 3, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the list sng which is elem is printed, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `sz` is equal to 2 * k + 4, `rdb` has at least k elements, all elements in `rdb` have been printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fourth element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, followed by a space

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `sz` is equal to 2 * k + 5, `rdb` has at least k elements, all elements in `rdb` have been printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list that must have at least 5 elements, `elem` is the fifth element in the list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
