Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 5 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and `n` is greater than 5, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is None, `sz` is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, `i` is 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, and `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only change being that `ldb` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `lft[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
