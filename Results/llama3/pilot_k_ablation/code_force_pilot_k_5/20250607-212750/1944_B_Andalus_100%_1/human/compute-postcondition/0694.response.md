The code prints the second element of the list `rdb` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end. The second element of `rdb` is referred to as `elem`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second element of `rdb` twice.

Output: **elem elem (where elem is the second element of the list rdb)**
