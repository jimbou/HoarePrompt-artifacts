The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is equal to n does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 1. 
State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng.**
