Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{2n} (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    lst = list(map(int, input().split()))
    lft = lst[:n]
    rgt = lst[n:]
    ldb = []
    rdb = []
    sng = []
    lft.sort()
    rgt.sort()
    if lft[0] != lft[1]:
        sng.append(lft[0])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
            ldb.append(lft[i])
        elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
            sng.append(lft[i])
    for i in range(1, n):
        if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
            rdb.append(rgt[i])
    sz = 0
    for elem in ldb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()
    sz = 0
    for elem in rdb:
        if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
            print(elem, elem, end=' ')
            sz += 2
        else:
            break
    for elem in sng:
        if sz >= 2 * k:
            break
        print(elem, end=' ')
        sz += 1
    print()


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the last integer in the list sng, sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least len(sng) elements, elem is the last element in the list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of the list sng which are elems have been printed, separated by a space, and a new line is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng, elem is the last element in the list sng, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the last element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of the list sng which are elem are printed, and nothing is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: sz is either equal to 2 times k or a multiple of 2 plus 2 times k minus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 times k elements, elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop, and a new line is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
