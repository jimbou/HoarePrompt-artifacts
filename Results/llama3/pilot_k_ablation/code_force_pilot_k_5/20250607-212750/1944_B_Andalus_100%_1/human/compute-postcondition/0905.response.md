Output State: **sz is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the fifth element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 5 elements.**

The value of sz is incremented by 2. Since sz was either 0 or 2, it is now 2 or 4. However, since the initial state specified that if 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2, we can conclude that sz is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
