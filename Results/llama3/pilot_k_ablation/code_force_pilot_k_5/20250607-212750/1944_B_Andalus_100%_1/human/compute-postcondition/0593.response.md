Postcondition: ***`sz` is equal to the length of the list `sng`, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 5, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is empty, `ldb` is a list containing one, two or three elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` contains three elements: the first element is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, the second element is equal to `lft[i]` and the third element is equal to `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n-1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` contains the current element of `lft` at index `i` and all the elements it had before. Otherwise, `sng` contains the current element of `lft` at index `i` and all the elements it had before, and `sz` is equal to the length of the list `sng` plus one.***
