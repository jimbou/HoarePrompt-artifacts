The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` must be either 3 or 4 and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1] and i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, otherwise ldb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of lft are not equal, otherwise sng is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive if the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, otherwise sng is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive if the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, otherwise sng is a list containing three integers which are the smallest three integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is either 3 or 4**
