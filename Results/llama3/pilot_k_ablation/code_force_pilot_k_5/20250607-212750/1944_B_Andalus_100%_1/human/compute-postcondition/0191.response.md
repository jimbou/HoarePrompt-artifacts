Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive but the first element is removed, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft, rdb is an empty list, elem is None, sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `sng` has been updated to include the smallest integer from `lft`, which is now removed from `lft`. All other variables remain unchanged.
