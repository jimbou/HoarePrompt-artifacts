Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 4, rdb is a list containing the integer at index 4 of the sorted list rgt.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the list `rdb` now contains the integer at index 4 of the sorted list `rgt`. The value of `i` is still 4, and all other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one.
