To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list `sng`.

State: **`sz` is increased by 1, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`**
