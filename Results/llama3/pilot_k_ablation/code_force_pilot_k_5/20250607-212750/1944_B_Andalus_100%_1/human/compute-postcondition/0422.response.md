Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 5, rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], rdb is a list with rgt[5] appended to it twice**

In this output state, the values of sz, n, k, lst, T, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of i is still 5, and rgt[i] is still equal to rgt[i - 1]. The only change is that rdb now has rgt[5] appended to it twice, since the code appends rgt[i] to rdb, and i is 5.
