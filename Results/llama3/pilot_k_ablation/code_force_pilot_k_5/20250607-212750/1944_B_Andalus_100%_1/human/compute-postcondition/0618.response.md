Output State: **sz is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing at least 1 element, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in the list ldb, (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0, and the first element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between.**

The value of sz is incremented by 2, so sz is now 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0, since sz is now 2. The first element of the list ldb, which is elem, is still printed twice with a space in between.
