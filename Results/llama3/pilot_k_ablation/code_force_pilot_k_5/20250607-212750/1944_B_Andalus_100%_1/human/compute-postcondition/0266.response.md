The only variable in the loop head is variable elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable elem and list ldb. If ldb has at least 7 elements the loop executes again for the seventh time. At the end of the last iteration, ldb has at least 6 elements, elem is the sixth element in the list ldb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 7 elements and the elem is the seventh element in the list.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 7 elements, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], elem is the seventh element in the list ldb, sz is either 0, 2, 4, or 6, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or three. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the seventh element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
