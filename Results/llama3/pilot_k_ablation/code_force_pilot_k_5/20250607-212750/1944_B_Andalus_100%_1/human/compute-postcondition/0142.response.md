The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable elem and the list rdb. If the list rdb has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least three integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the third element in the list rdb. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the elem is the fourth element in the list.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least four integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the fourth element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 6 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, sz is 4 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list rdb), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
