Output State: **sz is equal to 1 plus the length of the list sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is not defined, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is empty, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from the sorted list lft, elem is not defined, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.**

In this output state, the list sng now contains the smallest integer from the sorted list lft, and the length of sng has increased by 1. The variable sz is updated to reflect this change. The other variables remain unchanged.
