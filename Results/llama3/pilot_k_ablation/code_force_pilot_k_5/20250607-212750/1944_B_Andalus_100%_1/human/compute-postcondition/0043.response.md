Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 3, rdb is a list containing either two integers which are the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1] or one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1] and also contains rgt[i].**

In this output state, the value of rdb has been updated to include rgt[i], which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1]. The other variables remain unchanged.
