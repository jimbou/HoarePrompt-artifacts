Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1] and i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, otherwise ldb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive if the first two elements of lft are not equal, otherwise sng is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive if the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, otherwise sng is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive if the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, otherwise sng is a list containing three integers which are the smallest three integers between 1 and n inclusive and the last element of sng is lft[i], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is either 3 or 4.**

The code appends the value of lft[i] to the list sng. Since i is either 3 or 4, the last element of sng is now lft[3] or lft[4]. The other variables remain unchanged.
