Output State: **`sz` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the first element in `rdb`, nothing is printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, as the `break` statement only exits the innermost loop or if statement, without modifying any variables. The program state remains unchanged, with all variables holding their initial values, and the program control is transferred out of the innermost loop or if statement.
