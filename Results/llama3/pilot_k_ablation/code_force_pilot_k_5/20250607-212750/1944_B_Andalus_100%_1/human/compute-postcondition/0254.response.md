To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, which means the loop will iterate over the elements of the list `ldb`. The current state is:

* `ldb` is a list containing at least 3 elements
* `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state of `ldb` and `elem`. Since `ldb` is a list, we can't change its length, but we can change the current element being processed. Therefore, we need to increment the index of the current element in `ldb`.

The new state should be:

* `ldb` is a list containing at least 3 elements (no change)
* `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb` (incremented from the second element)

All other variables in the state remain unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.

State: **If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the first element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice separated by a space. Otherwise, the second element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice separated by a space. In both cases, `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`, `sz` is either 0 or 2, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]` and `rdb` contains the current value of `rgt[i]`.**
