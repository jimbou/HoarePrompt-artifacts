Output State: **sz is 2, rdb has at least one element, elem is the first element in rdb, 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the first element in rdb)**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it is now 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The value of k is still such that 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0, because sz has increased by 2. The print statement remains the same, printing the first element of rdb twice.
