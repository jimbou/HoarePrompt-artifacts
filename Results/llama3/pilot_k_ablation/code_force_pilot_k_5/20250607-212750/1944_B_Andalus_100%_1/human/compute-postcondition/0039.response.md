The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1].**
