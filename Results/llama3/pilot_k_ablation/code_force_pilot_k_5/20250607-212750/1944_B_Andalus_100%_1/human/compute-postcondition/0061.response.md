To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `elem` and the list `ldb`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `ldb`. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element of `ldb`.

For the loop to execute again, `ldb` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` must be the second element of `ldb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is either 0 or 2, `elem` is the second element of `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 2 and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
