To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to but does not include `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.**
