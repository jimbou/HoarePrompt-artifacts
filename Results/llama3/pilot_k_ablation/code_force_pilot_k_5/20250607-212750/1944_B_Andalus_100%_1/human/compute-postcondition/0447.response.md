The `print` statement is printing the value of `elem` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end.

`elem` is the fourth element in the list `ldb`. Since the precondition states that `ldb` has at least 4 elements, `elem` is a valid element in the list.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `elem` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[value of elem] [value of elem]**
