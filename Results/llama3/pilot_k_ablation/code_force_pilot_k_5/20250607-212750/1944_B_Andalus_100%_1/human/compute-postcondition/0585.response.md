The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, `i` is 4 and `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 4, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or two elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains two elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the second element is equal to lft[i] and sng is empty. Otherwise, ldb contains one element which is equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.**
