To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head `for elem in sng:`. The only variable in the loop head is `elem`, which is an element of the list `sng`. 

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `sng`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `sng` must have at least 2 elements and `elem` is the second element in the list.

State: **sz is equal to 2 * k + 1, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list**
