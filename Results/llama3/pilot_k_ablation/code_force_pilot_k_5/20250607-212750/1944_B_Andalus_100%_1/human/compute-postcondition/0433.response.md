Postcondition: ***`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `elem` are as initially described. If `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is set to 2 and the first element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between. If `2 * k - sz` is less than 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
