The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list rdb.  If the list has at least 1 more element the loop executes again for the next time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least 1 more element, elem is the next element in rdb. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 1 more element and the elem is the next next element in rdb.
State: **`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next next element in `rdb`.**
