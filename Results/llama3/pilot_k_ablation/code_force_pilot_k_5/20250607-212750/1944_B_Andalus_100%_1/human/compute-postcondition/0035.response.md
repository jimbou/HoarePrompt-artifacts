To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**
