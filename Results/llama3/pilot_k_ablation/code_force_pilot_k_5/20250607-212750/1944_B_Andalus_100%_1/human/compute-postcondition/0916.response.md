Output State: **sz is either 1 or a multiple of 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng which is elem is printed followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1. If sz was initially 0, it is now 1. If sz was a multiple of 2, it is now either still a multiple of 2 (if the initial value was 2) or not a multiple of 2 (if the initial value was greater than 2). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid, and if sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, the first element of the list sng (elem) is printed followed by a space.
