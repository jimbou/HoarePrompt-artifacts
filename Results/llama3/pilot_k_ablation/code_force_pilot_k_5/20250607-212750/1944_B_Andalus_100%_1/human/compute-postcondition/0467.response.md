Output State: **`sz` is increased by 2 * len(ldb) + 1, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered by breaking out of the loop or conditional statement.
