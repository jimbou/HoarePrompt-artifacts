Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, lft is a sorted list of integers with the first element removed, rgt is a sorted list of integers, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the first element of lft, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of sz remains the same as it was not affected by the code. The value of sng has changed as it now contains the first element of lft. The value of lft has also changed as its first element has been removed. The values of the other variables remain the same as they were not affected by the code.
