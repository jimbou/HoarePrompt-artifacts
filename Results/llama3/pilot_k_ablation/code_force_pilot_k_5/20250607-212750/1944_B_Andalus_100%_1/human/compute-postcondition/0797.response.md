The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 4, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rgt[i] is defined and equal to rgt[i - 1], and rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i]. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.**
