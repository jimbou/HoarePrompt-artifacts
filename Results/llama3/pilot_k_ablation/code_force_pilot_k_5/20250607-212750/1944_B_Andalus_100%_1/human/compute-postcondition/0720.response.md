Output State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 1 element, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in sng, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The break statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program flow is altered as it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement.
