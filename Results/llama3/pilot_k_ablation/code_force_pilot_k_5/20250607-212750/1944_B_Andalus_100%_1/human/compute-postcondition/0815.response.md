Output: **sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in ldb. If 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 2, then 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and this is printed: elem (which is the second element in ldb) twice, separated by a space, without a newline character at the end.**
