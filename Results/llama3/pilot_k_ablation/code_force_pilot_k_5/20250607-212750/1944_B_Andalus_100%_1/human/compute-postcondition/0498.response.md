Output: **`sz` is 0, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 element, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least min(len(sng), 2 * k - 2 * len(ldb)) elements, `elem` is the first element in the list `rdb`, and nothing is printed. The current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 2, and this is printed: the first element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, i.e., `elem elem`**
