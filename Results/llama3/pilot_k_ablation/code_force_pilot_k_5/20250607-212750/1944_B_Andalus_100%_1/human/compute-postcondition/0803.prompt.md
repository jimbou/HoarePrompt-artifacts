Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 1, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rgt[i] is defined and equal to rgt[i - 1], and rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 2, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rgt[i] is defined and equal to rgt[i - 1], and rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 3, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rgt[i] is defined and equal to rgt[i - 1], and rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i]. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 4, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i]. sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], and sng has an additional element which is lft[i] if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and elem is the second last element in sng. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 5, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i], sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], and sng has an additional element which is lft[i] if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and elem is the second last element in sng. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
