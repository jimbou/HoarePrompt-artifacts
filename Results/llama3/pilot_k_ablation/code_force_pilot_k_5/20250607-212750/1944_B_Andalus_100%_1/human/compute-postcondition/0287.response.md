Output State: **The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` is not empty and has at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in the list `sng`, `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `lft[i]` is appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` is appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sz` is now equal to 2 * k + 2, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed separated by a space.**

Note: The `break` statement only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and does not affect the values of any variables.
