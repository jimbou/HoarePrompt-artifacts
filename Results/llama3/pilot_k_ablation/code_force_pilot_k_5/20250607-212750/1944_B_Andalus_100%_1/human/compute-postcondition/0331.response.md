Output State: **sz is either 2, 4, 6 or 8, rdb has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in rdb, and the fourth element of rdb which is elem is printed twice**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it can now be 2, 4, 6, or 8. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The size of rdb is still at least 4 elements, elem is still the fourth element in rdb, and the fourth element of rdb (which is elem) is still printed twice.
