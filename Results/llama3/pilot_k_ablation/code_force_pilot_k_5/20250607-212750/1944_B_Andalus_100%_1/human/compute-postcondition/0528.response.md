According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `sng`. If `sng` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `elem` is the last element in the list `sng` that was printed, which means `sng` must have at least 1 element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `sng` to reflect this.

State: **sz is 2 * k, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list sng**
