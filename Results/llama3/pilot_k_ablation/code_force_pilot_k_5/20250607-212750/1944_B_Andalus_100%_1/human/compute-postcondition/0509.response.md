The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `rdb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `rdb`.  If the list has at least 1 more element the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `elem` is the first element in the list, `rdb` has at least 1 element. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 1 more element and the `elem` is the next element in the list.
State: **`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next element in `rdb`**
