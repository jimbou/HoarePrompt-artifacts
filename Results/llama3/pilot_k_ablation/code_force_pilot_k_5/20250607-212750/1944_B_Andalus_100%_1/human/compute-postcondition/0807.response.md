Based on the precondition, the code will print the first element of the list `ldb` twice, separated by a space.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`.
* The `print` statement is executed with `elem` as the first argument, which means it will print the value of `elem`.
* The second argument to the `print` statement is also `elem`, which means it will print the value of `elem` again.
* The `end=' '` argument specifies that a space should be printed between the two values.

Therefore, the output will be the first element of the list `ldb` printed twice, separated by a space.

Output: **[first element of ldb] [first element of ldb]**
