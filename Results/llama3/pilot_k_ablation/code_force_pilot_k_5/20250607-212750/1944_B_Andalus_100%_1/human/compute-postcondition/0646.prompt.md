Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].
Code of the loop:
for elem in ldb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing at least 1 element, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in the list ldb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the first element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sz` is either 0, 2 or 4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing one or more elements, `ldb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the second element in the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sz` is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing one or more elements, `ldb` is a list containing at least 3 elements, `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the third element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then the third element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, followed by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `sz` is either 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing one or more elements, `ldb` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fourth element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, the fourth element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`sz` is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing one or more elements, `ldb` is a list containing at least 5 elements, `sng` is a list containing one or more elements, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fifth element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the fifth element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
