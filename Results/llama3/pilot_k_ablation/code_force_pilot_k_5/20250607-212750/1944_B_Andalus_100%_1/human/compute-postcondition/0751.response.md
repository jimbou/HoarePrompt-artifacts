Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the last element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of the list sng which are elem are printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has executed until it has iterated over all elements in the list `sng`. The value of `sz` is now equal to the length of `sng`, and the last element of `sng` is stored in `elem`. If the condition `sz >= 2 * k` is met, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of `sng` have been printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
