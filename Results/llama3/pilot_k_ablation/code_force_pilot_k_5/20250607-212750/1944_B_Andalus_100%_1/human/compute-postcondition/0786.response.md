Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the size of the list `sng` is either equal to the initial size `sz` or has been updated to include additional elements from the sorted list `lft`. The integer `n` remains unchanged, and the other variables `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `rgt[i]`, and `rdb` retain their initial values. The loop variable `i` has reached its final value `n`. The list `ldb` may contain one or more elements equal to `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `sng` has additional elements from `lft` based on the conditions in the loop body.
