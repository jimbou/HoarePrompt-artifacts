Output State: **`sz` is increased by 1, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 5 elements, `elem` is the fifth element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made, and the fifth element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. If the new value of `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 times `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next statement, which would print the fifth element of the list `sng` followed by a space.
