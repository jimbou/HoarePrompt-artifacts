The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list  rdb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the rdb.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, rdb has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the elem is the trird element in the list.
State: **sz is either 0, 2 or 4, rdb has at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in rdb.**
