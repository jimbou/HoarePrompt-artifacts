Output State: **`sz` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `ldb` is a list containing one or more elements, `elem` is the first element in `ldb`, and `2 * k - sz` is less than 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `i`, `lft`, `ldb`, `elem`, and the condition `2 * k - sz` are unchanged.
