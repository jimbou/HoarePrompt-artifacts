Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2, `sng` is a list with an additional element `lft[2]`**

In this output state, the length of `sng` has increased by 1 due to the append operation, but the relationship between `sz` and the length of `sng` remains the same. The other variables, including `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, and `i`, are unchanged.
