Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i + 1`, and `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `T`, `_`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `lft`, `rgt`, `ldb`, `rdb`, and the condition of `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the list `sng` now contains two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive, and the value of `i` is incremented to 2.
