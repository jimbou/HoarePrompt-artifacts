Postcondition: ***sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, and elem is the second last element in sng. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
