Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, sng is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of T remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of _ also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified in the code. The values of n and k are assigned from the first line of the test case in stdin, which contains two integers. The value of lst is assigned from the second line of the test case in stdin, which contains 2n integers. The values of lft and rgt are assigned as the first n and last n elements of lst, respectively, and are sorted in ascending order. The values of ldb, rdb, and sng are initialized as empty lists. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been read and processed.
