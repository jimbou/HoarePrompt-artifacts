Output State: **sz is either 0, 2 or 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in ldb. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which does not change the values of any variables. However, it does cause the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside. The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.
