Output State: **sz is either 8, 10, 12, 14, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 8, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth element of the list sng which is elem is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: sz has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement and printing the fifth element of sng are still dependent on the values of sz and k.
