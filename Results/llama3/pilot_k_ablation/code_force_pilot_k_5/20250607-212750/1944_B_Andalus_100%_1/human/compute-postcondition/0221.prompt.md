Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, elem is None, sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and n is greater than 1, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing the current value of lft[i] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is an empty list, elem is None, sz is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. Otherwise, lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and `n` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is None, `sz` is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is None, `sz` is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`.

If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
