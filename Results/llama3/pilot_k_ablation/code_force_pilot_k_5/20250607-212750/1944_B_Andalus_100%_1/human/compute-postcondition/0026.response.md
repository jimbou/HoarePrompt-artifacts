Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing either one, two or three integers which are the smallest one, two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing either two, three or four integers which are the smallest two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is either 4 or 5. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either two or three integers which are the smallest two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive. If lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], ldb contains either one or two integers which are the smallest one or two integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either two, three or four integers which are the smallest two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive. If i is not equal to n - 1 and lft[i] is equal to lft[i + 1], sng contains either two or three integers which are the smallest two or three integers between 1 and n inclusive.**

The code appends the value of `lft[i]` to the list `sng`. Since `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `i` is either 4 or 5, `lft[i]` is an integer between 1 and `n` inclusive. The list `sng` now contains either two, three or four integers which are the smallest two, three or four integers between 1 and `n` inclusive. The other variables remain unchanged.
