Output: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 2 * len(ldb), n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times the value of k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng which is elem is printed, followed by a space.**
