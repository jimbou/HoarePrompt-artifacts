The code prints the fifth element of the list `rdb` twice, followed by a space. The fifth element of the list `rdb` is referred to as `elem`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the output. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fifth element of the list `rdb` twice, followed by a space.
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the fifth element of the list rdb)**
