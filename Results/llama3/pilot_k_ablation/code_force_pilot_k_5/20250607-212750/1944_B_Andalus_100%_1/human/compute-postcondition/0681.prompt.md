Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 2 * len(ldb), n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: sz is either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the sng list which is elem is printed followed by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: sz is either 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 2 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the second element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of the sng list is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: sz is either 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 3 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the third element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the third element of the sng list which is elem is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: sz is either 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 4 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fourth element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fourth element of the sng list which is elem is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: sz is either 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 5, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 5 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fifth element in the sng list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth element of the sng list which is elem is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
