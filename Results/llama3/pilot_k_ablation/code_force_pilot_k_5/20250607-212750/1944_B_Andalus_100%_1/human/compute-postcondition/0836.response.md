Postcondition: ***sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 5 elements, elem is the fifth element in ldb. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, the fifth element of ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
