Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 3, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the list sng and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The values of the variables do not change. The state of the variables sz, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb, ldb, sng, and elem remain the same as in the initial state.
