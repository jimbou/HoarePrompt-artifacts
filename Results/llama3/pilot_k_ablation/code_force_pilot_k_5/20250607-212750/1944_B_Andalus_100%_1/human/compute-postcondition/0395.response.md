Postcondition: ***`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 3. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[3]` appended to it.***
