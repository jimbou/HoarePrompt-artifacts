Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 3, rgt[i] is defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rdb contains an additional element which is equal to rgt[i].**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, except for rdb, which now contains an additional element equal to rgt[i]. The length of sng remains equal to sz. The values of n, k, T, i, and the contents of lst, stdin, ldb, and lft remain unchanged.
