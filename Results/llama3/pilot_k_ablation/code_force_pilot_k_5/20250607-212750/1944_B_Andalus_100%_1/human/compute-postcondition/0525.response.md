Output State: **`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next next element in `rdb`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, this output state means that all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement it was directly inside.
