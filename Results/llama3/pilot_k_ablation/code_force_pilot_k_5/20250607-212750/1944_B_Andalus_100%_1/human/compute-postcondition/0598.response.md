Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is defined and is equal to rgt[i - 1], rdb contains one element which is equal to rgt[i - 1], ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the list sng is still equal to sz. The values of n, k, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], lst, ldb, sng, lft, and rgt remain the same as before. The only change is that the list rdb now contains one element, which is equal to the value of rgt[i - 1].
