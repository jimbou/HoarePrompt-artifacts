The code prints the second element of the list `sng` separated by a space. Where `sng` is not empty and has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`. Since the exact `sng` list is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the second element of the list `sng`.
Output: **elem (where elem is the second element in the list sng)**
