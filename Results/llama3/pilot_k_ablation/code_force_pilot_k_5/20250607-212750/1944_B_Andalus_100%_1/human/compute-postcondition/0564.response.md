Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is not defined, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is empty, sng is empty, elem is not defined, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.**

The code snippet executes as follows:

1. The first line reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and k, respectively. This empties stdin.

2. The second line reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to lst. Since stdin is empty after the first line, this line does not read any integers, and lst becomes an empty list.

3. The third line assigns the first n elements of lst to lft. Since lst is empty, lft also becomes an empty list.

4. The fourth line assigns the remaining elements of lst (from index n to the end) to rgt. Since lst is empty, rgt also becomes an empty list.

5. The fifth and sixth lines initialize ldb and rdb as empty lists, respectively.

6. The seventh line initializes sng as an empty list.

7. The eighth line sorts lft in ascending order. Since lft is empty, this operation does not change anything.

8. The ninth line sorts rgt in ascending order. Since rgt is empty, this operation does not change anything.

After executing all the lines, the final state is as follows:

- sz is still equal to the length of the list sng, which is now empty.
- n and k are integers, but their values are not specified.
- lst is empty.
- T is still greater than 1.
- stdin is empty.
- i is not defined.
- rgt[i] is not defined.
- rdb is empty.
- ldb is empty.
- sng is empty.
- elem is not defined.
- lft is a sorted list of n integers, but since n is not specified, the length of lft is unknown. However, since lst is empty, lft is also empty.
- rgt is a sorted list of k integers, but since k is not specified, the length of rgt is unknown. However, since lst is empty, rgt is also empty.
