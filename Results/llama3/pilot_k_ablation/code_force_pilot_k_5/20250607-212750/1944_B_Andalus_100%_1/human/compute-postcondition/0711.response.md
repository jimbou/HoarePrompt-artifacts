To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `rdb`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `rdb` to iterate over. Since `elem` is the fourth element in `rdb` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to adjust the state of `rdb` to have at least one more element.

State: **`sz` is either 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 5 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fifth element in `rdb`.**
