The code prints the fifth element of the list `rdb` twice, followed by a space. Since the exact elements of the list `rdb` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fifth element of the list `rdb` twice, followed by a space.

Output: **[the fifth element of the list rdb], [the fifth element of the list rdb] (followed by a space)**
