To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, which means the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the list `ldb`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ldb` contains at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`.

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `ldb` and `elem`. Since `ldb` contains at least 2 elements, we can assume that there is a next element in the list. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `ldb` to have at least 2 elements, and `elem` to be the next element in the list.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `elem` is the second element in the list `ldb`, `sz` is either 0 or 2, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]` and `rdb` contains the current value of `rgt[i]`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then the first element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice separated by a space. If 2 * k - sz is less than 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
