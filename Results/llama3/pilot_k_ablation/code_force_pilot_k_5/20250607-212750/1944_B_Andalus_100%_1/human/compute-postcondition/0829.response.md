Output State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in ldb and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, lft, ldb, and elem remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
