To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `ldb`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least 1 element, the loop executes. 

State: **sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, elem is the first element in ldb**
