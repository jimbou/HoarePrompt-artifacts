Output State: **`sz` is either 2 or 4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the second element in `rdb`, and the second element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice followed by a space.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, so it is now either 2 or 4. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng`, `lft`, `rgt`, and `elem` are still valid.
