Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1), and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list ldb, printing each element twice, separated by a space. The size variable sz has been updated to be the minimum of 2 times k and 2 times the length of the list ldb. The list ldb is now empty, as all its elements have been processed by the loop. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
