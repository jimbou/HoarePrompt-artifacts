Output State: **sz is either 2, 4 or 6, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in ldb. If 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 2, then 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and this is printed: the third element in ldb which is elem, twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it can now be 2, 4, or 6. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding 2 times k minus sz is still valid, but now it is evaluated with the new value of sz. If the condition is not met, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the third element in ldb, which is elem, twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end.
