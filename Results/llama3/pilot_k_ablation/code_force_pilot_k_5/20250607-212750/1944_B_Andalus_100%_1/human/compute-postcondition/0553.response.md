Output State: **sz is 2 * k + 4, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in the list sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fourth element of the list sng which is elem is printed followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, resulting in sz being equal to 2 * k + 4. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to sz being greater than or equal to 2 * k still hold, leading to a break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the printing of the fourth element of the list sng (elem) followed by a space.
