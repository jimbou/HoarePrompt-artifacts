Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if rgt[i] == rgt[i - 1]:
        rdb.append(rgt[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 2 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 2. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing two integers which are the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1]. Otherwise, rdb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 3. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing two integers which are the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1]. Otherwise, rdb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive and is equal to rgt[i] and also equal to rgt[i - 1] and also contains rgt[i].

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 4. If the integer at index 4 of the sorted list rgt is equal to the integer at index 3 of the sorted list rgt, then rdb is a list containing the integer at index 4 of the sorted list rgt.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 5. If the sixth element of the sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive is equal to the fifth element, then rdb is a list containing one integer which is the sixth integer in the sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
