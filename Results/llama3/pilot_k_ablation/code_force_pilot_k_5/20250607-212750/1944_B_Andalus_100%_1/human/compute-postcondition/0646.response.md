Output State: **sz is either 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ..., 2 * len(ldb), n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `sz` will be twice the length of the list `ldb`, and the list `ldb` will be empty. All other variables will retain their initial values. The loop will have printed each element in the list `ldb` twice, separated by a space, until it has either printed all elements in `ldb` or until the condition `2 * k - sz >= 2` is no longer met.
