To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for elem in sng:`. The only objects in the loop head are `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time.

At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is the second element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in the list.

State: **sz is 2 * k + 2, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, rgt[i], rdb is empty, ldb, sng has at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list sng**
