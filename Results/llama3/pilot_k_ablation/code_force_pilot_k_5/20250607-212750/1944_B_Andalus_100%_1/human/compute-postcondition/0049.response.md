Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is a list containing one integer which is the sixth integer in the sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 5**

In this output state, the value of rdb has been updated to include the sixth integer in the sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, which is rgt[i]. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
