The only objects in the loop head are variables  elem and list  sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the sng list.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, sng has at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`sz` is increased by 2 * len(ldb) + 1, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`.**
