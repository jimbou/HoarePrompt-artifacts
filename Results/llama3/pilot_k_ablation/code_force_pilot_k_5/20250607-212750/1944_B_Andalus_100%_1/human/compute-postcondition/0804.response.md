Output State: **sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rdb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i]. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been changed to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions and relationships between the variables are still valid, but the value of sz is now explicitly set to 0.
