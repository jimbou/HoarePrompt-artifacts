Output State: **The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` is not empty and has at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list `sng`, `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `lft[i]` is appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` is appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sz` is now equal to 2 * k + 3, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space.**

In this output state, the program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all the variables maintain their previous values. The only change is that the program has exited the loop or if statement, and no new values are assigned to any variables.
