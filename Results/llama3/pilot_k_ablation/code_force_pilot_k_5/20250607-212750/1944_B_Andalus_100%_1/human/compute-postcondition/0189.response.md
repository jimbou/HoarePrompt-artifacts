The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `T`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `T`. If `_` is less than `T`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `T` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `T` must be greater than 1.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the last integer in the list sng, `sz` is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed**
