The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 4 or 5, `n` is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. So `i` is either 5 or 6 and `n` is greater than `i`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rdb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing either one, two, three or four integers which are the smallest one, two, three or four integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is either 5 or 6**
