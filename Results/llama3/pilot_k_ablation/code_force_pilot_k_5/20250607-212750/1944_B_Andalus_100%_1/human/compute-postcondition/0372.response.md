Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least len(sng) elements, elem is the last element in the list. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of the list sng which are elems have been printed, separated by a space.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `sz` will be equal to the length of the list `sng` plus `2 * k`. The list `rdb` will still have at least `k` elements, and all elements in `rdb` will have been printed twice, separated by a space. The list `sng` will have at least as many elements as its length, and `elem` will be the last element in the list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of the list `sng` will have been printed, separated by a space.
