Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input. If the first two elements of lft are different, then lft has its first element removed, and sng contains the first element of lft. Otherwise, no changes are made.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if lft[i] == lft[i - 1]:
        ldb.append(lft[i])
    elif i == n - 1 or lft[i] != lft[i + 1]:
        sng.append(lft[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is at least 2, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 1. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list with an additional element equal to `lft[i]`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` has one more element which is `lft[i]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 2. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list that contains the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` is a list with an additional element `lft[2]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 3. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list with an additional element which is `lft[3]`. If `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, `sng` has an additional element `lft[3]` appended to it.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 4, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 4. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list that contains the element at index `i` of `lft`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has one more element which is `lft[4]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 5. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list that contains the value of `lft[i]`. Otherwise, if `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element `lft[5]` appended to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
