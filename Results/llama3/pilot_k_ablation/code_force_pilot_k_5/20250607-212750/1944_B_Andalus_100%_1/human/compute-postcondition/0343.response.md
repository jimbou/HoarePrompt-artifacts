Output State: **sz is equal to 2 * k, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, rdb, sng, and elem remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement.
