To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for elem in rdb:`. This means that the loop iterates over the elements of the list `rdb`. Since `elem` is the variable being iterated over, it's the only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted.

According to the state at the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the third element in `rdb`. For the loop to execute again, `elem` needs to move to the next element in `rdb`. Since `rdb` is a list containing at least 2 elements, and `elem` is currently the third element, it means that `rdb` must have at least 4 elements for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the position of `elem` in `rdb`. Specifically, `elem` needs to become the fourth element in `rdb`.

State: **`sz` is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is a list containing at least 4 elements, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers, `elem` is the fourth element in `rdb`.**
