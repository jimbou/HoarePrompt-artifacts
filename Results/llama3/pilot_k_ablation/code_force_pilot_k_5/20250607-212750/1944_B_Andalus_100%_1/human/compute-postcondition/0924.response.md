Output State: **sz is either 2 or a multiple of 2 plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables sz, n, k, lst, T, stdin, i, lft, ldb, sng, elem, and rdb remain unchanged.
