Postcondition: ***`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged. If 2 * `k` - `sz` >= 2, then the next element in `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline character and `sz` is increased by 2. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
