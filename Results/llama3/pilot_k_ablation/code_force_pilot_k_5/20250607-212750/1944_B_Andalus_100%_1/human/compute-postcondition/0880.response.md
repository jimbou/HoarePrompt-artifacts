Output State: **sz is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the first element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 1 element, and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, and all other variables remain unchanged. The condition (2 * k - sz) >= 2 is no longer true, but the condition (2 * k - sz) >= 0 is still true.
