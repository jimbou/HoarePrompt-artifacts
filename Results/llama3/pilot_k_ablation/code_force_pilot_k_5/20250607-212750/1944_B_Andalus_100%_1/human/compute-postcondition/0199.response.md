Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and `n` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(`n`/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2`n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and `n` inclusive, `ldb` is an empty list, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is None, `sz` is either 2 * `k` or the largest even number less than 2 * `k`, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`. The current value of `i` is either equal to `n` - 1 or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`.***
