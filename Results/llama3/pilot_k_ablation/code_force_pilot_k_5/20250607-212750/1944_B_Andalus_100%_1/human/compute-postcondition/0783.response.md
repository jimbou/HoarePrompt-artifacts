Output State: **`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to 5 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng` and `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sz` is still either equal to the length of `sng`. The value of `n` is still an integer and must be at least 5. The value of `k` is still an integer. The list `lst` is still empty. The value of `T` is still greater than 0. The `stdin` is still empty. The value of `i` is still greater than or equal to 5 and less than `n`. The value of `rgt[i]` is still not defined. The list `rdb` is still empty. The list `lft` is still a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the list `ldb` is still a list containing one or more elements which are equal to `lft[i]`, and the list `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then the list `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and the value of `elem` is the second last element in `sng` and the list `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`.
