Postcondition: ***sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 1, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then rgt[i] is defined and equal to rgt[i - 1], and rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to rgt[i]. Otherwise, rgt[i] is not defined.***
