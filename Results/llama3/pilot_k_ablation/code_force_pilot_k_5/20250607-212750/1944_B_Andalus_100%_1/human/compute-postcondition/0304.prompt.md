Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], elem is the last element in the list ldb, sz is equal to 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. Otherwise, lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1]. ldb now contains an additional element which is the current value of lft[i]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng now contains the value of lft[i] appended to it. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then the current value of rgt[i] is equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1] and rdb contains the current value of rgt[i].
Code of the loop:
for elem in sng:
    if sz >= 2 * k:
        break
    print(elem, end=' ')
    sz += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, sng is not empty, elem is the first element in the list sng, rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], lft[i] is appended to ldb if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], and lft[i] is appended to sng if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and sz is equal to 2 * k + 1, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng which is elem is printed, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the first element of the list `sng` separated by a space if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, or continues execution if `sz` is less than `2 * k`. In either case, `T` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `_` remains 1, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` remains an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` remains a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` remains a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` remains not empty and has at least 2 elements, `elem` remains the second element in the list `sng`, `rdb` remains either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `lft[i]` remains appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` remains appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sz` is now equal to 2 * k + 2, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed separated by a space.

In either case, `T` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `_` remains 1, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` remains an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` remains a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` remains a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` remains not empty and has at least 3 elements, `elem` remains the third element in the list `sng`, `rdb` remains either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `lft[i]` remains appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` remains appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sz` is now equal to 2 * k + 3, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and prints the first element of the list `sng` separated by a space if `sz` is greater than or equal to `2 * k`, or continues execution if `sz` is less than `2 * k`. In either case, `T` remains a positive integer greater than 1, `_` remains 1, `n` remains an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` remains an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` remains a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` remains a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` remains a list containing at least 2 * k elements, `sng` remains not empty and has at least 4 elements, `elem` remains the fourth element in the list `sng`, `rdb` remains either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `lft[i]` remains appended to `ldb` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `lft[i]` remains appended to `sng` if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, and `sz` is now equal to 2 * k + 4, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more, and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space, and `elem` is printed separated by a space.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
