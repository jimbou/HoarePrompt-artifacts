The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 
State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 3, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is less than n and greater than or equal to 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. Otherwise, ldb is an empty list. If the first two elements of lft are not equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft, and elem is the second last element in sng. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng.**
