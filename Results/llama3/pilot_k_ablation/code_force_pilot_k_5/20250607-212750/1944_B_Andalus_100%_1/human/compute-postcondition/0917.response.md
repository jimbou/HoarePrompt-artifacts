To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to continue. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`, which means we can only adjust the state of `elem` and `sng`.

According to the loop head, the loop will continue as long as there are elements in `sng`. At the end of the previous iteration, `sng` must have at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element in the list `sng`. For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` should be the second element in the list `sng`.

State: **sz is either 1 or a multiple of 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop**
