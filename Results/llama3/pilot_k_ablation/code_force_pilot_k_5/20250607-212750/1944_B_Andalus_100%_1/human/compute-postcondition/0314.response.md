Output State: **sz is 0, rdb has at least one element, elem is the first element in rdb, (2 * k - sz < 2) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables sz, rdb, elem, and the condition (2 * k - sz < 2) remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
