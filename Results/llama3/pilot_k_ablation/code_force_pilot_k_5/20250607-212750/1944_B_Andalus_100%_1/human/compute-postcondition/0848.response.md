Output State: **sz is either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in sng, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
