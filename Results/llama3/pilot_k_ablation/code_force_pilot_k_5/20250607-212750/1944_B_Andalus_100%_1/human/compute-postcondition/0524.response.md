Output State: **`sz` is increased by 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb` has at least 1 more element, `ldb`, `sng` are unchanged, `elem` is the next next element in `rdb`, and this is printed: the next next element in `rdb` which is `elem` twice, separated by a space**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `sz` has increased by 2, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `sz` is now 2 more than its initial value. The rest of the variables, including `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, and `sng`, retain their initial values. Additionally, the next next element in `rdb`, which is `elem`, is still printed twice, separated by a space.
