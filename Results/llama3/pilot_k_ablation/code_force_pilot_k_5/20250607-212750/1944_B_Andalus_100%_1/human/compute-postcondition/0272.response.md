Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is a list containing the smallest integer from lft if lft[0] != lft[1], otherwise sng is an empty list and lft[i] is appended to it if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], elem is the last element in the list ldb, sz is equal to 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1]. Otherwise, lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1]. ldb now contains an additional element which is the current value of lft[i]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng now contains the value of lft[i] appended to it. If rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], then the current value of rgt[i] is equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1] and rdb contains the current value of rgt[i].**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed. The value of sz is equal to 2 * k, which means that the loop has executed k times, printing 2 * k elements from the list ldb. The value of elem is the last element in the list ldb, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
