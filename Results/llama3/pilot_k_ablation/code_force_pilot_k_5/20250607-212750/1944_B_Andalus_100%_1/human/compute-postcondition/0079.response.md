The only object in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ldb`.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `ldb` has at least 3 elements, `elem` is the fourth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and `elem` is the fifth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.
State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 4 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fifth smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive**
