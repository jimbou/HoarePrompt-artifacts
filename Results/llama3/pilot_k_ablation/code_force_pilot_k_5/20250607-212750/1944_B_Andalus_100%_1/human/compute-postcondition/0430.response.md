Output State: **`sz` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to `n`, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is equal to `n`, `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, `rdb` is a list that contains the value of `rgt[i - 1]`, `ldb` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the list, the current value of `(2 * k - sz)` is greater than or equal to 0, and the first element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between.**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 2, resulting in `sz` being equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and relationships. The condition `(2 * k - sz)` is now greater than or equal to 0, as `sz` has increased by 2. The first element of the list `ldb`, `elem`, has been printed twice with a space in between, as specified in the initial state.
