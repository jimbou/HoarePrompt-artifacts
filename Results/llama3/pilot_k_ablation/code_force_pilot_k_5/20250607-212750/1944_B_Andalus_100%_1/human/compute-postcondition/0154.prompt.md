Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest `min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1))` integers between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is 0, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least one integer from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the first element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 2 and the first element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least two integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the second element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 4 and the second element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, sz is 2 and the second element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least three integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the third element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is 6 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, sz is 4 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the third element in the list rdb), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least four integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the fourth element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is either 6 or 8 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, sz is either 4 or 6 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the third or fourth element in the list rdb), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is n - 1, rdb is a list containing at least five integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, elem is the fifth element in the list rdb, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is either 6, 8 or 10 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, sz is either 4 or 6 and the third element of the list rdb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space, and this is printed: elem elem (where elem is the third or fourth element in the list rdb), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
