Postcondition: ***`sz` is increased by at least 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 5 elements, `elem` is the fifth element in the list `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is increased by 4 and the fifth element of the list `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice, separated by a space. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
