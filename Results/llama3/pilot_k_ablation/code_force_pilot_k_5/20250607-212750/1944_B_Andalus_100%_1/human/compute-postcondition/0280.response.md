The only variable in the loop head is variable  elem and list sng, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list sng. If the list sng has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, sng is not empty, elem is the first element in the list sng. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list sng must have at least 2 elements and elem is the second element in the list sng.
State: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, sng is not empty and has at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in the list sng, rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], lft[i] is appended to ldb if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], and lft[i] is appended to sng if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and sz is equal to 2 * k + 1, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng which is elem is printed, separated by a space.**
