To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `sng` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` should be the third element in the list.

State: **sz is either 2 or a multiple of 2 plus 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in the list sng, rdb is a list that must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations of the loop**
