Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 1, rgt[i] is defined and equal to rgt[i - 1], rdb is a list containing one element which is equal to rgt[i], and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to lft[i], and sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1]. If i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng. The current value of rgt[i] is equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1].**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list rdb now contains one element, which is equal to the current value of rgt[i]. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
