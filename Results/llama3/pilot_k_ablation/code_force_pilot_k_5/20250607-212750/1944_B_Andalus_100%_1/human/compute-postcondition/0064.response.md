Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive and has at least 2 elements, `sng` is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `sz` is 4, `elem` is the second element of `ldb`. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 4 and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to -2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The second element of `ldb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, `elem` is the second smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.**

The code increments the value of `sz` by 2. Since `sz` was either 0 or 2, it is now either 2 or 4. However, given the condition that if 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then `sz` is 2 and the current value of `2 * k - sz` is greater than or equal to 0, we can conclude that `sz` is now 4. This is because if `sz` were 2, the condition would not be satisfied. Therefore, the value of `sz` is updated to 4.
