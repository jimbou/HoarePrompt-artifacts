Postcondition: ***sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is 2, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one element which is equal to lft[i] if the current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1], otherwise ldb is empty. If i is equal to n-1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i+1, then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty. lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers.***
