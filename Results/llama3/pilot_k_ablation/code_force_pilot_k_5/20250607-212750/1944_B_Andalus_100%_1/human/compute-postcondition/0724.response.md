Output State: **sz is either 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 1 element, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the first element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng which is elem is printed**

In natural language, the output state is: sz has been incremented by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The value of sz is now an odd number, and all other conditions and values of variables are the same as in the initial state.
