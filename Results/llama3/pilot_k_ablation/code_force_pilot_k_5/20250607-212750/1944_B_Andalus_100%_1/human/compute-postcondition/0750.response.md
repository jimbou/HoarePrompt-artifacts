Output State: **sz is either 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 5 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fifth element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth element of the list sng which is elem is printed**

The value of sz has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that were true before the code execution are still true, but the value of sz has changed.
