Output State: **sz is equal to the length of sng + 2 * k, n is greater than or equal to 2, k is an integer, lst is a list of integers, T is greater than 1, stdin contains no input, i is 1, rgt[i] is equal to rgt[i - 1], and rdb is a list containing the value of rgt[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of rgt[i] is appended to the list rdb. Since the current value of rgt[i] is equal to the current value of rgt[i - 1], the list rdb now contains the value of rgt[i - 1]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
