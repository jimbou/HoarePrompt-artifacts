Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, rdb is an empty list, if the first two elements of lft are not equal, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive. Otherwise, sng remains an empty list. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 1. The current value of lft[i] is equal to the current value of lft[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of ldb has been updated to include the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is the current value of lft[i]. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
