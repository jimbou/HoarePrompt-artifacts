Output State: **`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[i]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of `sng` has increased by one, with the new element being `lft[i]`. The value of `elem` has also changed to the second last element in `sng`. All other variables remain unchanged.
