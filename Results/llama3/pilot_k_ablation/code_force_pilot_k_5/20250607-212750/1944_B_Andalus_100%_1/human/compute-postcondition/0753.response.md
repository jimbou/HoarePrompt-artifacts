Output: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the last element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and all elements of the list sng which are elem are printed, and nothing is printed**
