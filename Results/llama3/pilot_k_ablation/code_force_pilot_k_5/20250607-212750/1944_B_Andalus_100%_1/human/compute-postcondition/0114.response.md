The code prints the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is `elem`, separated by a space, if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, otherwise, no action is taken.

Since `sz` is equal to the minimum of 2 * k and 2 * (n - 1) plus four, and `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `sz` will always be greater than or equal to 2 * k.

Therefore, the code will print the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is `elem`, separated by a space.

Output: **the third smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, which is elem, separated by a space**
