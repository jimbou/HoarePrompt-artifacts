Postcondition: ***`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is less than `n` and greater than or equal to 3, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, and `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one element which is equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`.***
