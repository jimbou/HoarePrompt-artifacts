Postcondition: ***`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list ldb. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, `sz` is increased by 2 and the second element in the list ldb which is elem is printed twice. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
