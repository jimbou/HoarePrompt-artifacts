To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer greater than 3 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. The value of `n` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 4 and less than or equal to 5 * 10^4, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing n - 1 integers which are the smallest n - 1 integers between 1 and n inclusive, sng is a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, i is 4**
