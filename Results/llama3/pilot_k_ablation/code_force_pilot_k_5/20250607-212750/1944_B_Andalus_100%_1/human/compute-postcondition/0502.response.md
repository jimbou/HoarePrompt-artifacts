Postcondition: ***`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `sng`, `elem` are as described in the precondition. If 2 * k - sz >= 2, then `sz` is 2 and the first element of the list `rdb` which is `elem` is printed twice with a space in between, i.e., `elem elem`. Otherwise, nothing is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
