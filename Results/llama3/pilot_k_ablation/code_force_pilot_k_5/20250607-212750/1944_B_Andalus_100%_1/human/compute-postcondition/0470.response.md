Output: **`sz` is increased by 2 * len(ldb) + 1, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` is empty, `sng` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list `sng`. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * `k`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. and the second element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed**
