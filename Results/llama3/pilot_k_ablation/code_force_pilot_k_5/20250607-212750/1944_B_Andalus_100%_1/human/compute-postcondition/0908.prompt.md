Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sz is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the last element in sng.
Code of the loop:
for elem in rdb:
    if 2 * k - sz >= 2:
        print(elem, elem, end=' ')
        sz += 2
    else:
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the first element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 1 element. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2 and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the second element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 2 elements. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2 and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the third element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 3 elements. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2 and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the fourth element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 4 elements. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2 and the current value of (2 * k - sz) is greater than or equal to 0. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: sz is either 0 or 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 * k elements, elem is the fifth element in rdb, rdb is a list that must have at least 5 elements. If 2 * k - sz is greater than or equal to 2, then sz is set to 2. Otherwise, sz remains 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
