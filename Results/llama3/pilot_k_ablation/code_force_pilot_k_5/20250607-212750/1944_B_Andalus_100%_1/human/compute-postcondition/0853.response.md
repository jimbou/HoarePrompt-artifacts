Output State: **sz is either 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 elements, elem is the second element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the second element of sng which is elem is printed**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it can now take on values 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 3. All other variables remain unchanged.
