The code prints the fifth element in the list `ldb` twice, followed by a space. The fifth element in `ldb` is denoted by `elem`. Since the exact value of `elem` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fifth element in `ldb` twice, followed by a space.
Output: **elem (which is the fifth element in the list ldb), elem (which is the fifth element in the list ldb), (space)**
