The code prints the fourth element of the list `rdb` twice, separated by a space. Since the exact elements of the list `rdb` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fourth element of the list `rdb` twice.

Output: **elem (the fourth element of the list rdb), elem (the fourth element of the list rdb)**
