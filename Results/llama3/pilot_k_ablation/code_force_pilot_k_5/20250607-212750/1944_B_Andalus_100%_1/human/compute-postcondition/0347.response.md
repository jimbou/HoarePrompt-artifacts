Output State: **sz is equal to 2 * k + 1, rdb has at least k elements, all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space, sng is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is the first element in the list, and if sz is indeed greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng which is elem is printed, separated by a space**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 1, resulting in sz being equal to 2 * k + 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The list rdb still has at least k elements, and all elements in rdb have been printed twice, separated by a space. The list sng still has at least 1 element, and elem is still the first element in the list. Additionally, since sz is indeed greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the first element of the list sng, which is elem, is printed, separated by a space.
