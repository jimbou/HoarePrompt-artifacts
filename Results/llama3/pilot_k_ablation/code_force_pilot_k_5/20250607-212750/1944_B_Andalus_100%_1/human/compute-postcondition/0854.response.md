To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `elem` is the second element in `sng`, and `sng` must have at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `sng` must have at least 3 elements, and `elem` must be the third element in `sng`.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **sz is either 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in sng**
