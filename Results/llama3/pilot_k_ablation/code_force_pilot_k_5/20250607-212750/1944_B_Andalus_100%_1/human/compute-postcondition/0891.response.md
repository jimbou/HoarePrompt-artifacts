The code prints the third element of the list `rdb` twice, separated by a space, without appending a newline character at the end. Since the exact elements of the list `rdb` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the third element of the list `rdb` twice.
Output: **elem elem (where elem is the third element of the list rdb)**
