Output State: **`sz` is increased by 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list ldb, and this is printed: the second element in the list ldb which is elem, and the second element in the list ldb which is elem**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been increased by 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The list `ldb` still has at least 2 elements, and `elem` is still the second element in the list `ldb`. The print statements are still the same, printing the second element in the list `ldb` which is `elem`, twice.
