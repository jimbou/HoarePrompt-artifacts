The code prints the fifth element in the list `sng`, which is `elem`. Since the exact elements of the list `sng` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fifth element of the list `sng`.

Output: **the fifth element of the list sng**
