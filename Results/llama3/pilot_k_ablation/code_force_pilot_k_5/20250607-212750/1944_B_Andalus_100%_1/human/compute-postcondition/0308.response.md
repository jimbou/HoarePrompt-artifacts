To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `rdb`. The loop will execute if `rdb` has at least one element. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `rdb` to have at least one element, and `elem` will be the first element in `rdb`.

State: **sz is 0, rdb has at least one element, elem is the first element in rdb**
