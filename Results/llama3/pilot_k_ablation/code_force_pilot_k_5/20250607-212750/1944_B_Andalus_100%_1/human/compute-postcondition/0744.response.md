Output State: **sz is either 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 4 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fourth element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 times k, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken., and the fourth element of the list sng which is elem has been printed followed by a space**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of sz has been incremented by 1, so it can now take on values 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and so on. All other variables remain unchanged. The fourth element of the list sng, which is elem, has been printed followed by a space. The condition to break out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the value of sz being greater than or equal to 2 times k.
