Output: **sz is either 5, 7, 9, 11, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 5, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 4 elements, elem is the fourth element in sng. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fourth element of the list sng which is elem is printed followed by a space**
