Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 3, `ldb` is a list with an additional element which is `lft[3]`.**

In this output state, the values of `sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 3. The list `ldb` has been modified by appending the element `lft[3]` to it.
