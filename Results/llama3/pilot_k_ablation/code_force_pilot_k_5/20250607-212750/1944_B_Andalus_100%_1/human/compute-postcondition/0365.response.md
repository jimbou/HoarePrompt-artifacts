Output State: **`sz` is equal to 2 * k + 4, `rdb` has at least k elements, all elements in `rdb` have been printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in the list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fourth element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed, followed by a space**

The code increments the value of `sz` by 1, so the new value of `sz` is 2 * k + 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still met, and the fourth element of the list `sng` is still printed, followed by a space.
