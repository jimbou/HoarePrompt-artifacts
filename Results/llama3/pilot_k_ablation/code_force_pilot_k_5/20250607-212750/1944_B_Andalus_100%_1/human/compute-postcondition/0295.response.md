Based on the precondition, the program has already broken out of the most internal loop or if statement and has printed the first element of the list `sng` separated by a space. The value of `sz` is now equal to `2 * k + 3`, which is greater than or equal to `2 * k`. The program has also printed all the integers from the list `ldb` twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed twice.

The print statement `print(elem, end=' ')` will print the second element of the list `sng`, which is `elem`, separated by a space. Since `elem` is the fourth element in the list `sng`, it will be printed as the next element in the sequence.

Output: **the fourth element of the list sng (which is elem) separated by a space**
