The only object in the loop head is variable  elem and list  ldb, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list ldb.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, the first element of the list ldb which is elem is printed twice with a space in between. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the elem is the second element in the list.
State: **`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the list ldb**
