To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for elem in sng:`.

Given that the fourth element of the list `sng` has been processed (printed followed by a space), for the loop to execute again, the list `sng` must have at least 5 elements, and `elem` should be the fifth element in `sng`.

The other variables (`sz`, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb`, `lft`, `rgt`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **sz is either 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and so on, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least 5 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fifth element in sng**
