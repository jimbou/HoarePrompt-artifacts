Output State: **sz is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, elem is the first element in ldb, and 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0.**

In this output state, the value of sz has been incremented by 2, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition that 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 2 is no longer true, but the condition that 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0 is still true.
