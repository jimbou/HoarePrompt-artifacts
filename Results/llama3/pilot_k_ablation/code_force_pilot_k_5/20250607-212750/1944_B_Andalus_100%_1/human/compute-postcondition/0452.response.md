To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for elem in ldb:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `elem` and `ldb`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `ldb` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `ldb` has at least 4 elements, and `elem` is the fourth element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `ldb` must have at least 5 elements, and `elem` must be the fifth element in the list.

State: **`sz` is increased by 2, `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, `stdin`, `i`, `rgt[i]`, `rdb`, `ldb` has at least 5 elements, `elem` is the fifth element in the list `ldb`**
