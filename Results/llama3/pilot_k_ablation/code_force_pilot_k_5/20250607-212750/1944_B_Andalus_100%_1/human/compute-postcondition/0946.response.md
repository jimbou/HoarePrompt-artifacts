Output State: **T is 0, _ is T, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is an empty list, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list that must have at least 2 times k elements, elem is the last element in the list sng that was printed, rdb is an empty list, sz is 2 times k, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, and a new line is printed for every test case.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop counter T becomes 0, the loop variable _ becomes equal to the initial value of T, the input list lst becomes empty, the lists ldb and rdb become empty, the list sng contains at least 2 times k elements, the variable elem becomes the last element in the list sng that was printed, the variable sz becomes equal to 2 times k, the input stream stdin becomes empty, the variable i becomes equal to n, and a new line is printed for every test case. The values of n, k, lft, and rgt remain unchanged.
