To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(1, n):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and `n` is greater than 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive and `n` is greater than 4, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is an empty list, `elem` is None, `sz` is either 2 * k or the largest even number less than 2 * k, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it.**
