Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 5, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 5, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, rdb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i], sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], and sng has an additional element which is lft[i] if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and elem is the second last element in sng.**

In this output state, the value of rgt[i] has been appended to the list rdb. The other variables remain unchanged. The list rdb now contains at least one more element, which is equal to rgt[i]. The length of sng is still either equal to sz or has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], and sng has an additional element which is lft[i] if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1]. The value of elem is still the second last element in sng.
