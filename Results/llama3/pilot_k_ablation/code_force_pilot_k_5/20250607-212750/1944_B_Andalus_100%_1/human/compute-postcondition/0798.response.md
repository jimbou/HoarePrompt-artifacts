Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer that must be greater than 4, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is 4, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, rdb is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i], sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], and sng has an additional element which is lft[i] if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and elem is the second last element in sng.**

In this output state, the code has appended the value of rgt[i] to the list rdb. The other variables remain unchanged. The list rdb now contains one or more elements which are equal to rgt[i] and also contains the value of rgt[i]. The list sng has an additional element which is equal to lft[i] and also equal to lft[i - 1] if lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], and sng has an additional element which is lft[i] if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1]. The variable elem is the second last element in sng.
