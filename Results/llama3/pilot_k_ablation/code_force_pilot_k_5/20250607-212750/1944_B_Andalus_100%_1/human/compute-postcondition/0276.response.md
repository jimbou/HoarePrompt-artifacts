Postcondition: **T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is a list containing at least 2 * k elements, sng is not empty, elem is the first element in the list sng, rdb is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of rgt[i], lft[i] is appended to ldb if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1], and lft[i] is appended to sng if lft[i] is not equal to lft[i - 1] and i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], and sz is equal to 2 * k, and all the integers from the list ldb are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and i is n - 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two or more. If sz is greater than or equal to 2 * k, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
