The code prints the fourth element in the list `rdb` twice, followed by a space. Since the exact elements in the list `rdb` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `elem`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the fourth element in the list `rdb` twice, followed by a space.
Output: **elem (where elem is the fourth element in the list rdb), elem (where elem is the fourth element in the list rdb), (space)**
