Output State: **`sz` is equal to 2 * k + 5, `rdb` has at least k elements, all elements in `rdb` have been printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list that must have at least 5 elements, `elem` is the fifth element in the list. If `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the fifth element of the list `sng` which is `elem` is printed followed by a space**

In this output state, the value of `sz` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `sz` being equal to 2 * k + 5. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The program still breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `sz` is greater than or equal to 2 * k, and the fifth element of the list `sng` is printed followed by a space.
