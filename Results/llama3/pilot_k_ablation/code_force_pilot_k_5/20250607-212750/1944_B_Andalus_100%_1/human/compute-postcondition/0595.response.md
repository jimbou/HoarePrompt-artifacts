Output State: **sz is equal to the length of the list sng, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is empty, ldb is a list containing one or more elements, sng is a list containing one or more elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers. If lft[i] is equal to lft[i - 1], then ldb contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to lft[i - 1] and the rest of the elements are equal to lft[i]. If i is equal to n-1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng contains the current element of lft at index i. Otherwise, sng is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The variable `sz` is equal to the length of the list `sng`.
- The variable `n` is an integer.
- The variable `k` is an integer.
- The list `lst` is empty.
- The variable `T` is greater than 1.
- The variable `stdin` is empty.
- The variable `i` is equal to `n`.
- The variable `rgt[i]` is not defined.
- The list `rdb` is empty.
- The list `ldb` contains one or more elements.
- The list `sng` contains one or more elements.
- The list `lft` is a sorted list of `n` integers.
- The list `rgt` is a sorted list of `k` integers.

If the current element of `lft` at index `i` is equal to the previous element of `lft` at index `i-1`, then the list `ldb` contains multiple elements: the first element is equal to the previous element of `lft` at index `i-1` and the rest of the elements are equal to the current element of `lft` at index `i`.

If `i` is equal to `n-1` or the current element of `lft` at index `i` is not equal to the next element of `lft` at index `i+1`, then the list `sng` contains the current element of `lft` at index `i`. Otherwise, the list `sng` is empty.
