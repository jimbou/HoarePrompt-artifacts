To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `elem` and `sng`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `sng`. If the list has at least 4 integers, the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `sng` has at least 3 integers, `elem` is the third integer in the list `sng`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `sng` must have at least 4 integers and `elem` is the fourth integer in the list `sng`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `lft` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing all the integers that were previously printed twice, separated by a space, `sng` is a list containing the smallest min(2 * k, 2 * (n - 1)) integers between 1 and n inclusive that must have at least 4 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is n - 1, `rdb` is a list containing all the integers from the sorted list rgt that are equal to the integer before them, `elem` is the fourth integer in the list `sng`, and `sz` is increased by 1**
