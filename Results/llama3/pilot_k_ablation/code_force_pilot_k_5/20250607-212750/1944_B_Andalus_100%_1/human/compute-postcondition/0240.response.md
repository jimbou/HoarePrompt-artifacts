The only variable in the loop head is variable `elem` and list `ldb`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ldb`. If `ldb` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]` if `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, otherwise `ldb` is a list containing the current value of `lft[i]`. So for the loop to be executed, `ldb` must have at least 1 element and `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`.

State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 1, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer between 3 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, `k` is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, `lst` is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `rgt` is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, `ldb` is a list containing at least 1 element, `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is a list containing the smallest integer from `lft` if `lft[0]` != `lft[1]`, otherwise `sng` is an empty list and `lft[i]` is appended to it if `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]`, `rdb` is either an empty list or a list containing the current value of `rgt[i]`, `elem` is the first element in the list `ldb`, `sz` is 0, and all the integers from the list `ldb` are printed twice, separated by a space, and an empty line is printed, and an empty line is printed, and `i` is `n - 1`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then the current value of `lft[i]` is equal to the current value of `lft[i - 1]`. Otherwise, `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i - 1]` and the current value of `i` is either equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`. `ldb` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `lft[i]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` now contains the value of `lft[i]` appended to it. If `rgt[i]` is equal to `rgt[i - 1]`, then the current value of `rgt[i]` is equal to the current value of `rgt[i - 1]` and `rdb` contains the current value of `rgt[i]`.**
