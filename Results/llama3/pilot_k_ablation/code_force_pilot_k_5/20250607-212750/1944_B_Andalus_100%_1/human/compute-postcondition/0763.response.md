Output State: **sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz and has an additional element which is lft[i], lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, and elem is the second last element in sng.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of sz is still either equal to the length of sng, n is still an integer and must be at least 2, k is still an integer, lst is still empty, T is still greater than 0, stdin is still empty, i is still either equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], rgt[i] is still not defined, rdb is still an empty list, ldb is still an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz and has an additional element which is lft[i], lft is still a sorted list of n-1 integers, and elem is still the second last element in sng.
