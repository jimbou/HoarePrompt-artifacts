Postcondition: ***sz is either 0, 2, 4 or 6, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, i is equal to n, lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers, ldb is a list containing at least 3 elements, elem is the third element in ldb. If 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 2, then 2 times k minus sz is greater than or equal to 0 and the third element in ldb which is elem is printed twice, separated by a space, without a newline at the end. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
