Output State: **sz is either 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ..., 2 * len(ldb) + 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 1, i is equal to n, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is a list containing one or more elements, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list containing at least 4 elements, lft is a sorted list of n integers, rgt is a sorted list of k integers, elem is the fourth element in the sng list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
