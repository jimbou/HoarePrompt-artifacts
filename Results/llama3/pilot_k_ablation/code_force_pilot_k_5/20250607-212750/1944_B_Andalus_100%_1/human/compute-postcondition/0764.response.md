Postcondition: ***sz is either equal to the length of sng, n is an integer and must be at least 2, k is an integer, lst is empty, T is greater than 0, stdin is empty, rgt[i] is not defined, rdb is an empty list, ldb is an empty list, sng is a list with at least as many elements as sz, and lft is a sorted list of n-1 integers. If the first two elements of lft are equal, then sng has an additional element which is the first element of lft, and elem is the second last element in sng. Otherwise, if i is equal to n - 1 or lft[i] is not equal to lft[i + 1], then sng has an additional element which is lft[i], and elem is the second last element in sng.***
