The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than `n`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is greater than or equal to 5 and less than `n` and `n` must be at least 5.
State: **`sz` is either equal to the length of `sng`, `n` is an integer and must be at least 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is empty, `T` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty, `i` is greater than or equal to 5 and less than `n`, `rgt[i]` is not defined, `rdb` is an empty list, `lft` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers. If `lft[i]` is equal to `lft[i - 1]`, then `ldb` is a list containing one or more elements which are equal to `lft[i]`, and `sng` has an additional element which is equal to `lft[i]` and also equal to `lft[i - 1]`. If `i` is equal to `n - 1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i + 1]`, then `sng` has an additional element which is `lft[i]`, and `elem` is the second last element in `sng`.**
