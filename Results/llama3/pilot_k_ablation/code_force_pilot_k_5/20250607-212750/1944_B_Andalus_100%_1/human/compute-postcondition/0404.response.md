Output State: **`sz` is equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`, `n` is greater than 5, `k` is an integer, `lst` is a list of integers, `T` is greater than 1, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is 5, `sng` has an additional element `lft[5]` appended to it**

In this output state, the value of `sz` remains the same because the length of `sng` has increased by 1, but `sz` is still equal to the length of `sng` + 2 * `k`. The values of `n`, `k`, `lst`, `T`, and `stdin` are not affected by the code. The value of `i` is still 5. The list `sng` has been modified by appending the element `lft[5]` to it.
