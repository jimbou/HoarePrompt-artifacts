Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer between 2 and 5 * 10^4 inclusive, k is an integer between 1 and floor(n/2) inclusive, lst is a list of 2n integers between 1 and n inclusive, lft is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, rgt is a sorted list of n integers between 1 and n inclusive, ldb is an empty list, rdb is an empty list, if the current value of i is either equal to n - 1 or the current element of lft at index i is not equal to the next element of lft at index i + 1, then sng is a list containing two integers which are the smallest two integers between 1 and n inclusive, and i is 2. Otherwise, sng remains a list containing one integer which is the smallest integer between 1 and n inclusive.***
