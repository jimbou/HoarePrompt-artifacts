Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input for each test case, which consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `k`, and the second line contains `2n` integers.
2. The program correctly separates the `2n` integers into two lists: `lft` and `rgt`, each containing `n` integers.
3. The program correctly identifies duplicates in `lft` and `rgt` and stores them in separate lists: `ldb` and `rdb`, respectively.
4. The program correctly identifies single occurrences in `lft` and stores them in the list `sng`.
5. The program correctly prints the required sequence of integers for each test case. It prioritizes duplicates from `ldb` and `rdb`, followed by single occurrences from `sng`, until a total of `2k` integers are printed.
6. The program correctly handles the case where `lft[0]` is not equal to `lft[1]`, which means that the first element of `lft` is a single occurrence.
7. The program correctly handles the case where `i` is equal to `n-1` or `lft[i]` is not equal to `lft[i+1]`, which means that the current element of `lft` is a single occurrence.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required logic to solve the problem, and its execution states match the expected behavior.

Correctness: **True**
