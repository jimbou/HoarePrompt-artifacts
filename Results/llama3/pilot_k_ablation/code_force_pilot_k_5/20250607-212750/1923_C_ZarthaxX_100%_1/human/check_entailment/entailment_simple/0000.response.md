Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a given subarray is good or not based on the conditions provided in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of the correctness of the program:

1. The program correctly initializes the `ones` and `sum` arrays to keep track of the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray, respectively.

2. The program correctly calculates the number of ones and the sum of the elements in the subarray for each query.

3. The program correctly checks if the subarray is good or not based on the conditions provided in the problem description. It checks if the sum of the elements in the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the number of ones plus the length of the subarray minus the number of ones. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

4. The program correctly handles the edge case where the subarray has only one element. In this case, it prints 'NO' because a single element cannot be rearranged to meet the conditions.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
