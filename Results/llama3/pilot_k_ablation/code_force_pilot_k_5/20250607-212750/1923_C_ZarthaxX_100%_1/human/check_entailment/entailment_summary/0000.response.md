Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the given conditions. 

The program first calculates the prefix sum of the array and the prefix count of 1's in the array. Then, for each query, it calculates the sum of the subarray and the count of 1's in the subarray using the prefix sum and prefix count arrays. 

The program then checks if the sum of the subarray is greater than or equal to twice the count of 1's in the subarray plus the length of the subarray minus the count of 1's in the subarray. This condition is derived from the given conditions in the problem statement. 

If the condition is met, the program prints 'YES', indicating that the subarray is good. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

The program correctly handles the case where the query range has only one element, in which case it always prints 'NO'. 

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
