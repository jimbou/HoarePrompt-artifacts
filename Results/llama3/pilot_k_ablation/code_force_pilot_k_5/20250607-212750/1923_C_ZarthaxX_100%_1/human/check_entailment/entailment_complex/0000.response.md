Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a subarray is good based on the conditions provided in the problem description. The program first calculates the prefix sum and the count of 1's up to each index in the array. Then, for each query, it calculates the sum and count of 1's in the range [l, r] using the prefix sum and count arrays. Finally, it checks if the sum of the integers in the range is greater than or equal to twice the number of 1's in the range plus the length of the range minus the number of 1's in the range. If the condition is met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program handles the edge case where l == r correctly by printing 'NO' immediately.

Correctness: **True**
