Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is equal to the sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `nums`, `ones`, `sum`, `i`, and `_` remain unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` are assigned the values of two integers from the input, which are separated by a space. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, since one test case has been processed.
