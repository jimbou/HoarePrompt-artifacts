Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 2, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-8 test cases, _ is 2.**

The code snippet calculates the number of 1's and the sum of the elements in the list `nums` within the range from index `l-1` to `r-1`. The variables `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` are updated with these values, respectively. No other variables are affected by the code.
