Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 1, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-8 test cases, _ is 1.**

The code calculates the number of 1's and the sum of the numbers in the range from index l-1 to r-1 in the list nums. The variable onesInRange is updated to be the difference between the number of 1's up to index r and the number of 1's up to index l-1. Similarly, the variable sumInRange is updated to be the difference between the sum up to index r and the sum up to index l-1. No other variables are affected.
