Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:

- The value of 'n' remains unchanged, which is an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of 'q' remains unchanged, which is an integer.
- The value of 'nums' remains unchanged, which is a list of 'n' integers.
- The value of 'ones' is a list of 'n+1' integers, where each element 'ones[i]' represents the count of 1's in the 'nums' list from index 0 to 'i-1'.
- The value of 'sum' is a list of 'n+1' integers, where each element 'sum[i]' represents the sum of the 'nums' list from index 0 to 'i-1'.
- The value of 'i' is equal to 'n', indicating that the loop has executed 'n' times.
- The state of 'stdin' remains unchanged, containing 't-1' test cases.
