The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `q`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `q`. If `_` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `q` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer greater than 2, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is equal to the sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `r` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index `l-1` to `r-1`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to the sum of `nums` from index `l-1` to `r-1`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `_` is 2**
