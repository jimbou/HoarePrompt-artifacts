To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `q`. The loop will execute as long as `q` is greater than 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is equal to the sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `_` is 0**
