The only variable in the loop head is variable  _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _ and q. If _ is less than q, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, q is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ is increased by 1 so _ is 1 and for the loop to execute again q must be greater than 1.
State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 1, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-3 test cases, _ is 1**
