To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `i` and the range `n + 1`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[1]` is equal to 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is 0, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**
