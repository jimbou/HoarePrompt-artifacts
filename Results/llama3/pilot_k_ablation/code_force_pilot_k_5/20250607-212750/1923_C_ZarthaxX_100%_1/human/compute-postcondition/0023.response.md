Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0. Additionally, 2 times the number of 1's in the range from l-1 to r-1 plus the length of the range minus the number of 1's in the range is greater than the sum of the numbers in the range from l-1 to r-1***
