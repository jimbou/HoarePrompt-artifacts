Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is equal to 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise ones[1] is 0, ones[2] is equal to ones[1] plus 1 if nums[1] is 1, otherwise ones[2] is equal to ones[1], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0], sum[2] is equal to sum[1] plus nums[1], i is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `q` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The list `nums` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.

The list `ones` is modified by the code. The value of `ones[2]` is calculated based on the value of `nums[1]`. If `nums[1]` is 1, then `ones[2]` is equal to `ones[1]` plus 1, otherwise `ones[2]` is equal to `ones[1]`.

The list `sum` is also modified by the code. The value of `sum[2]` is calculated based on the value of `nums[1]`. The value of `sum[2]` is equal to `sum[1]` plus `nums[1]`.

The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

The state of `stdin` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
