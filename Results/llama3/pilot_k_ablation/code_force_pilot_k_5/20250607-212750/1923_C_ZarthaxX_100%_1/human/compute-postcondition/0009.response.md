The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 5, `q` is an integer, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[1]` is equal to 1 if `nums[0]` is 1, otherwise `ones[1]` is 0, `ones[2]` is equal to `ones[1]` plus 1 if `nums[1]` is 1, otherwise `ones[2]` is equal to `ones[1]`, `ones[3]` is equal to `ones[2]` plus 1 if `nums[2]` is 1, otherwise `ones[3]` is equal to `ones[2]`, `ones[4]` is equal to `ones[3]` plus 1 if `nums[3]` is 1, otherwise `ones[4]` is equal to `ones[3]`, `ones[5]` is equal to `ones[4]` plus 1 if `nums[4]` is 1, otherwise `ones[5]` is equal to `ones[4]`, `ones[6]` is equal to `ones[5]` plus 1 if `nums[5]` is 1, otherwise `ones[6]` is equal to `ones[5]`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[1]` is equal to `nums[0]`, `sum[2]` is equal to `sum[1]` plus `nums[1]`, `sum[3]` is equal to `sum[2]` plus `nums[2]`, `sum[4]` is equal to `sum[3]` plus `nums[3]`, `sum[5]` is equal to `sum[4]` plus `nums[4]`, `sum[6]` is equal to `sum[5]` plus `nums[5]`, `i` is 6, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
