Output State: **n is an integer greater than 5, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is equal to 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise ones[1] is 0, ones[2] is equal to ones[1] plus 1 if nums[1] is 1, otherwise ones[2] is equal to ones[1], ones[3] is equal to ones[2] plus 1 if nums[2] is 1, otherwise ones[3] is equal to ones[2], ones[4] is equal to ones[3] plus 1 if nums[3] is 1, otherwise ones[4] is equal to ones[3], ones[5] is equal to ones[4] plus 1 if nums[4] is 1, otherwise ones[5] is equal to ones[4], ones[6] is equal to ones[5] plus 1 if nums[5] is 1, otherwise ones[6] is equal to ones[5], ones[7] is equal to ones[6] plus 1 if nums[6] is 1, otherwise ones[7] is equal to ones[6], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0], sum[2] is equal to sum[1] plus nums[1], sum[3] is equal to sum[2] plus nums[2], sum[4] is equal to sum[3] plus nums[3], sum[5] is equal to sum[4] plus nums[4], sum[6] is equal to sum[5] plus nums[5], sum[7] is equal to sum[6] plus nums[6], i is 7, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the code has updated the values of `ones` and `sum` lists by considering the values of `nums` list up to index 6. The value of `i` has also been incremented to 7. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
