Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer equal to 0, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-q test cases, _ is q.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of q will be 0, indicating that all queries have been processed. The values of n, nums, ones, sum, and i remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop. The value of _ will be equal to the initial value of q, indicating that the loop has executed q times. The number of test cases in stdin will be reduced by q, as each iteration of the loop processes one test case.
