Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is equal to 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise ones[1] is 0, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0], i is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` and `q` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The list `nums` also remains unchanged. The list `ones` is modified at index `i` (which is 1), where its value becomes the value at index `i-1` (which is 0) plus 1 if the value at index `i-1` in `nums` is 1, otherwise it remains the same as the value at index `i-1` in `ones`. The list `sum` is also modified at index `i` (which is 1), where its value becomes the value at index `i-1` (which is 0) plus the value at index `i-1` in `nums`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The state of stdin remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code.
