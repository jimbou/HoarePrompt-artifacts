Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is equal to 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise ones[1] is 0, ones[2] is equal to ones[1] plus 1 if nums[1] is 1, otherwise ones[2] is equal to ones[1], ones[3] is equal to ones[2] plus 1 if nums[2] is 1, otherwise ones[3] is equal to ones[2], ones[4] is equal to ones[3] plus 1 if nums[3] is 1, otherwise ones[4] is equal to ones[3], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0], sum[2] is equal to sum[1] plus nums[1], sum[3] is equal to sum[2] plus nums[2], sum[4] is equal to sum[3] plus nums[3], i is 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
