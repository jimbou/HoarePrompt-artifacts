The only variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and n. If i is less than n+1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, n is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **n is an integer greater than 2, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[1] is equal to 1 if nums[0] is 1, otherwise ones[1] is 0, ones[2] is equal to ones[1] plus 1 if nums[1] is 1, otherwise ones[2] is equal to ones[1], ones[3] is equal to ones[2] plus 1 if nums[2] is 1, otherwise ones[3] is equal to ones[2], sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[1] is equal to nums[0], sum[2] is equal to sum[1] plus nums[1], sum[3] is equal to sum[2] plus nums[2], i is 3, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
