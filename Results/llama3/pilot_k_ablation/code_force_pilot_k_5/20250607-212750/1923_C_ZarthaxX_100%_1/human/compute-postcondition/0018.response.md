Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is equal to the sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, stdin contains `t-2` test cases, `_` is 0. If `l` is equal to `r`, 'NO' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution of the program continues.***
