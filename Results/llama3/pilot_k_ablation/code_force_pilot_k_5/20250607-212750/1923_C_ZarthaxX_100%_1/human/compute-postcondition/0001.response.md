According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 1.
State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros, i is 1**
