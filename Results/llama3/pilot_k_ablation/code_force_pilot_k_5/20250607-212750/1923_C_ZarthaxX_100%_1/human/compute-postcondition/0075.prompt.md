Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(q):
    l, r = map(int, input().split(' '))
    if l == r:
        print('NO')
        continue
    onesInRange = ones[r] - ones[l - 1]
    sumInRange = sum[r] - sum[l - 1]
    if 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange <= sumInRange:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer, r is an integer, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, _ is 0. If 2 times the number of 1's in the range from l-1 to r-1 plus the length of the range minus the number of 1's in the range is less than or equal to the sum of the numbers in the range from l-1 to r-1, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 1, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-5 test cases, _ is 1. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 2, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-8 test cases, _ is 2. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 1, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-8 test cases, _ is 1. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer equal to the fifth integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the sixth integer from the input, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-11 test cases, _ is 2. If 2 * onesInRange + (r - l + 1) - onesInRange is less than or equal to sumInRange, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
