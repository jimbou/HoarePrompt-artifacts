Output State: **stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer, q is an integer, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 zeros, sum is a list of n+1 zeros**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the state of the program is as follows: the standard input (stdin) now contains t-1 test cases, as one test case has been processed. The variables n and q have been assigned integer values, which were provided as input. The list nums now contains n integers, which were also provided as input. Two new lists, ones and sum, have been created, each containing n+1 zeros. The values of n, q, and nums are specific integers, but their exact values are not specified as they depend on the input provided.
