To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(q):`. The only object in the loop head is `_`, which is an iteration variable, and `q`, which is the range.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `q`. If `q` is greater than 1, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `q` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be decremented by 1, since the range function generates numbers from 0 to `q-1`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is equal to the sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the third integer from the input, `r` is an integer equal to the fourth integer from the input, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index `l-1` to `r-1`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to the sum of `nums` from index `l-1` to `r-1`, `stdin` contains `t-9` test cases, `_` is 2.**
