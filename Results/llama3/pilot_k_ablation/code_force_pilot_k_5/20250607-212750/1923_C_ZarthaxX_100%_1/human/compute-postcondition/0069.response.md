Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, q is an integer greater than 0, nums is a list of n integers, ones is a list of n+1 integers where ones[i] is equal to the number of 1's in nums from index 0 to i-1, sum is a list of n+1 integers where sum[i] is equal to the sum of nums from index 0 to i-1, i is equal to n, l is an integer equal to the fifth integer from the input, r is an integer equal to the sixth integer from the input, onesInRange is an integer equal to the number of 1's in nums from index l-1 to r-1, sumInRange is an integer equal to the sum of nums from index l-1 to r-1, stdin contains t-11 test cases, _ is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `onesInRange` and `sumInRange` have been updated based on the values of `ones`, `sum`, `l`, and `r`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
