Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `q` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list of `n` integers, `ones` is a list of `n+1` integers where `ones[i]` is equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `sum` is a list of `n+1` integers where `sum[i]` is equal to the sum of `nums` from index 0 to `i-1`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `r` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `onesInRange` is an integer equal to the number of 1's in `nums` from index `l-1` to `r-1`, `sumInRange` is an integer equal to the sum of `nums` from index `l-1` to `r-1`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, `_` is 1, 'NO' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. No variables have changed values, and the program continues to the next iteration.
