Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of four pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the corners of a square. It calculates the square of the distance between the first pair of coordinates and the second pair, and the square of the distance between the first pair and the third pair. It then prints the smaller of these two squared distances for each test case.**
