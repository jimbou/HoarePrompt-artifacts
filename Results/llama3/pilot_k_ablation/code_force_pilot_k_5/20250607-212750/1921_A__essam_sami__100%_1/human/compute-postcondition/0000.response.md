Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of the square.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 100. The stdin still contains t testcases, each with four lines of two integers representing the coordinates of the corners of the square. The values of the other variables are not affected.
