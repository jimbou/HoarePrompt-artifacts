Postcondition: ***t is an integer greater than 3, steps is 4, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty. If x is greater than n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x is printed.***
