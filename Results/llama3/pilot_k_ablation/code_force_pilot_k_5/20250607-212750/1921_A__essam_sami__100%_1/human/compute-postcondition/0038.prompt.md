Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t testcases. Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers x_i, y_i (-1000 <= x_i, y_i <= 1000), coordinates of the corners of the square.
Code of the loop:
for steps in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c, d = map(int, input().split())
    e, f = map(int, input().split())
    g, h = map(int, input().split())
    n = (a - c) * (a - c) + (b - d) * (b - d)
    x = (a - e) * (a - e) + (b - f) * (b - f)
    if x > n:
        print(n)
    else:
        print(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer greater than 0, steps is 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty. If the current value of x is greater than the current value of n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer greater than 0, steps is 1, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty. If x is greater than n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer greater than 1, steps is 2, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty. If x is greater than n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is an integer greater than 2, steps is 3, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty. If x is greater than n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is an integer greater than 3, steps is 4, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty. If x is greater than n, the value of n is printed. Otherwise, the value of x is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
