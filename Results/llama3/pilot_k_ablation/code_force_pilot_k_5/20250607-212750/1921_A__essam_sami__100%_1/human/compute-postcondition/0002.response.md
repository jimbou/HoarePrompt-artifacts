The code snippet reads four pairs of integers from stdin and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`, `g`, and `h`. It then calculates the values of `n` and `x` based on these variables.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, steps is 0, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty**
