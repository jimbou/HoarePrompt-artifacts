Output State: **t is an integer greater than 3, steps is 4, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h are integers, n is the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d, x is the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f, stdin is empty.**

The code first reads four pairs of integers from stdin, assigning them to a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h. Then, it calculates the value of n as the square of the difference between a and c plus the square of the difference between b and d. Similarly, it calculates the value of x as the square of the difference between a and e plus the square of the difference between b and f. The values of t and steps remain unchanged.
