To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `steps` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Since `t` is already an integer between 1 and 100, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0.

Additionally, since `steps` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `steps` is 0**
