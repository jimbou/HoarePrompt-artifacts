Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It initializes the start and end values to -1 and 10^9 respectively, and then iterates through each constraint. If the constraint type is 1, it updates the start value if the current value is greater than the start value. If the constraint type is 2, it updates the end value if the current value is less than the end value. If the constraint type is 3, it adds the value to the num list. After iterating through all constraints, it calculates the count of numbers that satisfy all constraints by subtracting the count of numbers in the num list that are within the start and end range from the total count of numbers in the range.

The program correctly handles the edge cases where the start value is greater than the end value, in which case it returns 0. It also correctly handles the case where there are no constraints of type 1 or type 2, in which case the start and end values remain at their initial values.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
