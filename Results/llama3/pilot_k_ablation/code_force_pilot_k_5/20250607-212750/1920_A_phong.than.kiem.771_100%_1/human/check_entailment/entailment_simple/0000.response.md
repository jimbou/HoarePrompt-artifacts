Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. The program initializes the start and end values to -1 and 10^9 respectively, and then iterates over the constraints. For each constraint, it updates the start and end values accordingly. After that, it counts the number of integers in the list 'num' that are within the range of start and end, and subtracts this count from the total number of integers in the range. If start is greater than end, it returns 0, indicating that there are no integers that satisfy all constraints.

Correctness: **True**
