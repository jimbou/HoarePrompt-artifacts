Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is equal to `v`, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer and its current value is 1, `v` is an integer and its current value is greater than `start`. stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v**

In this output state, the value of `start` has been updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains n-1 inputs, each containing two integers t and v.
