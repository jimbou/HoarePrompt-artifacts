Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers, If `t` equals 2, then if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is set to `v`. If `t` equals 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` is less than `v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is not equal to 1 or 2, no changes are made. If `t` equals 3, `num` is a list that contains `v`.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `v` are updated to the values from the input. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `t` and `v` are still valid, but now `t` and `v` have specific values from the input. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
