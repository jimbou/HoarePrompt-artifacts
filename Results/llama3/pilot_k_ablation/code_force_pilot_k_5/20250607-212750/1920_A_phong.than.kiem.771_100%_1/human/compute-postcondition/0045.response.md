Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` and `v` are integers. If `t` equals 2, then if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is set to `v`. If `t` equals 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` is less than `v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is not equal to 1 or 2, no changes are made. If `t` equals 3, `num` is a list that contains `v`.***
