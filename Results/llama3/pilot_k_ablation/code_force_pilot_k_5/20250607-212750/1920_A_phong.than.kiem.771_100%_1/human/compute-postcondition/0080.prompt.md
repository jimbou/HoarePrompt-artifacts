Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, `count_num` is 0, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in num:
    if i < start or i > end:
        continue
    else:
        count_num += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least one element, `count_num` is either 0 if `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, or 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, and stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least two elements. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop and `count_num` is 0. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, or 1 if `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end` and `count_num` was 0, and stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the third element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least three elements. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop and `count_num` is 0. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, or 1 if `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end` and `count_num` was 0. If `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, `count_num` is 2, or 2 if `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end` and `count_num` was 1, and stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the fourth element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least four elements. If `i` is outside the range defined by `start` and `end`, the loop skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the fifth element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least five elements. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the current iteration of the loop is skipped. Otherwise, `count_num` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
