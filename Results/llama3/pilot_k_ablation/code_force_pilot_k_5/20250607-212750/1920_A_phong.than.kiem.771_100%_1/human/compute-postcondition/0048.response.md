Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is `v`, `end` is either `v` or its previous value, `num` is either a list that contains `v` or its previous value, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `start` is updated to `v`, regardless of its previous value. The value of `end` remains unchanged unless `t` equals 2, in which case it is set to `v` if it was previously greater than `v`. The value of `num` remains unchanged unless `t` equals 3, in which case it is a list that contains `v`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by the code. The stdin is empty because it was used to assign values to `t` and `v`.
