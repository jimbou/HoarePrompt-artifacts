Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer with a current value of 2, `v` is an integer, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v. If `t` is 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` is less than `v`, otherwise `start` remains -1. `end` is 1000000000.***
