Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, and `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The values of `n`, `i`, `start`, and `end` remain unchanged. The variable `t` is assigned an integer value from the input, and `v` is also assigned an integer value from the input. The list `num` is updated based on the value of `t`: if `t` is 3, `num` contains one element which is the value of `v`; otherwise, `num` is an empty list. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
