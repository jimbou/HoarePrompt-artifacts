Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `v`. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is equal to `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` is updated to be equal to `v` regardless of the value of `t`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `start` and `end` when `t` is 1 or 2 are still valid, but `end` is now always equal to `v`.
