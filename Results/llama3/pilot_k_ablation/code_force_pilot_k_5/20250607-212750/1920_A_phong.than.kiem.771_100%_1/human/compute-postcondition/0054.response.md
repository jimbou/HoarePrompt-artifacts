Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains `v` and its previous value if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to include `v` as its last element, while the values of the other variables remain the same. The list `num` now contains `v` and its previous value if `t` equals 3, or its previous value if `t` does not equal 3. The other variables, including `n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `start`, and `end`, retain their previous values.
