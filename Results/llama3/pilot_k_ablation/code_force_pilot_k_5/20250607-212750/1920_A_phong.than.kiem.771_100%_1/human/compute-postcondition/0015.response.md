Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `v` is an integer, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, and `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v`. Otherwise, `num` is an empty list.***
