To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. The loop will execute if `num` has at least one element. Since `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, we need to adjust the state of `num` to ensure it has at least one element.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least one element, `count_num` is 0, stdin is empty**
