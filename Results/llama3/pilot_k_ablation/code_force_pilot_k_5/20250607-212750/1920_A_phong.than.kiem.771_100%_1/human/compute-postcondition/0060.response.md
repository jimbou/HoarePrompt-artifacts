Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least one element, `count_num` is 0, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, `start`, `end`, `num`, and `count_num` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The current value of `i` is still either less than the current value of `start` or greater than the current value of `end`.
