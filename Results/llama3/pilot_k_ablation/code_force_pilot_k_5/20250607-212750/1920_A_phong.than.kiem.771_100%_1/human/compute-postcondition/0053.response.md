Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, stdin is empty***
