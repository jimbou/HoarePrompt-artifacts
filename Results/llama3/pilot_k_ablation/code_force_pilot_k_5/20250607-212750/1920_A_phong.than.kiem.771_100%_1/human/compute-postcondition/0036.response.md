The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing three elements which are the value of `v`.**
