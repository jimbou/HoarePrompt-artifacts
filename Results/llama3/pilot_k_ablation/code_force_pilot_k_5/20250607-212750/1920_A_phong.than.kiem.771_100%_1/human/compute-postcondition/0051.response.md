Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is `v`, `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to `v`, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The condition for `start` and `num` still depends on their previous values and the values of `t` and `v`.
