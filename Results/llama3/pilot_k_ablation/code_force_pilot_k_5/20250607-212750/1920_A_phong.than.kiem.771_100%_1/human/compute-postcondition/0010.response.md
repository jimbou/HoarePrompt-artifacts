Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer with a current value of 2, `v` is an integer, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is equal to `v`, stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`, which is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, depending on its previous value. The stdin still contains n-1 inputs, each containing two integers t and v.
