Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, `end` is equal to `v`, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is an integer. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `start` are still valid, but now `end` is always equal to `v`.
