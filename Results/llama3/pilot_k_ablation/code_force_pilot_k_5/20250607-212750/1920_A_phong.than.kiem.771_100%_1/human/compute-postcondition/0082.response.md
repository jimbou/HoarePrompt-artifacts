Functionality: **This function calculates the number of integers within a specified range that are not present in a given list of numbers. It takes no parameters and returns an integer value. The function reads input from the standard input, where the first line contains an integer 'n' representing the number of subsequent lines, each containing two integers 't' and 'v'. The function then processes these inputs to determine the start and end values of the range, and a list of numbers 'num'. It counts the numbers in 'num' that fall within the range and returns the difference between the range size and the count, or 0 if the start value exceeds the end value.**
