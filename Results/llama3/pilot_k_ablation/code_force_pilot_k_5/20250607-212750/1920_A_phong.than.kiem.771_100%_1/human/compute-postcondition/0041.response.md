Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `end` is equal to `v`. If `t` equals 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` is less than `v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is not equal to 1, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to be equal to `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, and `v` remain unchanged. The condition related to `start` is still valid, meaning that if `t` equals 1, `start` will be updated to `v` if it is less than `v`, otherwise it will remain unchanged. If `t` is not equal to 1, no changes will be made to `start`.
