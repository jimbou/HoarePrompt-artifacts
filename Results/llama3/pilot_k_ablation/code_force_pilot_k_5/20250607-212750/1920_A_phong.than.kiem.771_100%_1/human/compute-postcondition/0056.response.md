Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` is set to `n-1`, where `n` is the number of iterations. The variables `t` and `v` are assigned the values from the input. The `start` variable is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `v` if `t` is 1. The `end` variable is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the value of `v` if `t` is 2. The `num` list is updated to contain the value of `v` if `t` is 3. The stdin is empty after all iterations.
