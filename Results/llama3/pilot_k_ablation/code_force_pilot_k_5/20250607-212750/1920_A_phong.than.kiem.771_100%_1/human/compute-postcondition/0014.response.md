The code `num.append(v)` adds the value of `v` to the end of the list `num`. Since `num` is initially an empty list, it will now contain one element, which is the value of `v`.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v`, `t` is 3, `v` is an integer, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, and `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.**
