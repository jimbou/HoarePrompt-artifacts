Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `start` is equal to `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` is assigned the value of `v`, which is an integer. The values of the other variables, `n`, `i`, and `t`, remain unchanged. The stdin is empty since it was used to assign values to `t` and `v`.
