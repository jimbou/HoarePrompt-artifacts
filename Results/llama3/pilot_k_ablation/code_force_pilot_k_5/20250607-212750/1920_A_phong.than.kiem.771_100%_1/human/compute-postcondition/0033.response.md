Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `v`. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.***
