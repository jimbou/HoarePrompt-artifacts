The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `t` and `v` are integers. If `t` equals 2, then if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is set to `v`. If `t` equals 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` is less than `v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is not equal to 1 or 2, no changes are made. If `t` equals 3, `num` is a list that contains `v`.**
