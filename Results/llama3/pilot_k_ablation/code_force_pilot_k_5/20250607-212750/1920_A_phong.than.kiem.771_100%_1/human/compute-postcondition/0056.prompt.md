Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers t and v
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
    if t == 1:
        if start < v:
            start = v
    if t == 2:
        if end > v:
            end = v
    if t == 3:
        num.append(v)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `v` is an integer, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, and `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v`. Otherwise, `num` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `v`. stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is an integer, `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing three elements which are the value of `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` and `v` are integers. If `t` equals 2, then if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is set to `v`. If `t` equals 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` is less than `v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is not equal to 1 or 2, no changes are made. If `t` equals 3, `num` is a list that contains `v`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, stdin is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
