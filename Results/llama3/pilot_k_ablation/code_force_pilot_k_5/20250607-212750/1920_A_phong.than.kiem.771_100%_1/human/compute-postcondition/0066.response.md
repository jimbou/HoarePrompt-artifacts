Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least two elements, `count_num` is either 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, or 1 if `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end` and `count_num` was 0, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count_num` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is within the range of `start` and `end`, `count_num` is now 1. If `i` is outside this range and `count_num` was initially 0, it is now 1. Otherwise, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.
