To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `v` is an integer, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, and `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 3, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v`. Otherwise, `num` is an empty list.**
