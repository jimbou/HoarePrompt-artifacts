Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing one or two elements which are the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing three elements which are the value of `v`. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is set to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is either equal to `v` or 1000000000. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `num` has been updated to include an additional element, which is the value of `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `start` and `end` when `t` is 1 or 2 are still valid, but the value of `num` has been updated to reflect the additional element.
