Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `t` and `v` are assigned the values from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The stdin contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of the other variables are not affected.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 3, the value of `i` remains 3, and the values of `t` and `v` are updated to the integer values from the input. The stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers. The values of `start` and `end` are not affected by this code snippet.
