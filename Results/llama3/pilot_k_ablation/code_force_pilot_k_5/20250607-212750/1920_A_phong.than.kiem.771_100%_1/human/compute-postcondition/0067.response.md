Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the second element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least two elements. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop and `count_num` is 0. Otherwise, `count_num` is 1 if `i` is greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, or 1 if `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end` and `count_num` was 0, and stdin is empty.***
