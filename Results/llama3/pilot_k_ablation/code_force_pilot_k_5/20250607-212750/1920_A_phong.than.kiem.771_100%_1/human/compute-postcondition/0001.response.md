The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer, start is -1, end is 1000000000, num is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers t and v does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `start` is -1, `end` is 1000000000, `num` is an empty list, stdin contains n inputs: each containing two integers t and v**
