Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `start` is an integer, `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, and `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is 3, otherwise `num` is an empty list, stdin contains a space-separated list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `start` is updated to be equal to `v`, which is an integer. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a space-separated list of integers.
