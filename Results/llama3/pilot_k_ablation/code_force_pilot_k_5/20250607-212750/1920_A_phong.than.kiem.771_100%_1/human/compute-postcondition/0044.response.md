Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `t` and `v` are integers, `num` is a list that contains `v`, If `t` equals 2, then if `end` is greater than `v`, `end` is set to `v`. If `t` equals 1, `start` is updated to `v` if `start` is less than `v`, otherwise `start` remains unchanged. If `t` is not equal to 1 or 2, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 3, `i` is still 3, and `t` and `v` are still integers. The list `num` now contains the value of `v`. The conditions related to `t`, `end`, `start`, and `v` remain the same as in the initial state.
