Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `v`. If `t` is 1, then `start` is an integer equal to `v`, `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.**

In this output state, the value of `start` is updated to be equal to `v`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `t` is 1, then `start` is now an integer equal to `v`, and `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. The values of `n`, `i`, `t`, `v`, and `num` are not affected by the code.
