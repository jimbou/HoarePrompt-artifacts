Output State: **The program returns the difference between the end and start values plus 1 minus the number of elements in the list 'num' that are within the range of start and end, if start is less than or equal to end, otherwise it returns 0. The start value is either 'v' if it was less than 'v' or its previous value, and the end value is either 'v' if 't' equals 2 and 'end' was greater than 'v' or its previous value. The count_num value is the number of elements in 'num' that are greater than or equal to 'start' and less than or equal to 'end' minus 1 if 'i' is less than 'start' or greater than 'end', otherwise it is the number of elements in 'num' that are greater than or equal to 'start' and less than or equal to 'end'.**
