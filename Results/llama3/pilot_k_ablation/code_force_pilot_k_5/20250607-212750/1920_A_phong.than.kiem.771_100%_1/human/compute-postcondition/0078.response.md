Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the fifth element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least five elements, `count_num` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, and the only change is that `count_num` has been incremented by 1.
