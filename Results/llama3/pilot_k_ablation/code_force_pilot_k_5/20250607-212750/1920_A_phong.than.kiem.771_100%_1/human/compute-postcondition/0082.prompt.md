You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains n+1 inputs: first an integer n, then n lines each containing two integers t and v, where 1 <= t <= 3 and 1 <= v <= 10^9.
    n = int(input())
    start = -1
    end = int(1000000000.0)
    num = []
    for i in range(n):
        t, v = tuple(map(int, input().split()))
        
        if t == 1:
            if start < v:
                start = v
        
        if t == 2:
            if end > v:
                end = v
        
        if t == 3:
            num.append(v)
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, stdin is empty.
    count_num = 0
    for i in num:
        if i < start or i > end:
            continue
        else:
            count_num += 1
        
    #State: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the last element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least `n` elements. If `i` is less than `start` or greater than `end`, the loop skips to the next iteration and `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end` minus 1. Otherwise, `count_num` is the number of elements in `num` that are greater than or equal to `start` and less than or equal to `end`, and stdin is empty.
    return end - start + 1 - count_num if start <= end else 0
    #The program returns the difference between the end and start values plus 1 minus the number of elements in the list 'num' that are within the range of start and end, if start is less than or equal to end, otherwise it returns 0. The start value is either 'v' if it was less than 'v' or its previous value, and the end value is either 'v' if 't' equals 2 and 'end' was greater than 'v' or its previous value. The count_num value is the number of elements in 'num' that are greater than or equal to 'start' and less than or equal to 'end' minus 1 if 'i' is less than 'start' or greater than 'end', otherwise it is the number of elements in 'num' that are greater than or equal to 'start' and less than or equal to 'end'.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the difference between the end and start values plus 1 minus the number of elements in the list 'num' that are within the range of start and end, if start is less than or equal to end, otherwise it returns 0. The start value is either 'v' if it was less than 'v' or its previous value, and the end value is either 'v' if 't' equals 2 and 'end' was greater than 'v' or its previous value. The count_num value is the number of elements in 'num' that are greater than or equal to 'start' and less than or equal to 'end' minus 1 if 'i' is less than 'start' or greater than 'end', otherwise it is the number of elements in 'num' that are greater than or equal to 'start' and less than or equal to 'end'.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
