The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `num`. If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the `i` is the fourth element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the fourth element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least four elements**
