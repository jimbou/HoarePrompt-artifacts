Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `num` is an empty list, `t` is an integer and its current value is 1, `v` is an integer. If `start` is less than `v`, `start` is updated to `v`. Otherwise, `start` remains -1. `end` is 1000000000. stdin contains n-1 inputs: each containing two integers t and v.***
