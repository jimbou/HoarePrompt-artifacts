Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is the fifth element in the list `num`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is a list that contains at least five elements and we skip the current iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip the current iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the loop moves on to the next iteration.
