Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `t` is an integer, `v` is an integer, `num` is a list containing one element which is the value of `v` if `t` is not 3, otherwise `num` is a list containing two elements which are the value of `v`. If `t` is 1, then if `start` is less than `v`, `start` is an integer, `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. Otherwise, `start` is either -1 or an integer greater than or equal to `v`, `end` is either 1000000000 or equal to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`. If `t` is 2, then `end` is set to `v` if `end` is greater than `v`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `i`, `num`, `start`, and `end` are the same as in the initial state. The values of `t` and `v` are updated to the integers read from the input. The conditions on `start` and `end` are also updated based on the value of `t`.
