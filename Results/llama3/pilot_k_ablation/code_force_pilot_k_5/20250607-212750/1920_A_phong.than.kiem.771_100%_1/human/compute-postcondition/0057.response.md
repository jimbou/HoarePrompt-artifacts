Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n-1`, `t` and `v` are integers that are assigned the values from the input, `start` is either `v` if `start` was less than `v` or its previous value, `end` is either `v` if `t` equals 2 and `end` was greater than `v` or its previous value, `num` is either a list that contains `v` if `t` equals 3 or its previous value, `count_num` is 0, stdin is empty.**

The code initializes a new variable `count_num` and assigns it the value 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin is still empty.
