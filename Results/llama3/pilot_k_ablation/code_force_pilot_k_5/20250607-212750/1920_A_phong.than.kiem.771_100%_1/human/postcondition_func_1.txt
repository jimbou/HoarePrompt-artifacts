This function reads a line of input from the user and processes it based on two parameters: `space` and `to_int`. If `space` is True, the input is split into substrings by spaces; otherwise, it is split into individual characters. If `to_int` is True, the resulting substrings or characters are converted to integers. The function then returns the processed list, which can contain either integers or strings/characters, depending on the values of `space` and `to_int`.
