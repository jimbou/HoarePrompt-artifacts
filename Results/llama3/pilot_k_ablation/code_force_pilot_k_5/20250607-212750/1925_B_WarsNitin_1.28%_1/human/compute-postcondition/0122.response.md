Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`, `q` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed, and `int(input())` must be greater than 3. The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. The current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`.***
