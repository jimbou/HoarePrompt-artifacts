Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` is at least 5, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 5)`. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, `ans` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 4 and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`.

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be at least the maximum of its previous value and `x` divided by 5. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for `ans` being at least 5 or `x // 4` still hold if the respective conditions are met.
