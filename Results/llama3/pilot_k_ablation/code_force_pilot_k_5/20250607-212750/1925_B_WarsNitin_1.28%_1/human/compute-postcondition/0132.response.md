To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `x` is greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `x` is greater than 4, the square root of `x` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `n`, `ans`, `q`, and `stdin`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`x` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. `q` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed, and `int(input())` must be greater than 3. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`.**
