Postcondition: ***`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 3. If `x` is divisible by 3, then `ans` is the maximum of 2, `x // 2`, 3, and `x // 3` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of 2, `x // 2`, and 3 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // 2`.***
