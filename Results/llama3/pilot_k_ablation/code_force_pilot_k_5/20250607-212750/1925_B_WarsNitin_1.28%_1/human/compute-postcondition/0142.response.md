Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`.***
