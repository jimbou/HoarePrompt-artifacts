Postcondition: ***`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // 2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is at least 2. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of 2 and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2.***
