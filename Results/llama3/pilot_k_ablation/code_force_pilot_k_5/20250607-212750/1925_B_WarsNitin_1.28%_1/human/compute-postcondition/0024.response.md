The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 4, `ans` will be at least 4. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` is at least 4, `ans` is at least 4**
