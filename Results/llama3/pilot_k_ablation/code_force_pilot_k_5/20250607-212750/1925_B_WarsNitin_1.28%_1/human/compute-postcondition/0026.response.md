Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` is at least 4, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 4`, where `x // 4` is the integer division of `x` by 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
