To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `sqrt(x)` is at least 4.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 5. Additionally, since `sqrt(x)` is at least 4, we need to ensure that `sqrt(x)` is still at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`. Otherwise, no additional conditions are imposed.**
