Postcondition: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1.**
