Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: q is 0, ans is 1, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and x - n * (x // i) % (x // i
            ) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`. If `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`. If `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` divided by the integer division of `x` by `i` is 0, then `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // 2`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is at least 2. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of 2 and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 3. If `x` is divisible by 3, then `ans` is the maximum of 2, `x // 2`, 3, and `x // 3` if `x - n * (x // i) >= 0` and `x // i > 0` and `(x - n * (x // i)) % (x // i) == 0`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of 2, `x // 2`, and 3 if `x - n * i >= 0` and `(x - n * i) % i == 0`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of 2 and `x // 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` is at least 4. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`. Otherwise, no additional conditions are imposed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 5, then if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, `ans` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 4 and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `(x // i)`, then `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 5)`. If `x` is not divisible by 5, no additional conditions are imposed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
