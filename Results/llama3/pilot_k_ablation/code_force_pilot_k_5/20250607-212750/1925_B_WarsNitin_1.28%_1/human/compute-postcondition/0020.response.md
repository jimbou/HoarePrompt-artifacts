Output State: **`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of 2, `x // 2`, 3, and `x // 3`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now the maximum of 2, `x // 2`, 3, and `x // 3`, which means it is the maximum of the original maximum and the new value `x // 3`. The other conditions and variables remain the same as in the initial state.
