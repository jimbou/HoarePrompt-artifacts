To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and `sqrt(x)`. The loop will execute if `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, since the range starts from 1. 

State: **`q` is 0, `ans` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty**
