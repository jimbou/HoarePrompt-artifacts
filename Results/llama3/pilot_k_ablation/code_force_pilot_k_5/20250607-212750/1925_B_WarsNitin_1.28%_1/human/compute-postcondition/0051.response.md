Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `i`, which is 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is still not being printed.
