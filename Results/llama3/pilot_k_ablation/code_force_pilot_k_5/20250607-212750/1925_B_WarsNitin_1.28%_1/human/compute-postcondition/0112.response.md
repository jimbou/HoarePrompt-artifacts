Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `x` remains an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` remains an integer between 1 and `x`, and `ans` is updated to be the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies the conditions `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. The value of `q` remains 2, and the standard input remains empty. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies the conditions is being printed, and `i` is not the square root of `x`. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies the conditions and is equal to `ans` is not being printed. Finally, `x` is greater than 0.
