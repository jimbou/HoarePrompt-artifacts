Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 36, `i` is greater than or equal to 6, `sqrt(x)` is at least 6. If `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // i)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables, `x`, `i`, and `sqrt(x)`, remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` being at least `i` still holds if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`.
