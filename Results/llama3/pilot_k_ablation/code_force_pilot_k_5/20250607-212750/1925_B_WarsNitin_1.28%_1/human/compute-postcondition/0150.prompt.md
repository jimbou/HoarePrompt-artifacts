Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers, the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is being printed, i is not the square root of x, the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is not being printed, x is greater than 0, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is being printed, and int(input()) must be greater than 3
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and x - n * (x // i) % (x // i
            ) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`, `q` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed, and `int(input())` must be greater than 3. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. `q` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed, and `int(input())` must be greater than 3. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. If `x` is not a multiple of `i`, then the state of `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`x` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `x // i`. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. If none of the above conditions are met, then `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`x` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and 5. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the previous `ans`, 5, and `x // i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
