Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `ans` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `i`.
2. The current value of `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`, which is 2 (since `i` is 2).
3. The maximum of `ans` (2) and `i` (2) is still 2.

The values of the other variables (`q`, `x`, `n`, and `i`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`q` is 0, `ans` is 2, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 2, `sqrt(x)` is at least 2**
