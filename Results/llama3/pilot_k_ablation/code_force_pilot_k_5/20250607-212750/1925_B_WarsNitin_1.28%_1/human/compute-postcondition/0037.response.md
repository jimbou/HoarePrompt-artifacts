The code prints the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. Where `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, and `sqrt(x)` is at least 1.
Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i)**
