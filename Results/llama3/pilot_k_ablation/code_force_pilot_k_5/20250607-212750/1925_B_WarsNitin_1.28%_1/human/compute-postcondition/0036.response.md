Output State: **`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `ans` will be the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies the conditions `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. The values of `q`, `x`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
