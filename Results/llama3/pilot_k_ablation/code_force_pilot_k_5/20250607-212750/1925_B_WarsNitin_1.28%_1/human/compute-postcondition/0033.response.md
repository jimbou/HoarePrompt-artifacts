Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` is at least 5, `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 5)`. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, `ans` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 4 and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `q` remains 0, `x` is still an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is still an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is still 5, and the square root of `x` is at least 5. The value of `ans` is now at least the maximum of 5 and `x` divided by 5. The conditions for `ans` being at least 5 when `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, and being at least `max(ans, x // 4)` when `x` is divisible by 4 and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)` still hold.
