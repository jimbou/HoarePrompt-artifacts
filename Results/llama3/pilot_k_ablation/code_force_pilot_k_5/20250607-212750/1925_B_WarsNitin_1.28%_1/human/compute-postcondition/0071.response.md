Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 5. If `x - n * 5` is non-negative and divisible by 5, `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 5)`. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // 4)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // 4)`, `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 4)`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 5)`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be at least `max(5, x // 5)`, which is the maximum of the previous minimum value of `ans` and the new value `x // 5`. The other variables remain unchanged.
