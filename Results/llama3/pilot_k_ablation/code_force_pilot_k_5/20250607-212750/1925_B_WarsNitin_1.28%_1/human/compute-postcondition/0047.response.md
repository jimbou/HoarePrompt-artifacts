Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and `x // i`, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then the current value of `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`, where `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
