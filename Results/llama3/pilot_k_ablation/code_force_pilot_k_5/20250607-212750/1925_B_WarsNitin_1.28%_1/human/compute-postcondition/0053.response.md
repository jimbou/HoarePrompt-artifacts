Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and `x // i`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for the maximum divisor `i` of `x` are still the same, and `ans` is still the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1 if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.
