Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // i)`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, i)`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then the value of `ans` remains unchanged.***
