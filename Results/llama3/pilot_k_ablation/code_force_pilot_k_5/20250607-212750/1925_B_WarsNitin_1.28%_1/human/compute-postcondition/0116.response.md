The code assigns the values of two integers from stdin to `x` and `n`, respectively. The value of `ans` is set to 1. The value of `q` remains unchanged at 3. Stdin now contains one input: a space-separated list of two integers. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed. `i` is not the square root of `x`. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed. `x` is greater than 0. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed. `int(input())` must be greater than 3.
