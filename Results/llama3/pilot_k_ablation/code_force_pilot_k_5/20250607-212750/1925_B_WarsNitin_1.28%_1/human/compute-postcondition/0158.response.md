Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0, `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`, and `ans` is at least `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be at least `i`, which is greater than or equal to 2. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
