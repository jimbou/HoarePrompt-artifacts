The code `ans = max(ans, i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 5, `ans` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 5.

Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and 5.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and 5, while the values of `x`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged.
