The code prints the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, which is `ans`. 

Since the exact value of `x` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated maximum divisor.

Output: **ans (where ans is the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i)**
