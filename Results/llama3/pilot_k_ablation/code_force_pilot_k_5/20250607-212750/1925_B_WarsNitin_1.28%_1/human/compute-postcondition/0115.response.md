The only variable in the loop head is variable  q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 2, `int(input())` is unknown. For the loop to execute again `q` must be increased by 1 so `q` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 3.
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `q` is 3, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed, and `int(input())` must be greater than 3**
