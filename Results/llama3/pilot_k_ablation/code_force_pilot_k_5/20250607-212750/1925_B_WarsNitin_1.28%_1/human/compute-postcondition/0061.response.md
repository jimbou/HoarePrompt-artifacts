Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3. If `x` is a multiple of 3, then if `x - n * (x // 3)` is greater than or equal to 0 and is a multiple of `x // 3`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`. If `x` is not a multiple of 3, no changes are made to `ans`.***
