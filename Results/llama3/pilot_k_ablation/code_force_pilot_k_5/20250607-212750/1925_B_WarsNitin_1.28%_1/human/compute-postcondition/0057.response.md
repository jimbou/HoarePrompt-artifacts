Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is either the previous value of `ans` or 3, whichever is larger.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `n`, `q`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the current value of `i`, which is 3.
