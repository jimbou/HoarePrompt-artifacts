Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3. If `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is a multiple of `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.***
