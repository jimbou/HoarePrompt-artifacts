Output State: **`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the current value of `i` (1). Since `i` is 1, `ans` remains 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
