Postcondition: ***`q` is 0, `ans` is 1, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0***
