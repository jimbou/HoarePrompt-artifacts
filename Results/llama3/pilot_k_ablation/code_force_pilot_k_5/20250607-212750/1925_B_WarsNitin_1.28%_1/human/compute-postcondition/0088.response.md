The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `sqrt(x)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 4.
State: **`x` is an integer between 5 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, `i`, and `x // i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2**
