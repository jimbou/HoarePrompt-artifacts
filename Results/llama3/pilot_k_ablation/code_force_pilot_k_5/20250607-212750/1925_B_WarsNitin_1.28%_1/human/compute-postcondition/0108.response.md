Postcondition: **`x` is an integer between 5 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, 3, `x // 3`, 3, `x // 3`, 4, `x // i`, and `i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is 4, and `ans` is updated to `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `i` is 2. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to `i`.**
