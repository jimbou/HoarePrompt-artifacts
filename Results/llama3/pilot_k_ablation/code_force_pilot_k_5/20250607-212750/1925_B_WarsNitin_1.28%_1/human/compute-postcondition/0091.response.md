Output State: **`x` is an integer between 5 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, `i`, `x // i`, and `i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then the maximum divisor `i` of `x` is being printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.**

The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. Since `i` is 2, `x // i` is equal to `x // 2`. Therefore, `ans` is now the maximum of 1, 2, `x // 2`, and 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
