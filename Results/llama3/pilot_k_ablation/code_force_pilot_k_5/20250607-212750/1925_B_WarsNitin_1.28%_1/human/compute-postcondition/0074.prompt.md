Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 1, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is not being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and x - n * (x // i) % (x // i
            ) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3. If `x` is a multiple of 3, then if `x - n * (x // 3)` is greater than or equal to 0 and is a multiple of `x // 3`, `ans` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `x // 3`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`. If `x` is not a multiple of 3, no changes are made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 4. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // 4)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // 4)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` is not divisible by 4, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 5. If `x` is divisible by 5, then if `x - n * 5` is non-negative and divisible by 5, `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 5)`. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // 4)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // 4)`, `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 4)`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 5)`. If `x` is not divisible by 5, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
