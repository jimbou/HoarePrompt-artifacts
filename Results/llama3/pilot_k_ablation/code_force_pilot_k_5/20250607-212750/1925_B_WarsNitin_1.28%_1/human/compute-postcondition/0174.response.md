Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 4, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1. If `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `(x // i)`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // i)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.***
