The `print(ans)` statement will print the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies the given conditions.

Since `ans` is defined as the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, the value of `ans` depends on the values of `x` and `n`.

However, the exact values of `x` and `n` are not provided in the precondition. Therefore, we cannot compute the exact numerical value of `ans`.

But we can describe the value of `ans` based on the given conditions. The value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor `i` of `x` that satisfies the conditions.

Output: **the maximum divisor i of x that satisfies the given conditions (where x is an integer greater than 0 and n is an integer between 1 and x)**
