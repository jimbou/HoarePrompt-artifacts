The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `sqrt(x)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `x` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to 16.
State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`**
