Output State: **`q` is `int(input()) - 1`, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is the square root of `x` plus 1, `int(input())` is greater than or equal to 0, and `ans` is printed, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable `q` will have a value equal to the number of test cases minus 1, the variable `ans` will hold the maximum divisor of `x` that satisfies the given conditions, `x` and `n` will be within their specified ranges, `i` will be the square root of `x` plus 1, the input will be consumed, and the final value of `ans` will be printed.
