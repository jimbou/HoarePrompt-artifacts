Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i, q is 1, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is not being printed, i is the square root of x.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. The value of `i` is the square root of `x`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
