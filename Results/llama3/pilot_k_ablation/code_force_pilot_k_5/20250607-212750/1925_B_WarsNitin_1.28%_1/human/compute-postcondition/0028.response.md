Postcondition: ***`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` is at least 4. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`. Otherwise, no additional conditions are imposed.***
