Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers x and n. It then finds the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i. The function prints the maximum divisor for each test case.**
