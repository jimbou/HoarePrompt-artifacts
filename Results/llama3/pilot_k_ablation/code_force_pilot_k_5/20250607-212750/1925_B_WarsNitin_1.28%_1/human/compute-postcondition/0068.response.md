The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `sqrt(x)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and for the loop to execute again `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 5.
State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 5. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // 4)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // 4)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` is not divisible by 4, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.**
