To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, and `sqrt(x)` is at least 1.

To make the loop execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes greater than or equal to 4. Additionally, `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, such as `ans`, `n`, and `x // i`, are not part of the loop head and therefore cannot be adjusted.

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 4, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1**
