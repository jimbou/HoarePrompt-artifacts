Output State: **`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` is at least 5, `ans` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be at least 5, as the maximum of `ans` and `i` (which is 5) is assigned to `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions imposed on `ans` when `x` is divisible by 4 still hold.
