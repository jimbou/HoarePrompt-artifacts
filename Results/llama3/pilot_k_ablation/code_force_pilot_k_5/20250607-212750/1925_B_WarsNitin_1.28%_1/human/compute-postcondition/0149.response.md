Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`. `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans` and 5. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is updated to be the maximum of the previous `ans`, 5, and `x // i`.***
