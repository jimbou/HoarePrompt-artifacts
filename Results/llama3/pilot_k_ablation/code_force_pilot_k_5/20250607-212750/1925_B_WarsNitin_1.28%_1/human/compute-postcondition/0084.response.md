Postcondition: **`x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` (which is 1) and the current `i` (which is 1), `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. Furthermore, the current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is positive, and the current value of `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`.**
