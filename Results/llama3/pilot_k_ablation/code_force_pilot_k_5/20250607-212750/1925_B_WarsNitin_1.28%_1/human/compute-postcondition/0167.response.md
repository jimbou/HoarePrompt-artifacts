Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // i)`, if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, i)`, if `x` is divisible by `i`, `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be at least the maximum of its previous value and `x // i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
