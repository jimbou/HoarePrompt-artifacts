Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 1, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is not being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `n` are updated to the input values, and `ans` is reset to 1. The value of `q` remains unchanged. Stdin is empty because the input values have been read. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is no longer being printed.
