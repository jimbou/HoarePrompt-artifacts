Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 2. If `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1.***
