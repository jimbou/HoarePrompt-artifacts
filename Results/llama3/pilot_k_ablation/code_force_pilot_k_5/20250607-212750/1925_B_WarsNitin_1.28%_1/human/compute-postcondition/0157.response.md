Postcondition: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, and the current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. Additionally, the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the current value of `x` minus `n` times `i` is divisible by `i`.**
