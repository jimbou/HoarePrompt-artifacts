Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is being printed, i is not the square root of x, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is not being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and x - n * (x // i) % (x // i
            ) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, `i`, and `x // i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 5 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, `i`, `x // i`, and `i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then the maximum divisor `i` of `x` is being printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 5 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, 3, `x // 3`, 3, and `x // 3`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 3. If `x` is divisible by 3 and `x - n * (x // 3)` is non-negative and `x // 3` is positive and `x - n * (x // 3)` is divisible by `x // 3`, then the maximum divisor 3 of `x` is being printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `x` is an integer between 5 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, 3, `x // 3`, 3, `x // 3`, 4, and `x // i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is 4, and `ans` is updated to `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `x` is an integer between 5 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of 1, 3, `x // 3`, 3, `x // 3`, 4, `x // i`, and `i`, `q` is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, if `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is 4, and `ans` is updated to `x // i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to `i` if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
