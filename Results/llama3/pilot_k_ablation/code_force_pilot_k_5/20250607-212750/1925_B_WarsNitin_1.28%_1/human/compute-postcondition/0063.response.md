The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`. Since `i` is 4, `ans` will be at least 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 4, and `ans` is at least 4.
Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 4, and `ans` is at least 4.**
