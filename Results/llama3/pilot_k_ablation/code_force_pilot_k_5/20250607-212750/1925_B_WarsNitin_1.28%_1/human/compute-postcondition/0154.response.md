Output State: **x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 4, stdin is empty, i is the square root of x plus 1, the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is not being printed, the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is being printed, and int(input()) is greater than 4.**

The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `n`. Since `x` is greater than 0, and `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `x` and `n` become the input values. The second line assigns the value 1 to `ans`. The value of `q` remains 4. Stdin is now empty. The value of `i` remains the square root of `x` plus 1. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed. The maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed. The value of `int(input())` is greater than 4.
