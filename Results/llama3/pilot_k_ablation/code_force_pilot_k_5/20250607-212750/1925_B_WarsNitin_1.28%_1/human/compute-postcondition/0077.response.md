The only objects in the loop head are variables  q and input, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input.  If the input is at least 2 the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, q is 1 and input is empty. So for the loop to be executed one more time the input must not be empty and the q is 2.
State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i, q is 2, stdin is not empty, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is not being printed, i is the square root of x, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is being printed**
