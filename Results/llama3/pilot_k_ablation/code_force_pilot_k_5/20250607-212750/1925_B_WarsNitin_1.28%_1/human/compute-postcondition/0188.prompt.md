Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 4, stdin is empty, i is the square root of x plus 1, the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is not being printed, the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is being printed, and int(input()) is greater than 4.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):
    if x % i == 0:
        if x - n * i >= 0 and (x - n * i) % i == 0:
            ans = max(ans, i)
        if x - n * (x // i) >= 0 and x // i > 0 and x - n * (x // i) % (x // i
            ) == 0:
            ans = max(ans, x // i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // i)`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * i` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, i)`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 4, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to be at least `max(ans, x // i)` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0 and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `(x // i)`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 5, `sqrt(x)` is at least 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // i, i)` if `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0 and `(x - n * (x // i))` is divisible by `(x // i)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 36, `i` is greater than or equal to 6, `sqrt(x)` is at least 6. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // i)`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
