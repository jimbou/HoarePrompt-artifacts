Output: **`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed**
