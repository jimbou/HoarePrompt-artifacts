Output State: **`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of the maximum of 1 and `i` and the integer division of `x` by `i`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 1, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` minus `n` times `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times `i` divided by `i` is 0, then `ans` is the maximum of 1 and `i`. The current value of `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the integer division of `x` by `i` is greater than 0, and the remainder of `x` minus `n` times the integer division of `x` by `i` divided by the integer division of `x` by `i` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (which was the maximum of 1 and `i`) and the integer division of `x` by `i`. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
