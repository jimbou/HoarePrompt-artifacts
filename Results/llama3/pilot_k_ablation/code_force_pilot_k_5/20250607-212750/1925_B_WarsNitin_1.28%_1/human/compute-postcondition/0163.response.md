Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least `x // i`.***
