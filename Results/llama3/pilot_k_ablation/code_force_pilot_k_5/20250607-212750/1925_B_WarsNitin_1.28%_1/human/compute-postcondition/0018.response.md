Output State: **`q` is 0, `ans` is the maximum of 2, `x // 2`, and 3, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (the maximum of 2 and `x // 2`) and the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
