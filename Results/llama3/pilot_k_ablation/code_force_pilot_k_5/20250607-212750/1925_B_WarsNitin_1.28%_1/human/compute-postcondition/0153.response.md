The only variable in the loop head is variable q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable q and the input from stdin. If q is less than the input from stdin, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, q is 3 and the input from stdin is greater than 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time q must be 4.
State: **`x` is greater than 0, `i` is the square root of `x` plus 1, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `q` is 4, stdin contains 1 input: a space-separated list of two integers, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, `i` is not the square root of `x`, the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is not being printed, `x` is greater than 0, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` which is `ans` is being printed, and `int(input())` must be greater than 4, and ans is printed**
