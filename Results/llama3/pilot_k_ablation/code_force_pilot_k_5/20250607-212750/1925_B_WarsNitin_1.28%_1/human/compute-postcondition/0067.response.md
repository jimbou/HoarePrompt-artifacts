Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 4. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // 4)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // 4)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` remains unchanged. If `x` is not divisible by 4, the state of `ans` remains unchanged.***
