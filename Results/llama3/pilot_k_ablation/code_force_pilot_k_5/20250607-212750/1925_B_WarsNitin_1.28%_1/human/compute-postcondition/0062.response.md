The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `sqrt(x)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 4.
State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 4**
