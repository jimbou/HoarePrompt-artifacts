Postcondition: ***`q` is 0, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` is at least 5. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, `ans` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 4 and `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // i)`, `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`.***
