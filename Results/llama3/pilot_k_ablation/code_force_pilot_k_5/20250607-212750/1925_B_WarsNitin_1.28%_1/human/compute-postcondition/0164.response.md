To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how the variables involved in it change. The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(sqrt(x)) + 1):`.

1. **`i`**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 because that's how `range` works in Python. So, `i` should be greater than or equal to 3.

2. **`x`**: The state of `x` does not directly depend on the loop head. It's influenced by operations within the loop body, which we're not considering here. So, `x` remains an integer greater than 0.

3. **`sqrt(x)`**: Since `x` doesn't change due to the loop head, `sqrt(x)` remains at least 1.

4. **`ans`**: The state of `ans` is determined by conditions within the loop body and is not directly affected by the loop head. Therefore, its state remains as it was, which is at least `x // i` under certain conditions.

5. **`n`**: There's no mention of `n` in the loop head, so we cannot adjust its state based on the loop head alone. However, since `n` is mentioned in the conditions affecting `ans`, it's worth noting that its state isn't directly modified by the loop head.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`x` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is greater than or equal to 3, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, and `x - n * (x // i)` is greater than or equal to 0, `x // i` is greater than 0, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, then `ans` is at least `x // i`.**
