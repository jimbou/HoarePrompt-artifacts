Output State: **`x` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the previous `ans`, 5, and `x // i`**.

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value, 5, and the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`. The other variables, `x`, `i`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
