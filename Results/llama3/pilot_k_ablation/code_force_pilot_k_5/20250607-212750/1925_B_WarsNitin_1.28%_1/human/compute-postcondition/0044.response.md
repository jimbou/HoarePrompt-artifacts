Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current value of `i` and 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is a divisor of `x`. Additionally, the current value of `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (1) and the current value of `i`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still a divisor of `x`, and the value of `x - n * i` is still non-negative and divisible by `i`.
