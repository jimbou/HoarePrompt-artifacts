The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3.
State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 3**
