Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 36, `i` is greater than or equal to 6, `sqrt(x)` is at least 6, `ans` is at least `i`**

The code assigns the maximum value between `ans` and `i` to `ans`. Since `i` is greater than or equal to 6, `ans` will be at least `i`, which means `ans` will be greater than or equal to 6. The values of `x` and `sqrt(x)` remain unchanged, so `x` is still an integer greater than or equal to 36, and `sqrt(x)` is at least 6.
