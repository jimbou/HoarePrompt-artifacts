The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(sqrt(x)) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 5, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `sqrt(x)` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to `i` squared. So `i` is greater than or equal to 6 and `x` is greater than or equal to 36.
State: **`x` is an integer greater than or equal to 36, `i` is greater than or equal to 6, `sqrt(x)` is at least 6**
