Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 4, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 4. If `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is at least `max(ans, x // 4)`.**

The code updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`, where `i` is 4. Since `x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, and `i` is 4, `x // i` will be an integer between 0 and 2.5 * 10^7. The value of `ans` will be at least `x // 4` if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
