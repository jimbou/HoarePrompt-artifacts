Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, ans is 1, q is 2, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is being printed, i is not the square root of x, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is not being printed.**

The code reads two integers from stdin, assigning them to x and n. The value of ans is set to 1. The value of q remains unchanged at 2. Stdin is now empty after reading the two integers. The maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i is being printed, but its value is not updated. The value of i is no longer the square root of x, and the maximum divisor i of x such that x - n * i is non-negative and divisible by i, or x - n * (x // i) is non-negative, x // i is positive, and x - n * (x // i) is divisible by x // i which is ans is not being printed.
