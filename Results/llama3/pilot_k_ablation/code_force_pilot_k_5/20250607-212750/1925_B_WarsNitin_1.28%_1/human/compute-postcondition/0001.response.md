The first line reads an integer t from stdin, which is between 1 and 10^3. This value is not assigned to any variable, so it does not affect the state directly. However, it determines the number of lines that will be read in the following loop.

The loop then reads t lines from stdin, each containing two integers x and n. The values of x and n are assigned to the variables x and n, respectively, on each iteration. The range of x is between 1 and 10^8, and the range of n is between 1 and x.

The variable q is initialized to 0 and remains unchanged throughout the code.

The variable ans is initialized to 1 and also remains unchanged throughout the code.

Since the code does not modify the values of q and ans, their final values are the same as their initial values.

The final state of the variables after the code execution is:

Output State: **q is 0, ans is 1, x is an integer between 1 and 10^8, n is an integer between 1 and x, stdin is empty**
