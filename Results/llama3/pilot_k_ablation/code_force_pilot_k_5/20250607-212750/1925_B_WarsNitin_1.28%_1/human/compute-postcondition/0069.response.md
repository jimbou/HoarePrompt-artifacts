Output State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `q` is 1, `i` is 5, `sqrt(x)` must be greater than 5, `ans` is at least 5. If `x` is divisible by 4, then if `x - n * (x // 4)` is non-negative and divisible by `(x // 4)`, `ans` is at least `max(5, x // 4)`. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is at least 5.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be at least 5, as the `max` function has been used to compare the current value of `ans` with the value of `i`, which is 5. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to `x` being divisible by 4 and the value of `ans` being updated accordingly still hold.
