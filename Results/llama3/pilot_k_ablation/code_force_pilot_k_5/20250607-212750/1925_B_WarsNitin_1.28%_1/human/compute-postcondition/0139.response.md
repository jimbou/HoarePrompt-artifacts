Output State: **`x` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `ans` is the maximum of the current `ans` and `i` if `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. Additionally, if `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of the current `ans` and `i`. If `x` is not a multiple of `i`, then the state of `ans` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i`, which is 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for updating `ans` are still valid, but the value of `ans` is now at least 4.
