To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to the square root of `x`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be greater than 1.

State: **`x` is an integer between 2 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and x, `ans` is 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is not being printed, `i` is 1**
