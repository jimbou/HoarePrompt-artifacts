The only variable in the loop head is variable  q, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q`. If `q` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 0, `int(input())` is unknown. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be increased by 1, so `q` is 1, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`q` is 1, `ans` is the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i`, `x` is an integer between 1 and 10^8, `n` is an integer between 1 and `x`, `i` is `sqrt(x)`, `sqrt(x)` is at least 1, stdin is empty, and the maximum divisor `i` of `x` such that `x - n * i` is non-negative and divisible by `i`, or `x - n * (x // i)` is non-negative, `x // i` is positive, and `x - n * (x // i)` is divisible by `x // i` is being printed, and `int(input())` must be greater than 1**
