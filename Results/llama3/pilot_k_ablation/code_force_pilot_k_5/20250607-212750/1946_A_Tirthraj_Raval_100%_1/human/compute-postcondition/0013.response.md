The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `t` is a positive integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `p` is an integer, `res` is the count of the most frequent integer in the second half of `a`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2, and the count of the most frequent integer in the second half of `a` is printed**
