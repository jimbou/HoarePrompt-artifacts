Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n is an integer, a is a sorted list of integers, p is an integer, res is the count of the most frequent integer in the second half of a, stdin contains multiple test cases - 2**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `_` also remains the same. The value of `n` is updated to the integer value of the input. The list `a` is updated to a sorted list of integers from the input. The value of `p` is calculated as the index of the middle element of the second half of `a`. The value of `res` is updated to the count of the most frequent integer in the second half of `a`, which is the count of the integer at index `p`. The stdin now contains multiple test cases - 2, as two inputs have been read.
