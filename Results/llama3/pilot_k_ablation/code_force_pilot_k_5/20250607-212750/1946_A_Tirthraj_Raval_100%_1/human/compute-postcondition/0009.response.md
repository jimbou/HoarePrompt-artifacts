To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1 and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. To execute the loop again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but since `_` is now 2, `t` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `p` is an integer, `res` is the count of the most frequent integer in the second half of `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases - 2, and the count of the most frequent integer in the second half of `a` is printed**
