Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard after k moves. The dynamic programming approach used in the program is correct, and the base cases are properly handled.

The program first initializes a dynamic programming array dp of size 300007, where dp[i] represents the number of possible final configurations for an i x i chessboard. The function func_1 calculates the values of dp[i] for i from 1 to 300000.

The main part of the program reads the input, which consists of the number of test cases t, and for each test case, the size of the chessboard n and the number of moves k. It then reads the k moves and stores the rows and columns of the moves in a set invalid.

The program then prints the value of dp[n - len(invalid)], which represents the number of possible final configurations for the remaining valid positions on the chessboard.

The program correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move, and it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the remaining valid positions on the chessboard.

The program also correctly handles the case where the player's move is on the diagonal, and it correctly calculates the number of possible final configurations for the remaining valid positions on the chessboard.

The program uses the modulo operator to avoid overflow, and it correctly calculates the result modulo 10^9+7.

Overall, the program is correct and it correctly solves the problem.
