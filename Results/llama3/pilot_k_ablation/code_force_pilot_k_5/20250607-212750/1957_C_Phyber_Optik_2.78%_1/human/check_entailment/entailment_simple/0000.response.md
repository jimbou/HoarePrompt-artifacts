Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of possible final configurations for a given board size `n`. The dynamic programming approach is based on the fact that the number of possible configurations for a board of size `n` can be calculated using the number of possible configurations for boards of size `n-1` and `n-2`.

The base cases are `dp[1] = 1` and `dp[2] = 3`, which are correct because there is only one way to place a rook on a 1x1 board and three ways to place a rook on a 2x2 board.

The recurrence relation `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007` is also correct. It calculates the number of possible configurations for a board of size `i` by considering two cases:

1. The rook is placed in the first row or column. In this case, the number of possible configurations is the same as the number of possible configurations for a board of size `i-1`, which is `dp[i-1]`.
2. The rook is placed in a position that is not in the first row or column. In this case, the number of possible configurations is twice the number of possible configurations for a board of size `i-2`, multiplied by the number of ways to choose the position of the rook, which is `2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]`.

The program also correctly handles the case where the computer cannot mirror the player's move by skipping the computer's turn.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
