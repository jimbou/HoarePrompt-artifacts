Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to calculate the number of possible final configurations of the chessboard. The function `func_1(n)` initializes the base cases for the dynamic programming and then iteratively calculates the subsequent terms up to the nth term. The main part of the program reads the input, calculates the number of invalid positions, and then prints the result using the precomputed dynamic programming table.

The program correctly handles the modulo operation to avoid overflow and ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 10^9+7.

Correctness: **True**
