Reasoning: The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly calculates the number of different final configurations possible when continuing the game after k moves, taking into account the valid moves and the computer's mirroring moves. The dynamic programming approach used in the program is also correct, as it calculates the nth term of the sequence based on the two preceding terms and returns the result modulo 1000000007.

Correctness: **True**
