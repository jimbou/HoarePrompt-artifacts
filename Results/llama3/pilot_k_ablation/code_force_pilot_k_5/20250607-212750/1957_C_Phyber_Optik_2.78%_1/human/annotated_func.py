#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
    dp[1] = 1
    dp[2] = 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007
        
    #State: `n` is at least 8, `i` is `n`, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29, `dp[5]` is 83, `dp[6]` is 197, `dp[7]` is 1193, `dp[i]` is ((dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the nth term of a sequence, where each term is computed based on the two preceding terms, and returns the result modulo 1000000007. The function initializes the first two terms of the sequence (dp[1] and dp[2]) and then iteratively calculates the subsequent terms up to the nth term. The final state of the program is that the nth term of the sequence is stored in dp[n].
