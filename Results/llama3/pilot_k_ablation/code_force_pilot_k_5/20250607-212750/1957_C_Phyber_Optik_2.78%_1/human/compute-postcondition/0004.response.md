The code calculates the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Since `i` is 4, we can substitute the values of `dp[3]` and `dp[2]` into the equation.

`dp[4]` is assigned the value `(dp[3] + 2 * (4 - 1) * dp[2]) % 1000000007`. Since `dp[3]` is 11 and `dp[2]` is 3, we can calculate the value of `dp[4]` as follows:

`dp[4]` = `(11 + 2 * 3 * 3) % 1000000007`
`dp[4]` = `(11 + 18) % 1000000007`
`dp[4]` = `29 % 1000000007`
`dp[4]` = `29`

Therefore, the value of `dp[4]` is 29.

The values of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29**
