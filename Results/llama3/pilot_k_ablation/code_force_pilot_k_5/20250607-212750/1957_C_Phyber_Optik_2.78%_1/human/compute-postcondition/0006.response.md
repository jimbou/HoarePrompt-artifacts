Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29, `dp[5]` is 83**.

In this output state, the value of `dp[5]` is calculated using the given formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Since `i` is 5, `dp[5]` is calculated as `(dp[4] + 2 * (5 - 1) * dp[3]) % 1000000007`, which equals `(29 + 2 * 4 * 11) % 1000000007`, resulting in 83. The values of `n`, `i`, `dp[1]`, `dp[2]`, `dp[3]`, and `dp[4]` remain unchanged.
