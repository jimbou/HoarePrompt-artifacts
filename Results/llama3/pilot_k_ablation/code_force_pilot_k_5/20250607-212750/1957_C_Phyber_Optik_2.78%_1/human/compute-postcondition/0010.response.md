The code updates the value of `dp[i]` using the values of `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]`. Since `i` is 7, we need to use the values of `dp[6]` and `dp[5]` to calculate `dp[7]`.

`dp[6]` is 197 and `dp[5]` is 83. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

`dp[7] = (dp[6] + 2 * (7 - 1) * dp[5]) % 1000000007`
`dp[7] = (197 + 2 * 6 * 83) % 1000000007`
`dp[7] = (197 + 996) % 1000000007`
`dp[7] = 1193 % 1000000007`
`dp[7] = 1193`

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `i` is 7, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29, `dp[5]` is 83, `dp[6]` is 197, `dp[7]` is 1193**
