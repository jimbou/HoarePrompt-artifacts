To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3. Since `i` is initialized to 3 in the `range` function, we can adjust the state of `i` to be 3.

The state of `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 3, so that the loop can execute.

The states of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are not relevant to the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3**
