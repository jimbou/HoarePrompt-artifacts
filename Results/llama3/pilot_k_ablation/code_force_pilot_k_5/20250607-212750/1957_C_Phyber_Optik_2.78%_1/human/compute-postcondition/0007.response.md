The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 6, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 6.
State: **`n` is at least 7, `i` is 6, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29, `dp[5]` is 83**
