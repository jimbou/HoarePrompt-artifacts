The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 6, `n` is at least 7. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 7, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 7.

State: **`n` is at least 8, `i` is 7, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29, `dp[5]` is 83, `dp[6]` is 197**
