Functionality: **This function calculates the nth term of a sequence, where each term is computed based on the two preceding terms, and returns the result modulo 1000000007. The function initializes the first two terms of the sequence (dp[1] and dp[2]) and then iteratively calculates the subsequent terms up to the nth term. The final state of the program is that the nth term of the sequence is stored in dp[n].**
