Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `i` is `n`, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29, `dp[5]` is 83, `dp[6]` is 197, `dp[7]` is 1193, `dp[i]` is ((dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007)**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` is at least 8, `i` is equal to `n`, and the values of `dp[1]` to `dp[7]` remain unchanged. The value of `dp[i]` is calculated using the formula `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`, where `i` is equal to `n`.
