Output State: **`n` is at least 7, `i` is 6, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29, `dp[5]` is 83, `dp[6]` is 197**.

In this output state, the value of `dp[6]` is calculated using the given formula: `dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Since `i` is 6, `dp[6]` is calculated as `(dp[5] + 2 * (6 - 1) * dp[4]) % 1000000007`, which is `(83 + 2 * 5 * 29) % 1000000007`, resulting in 197. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
