Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11**

In this output state, the value of `dp[3]` has been calculated using the given formula, which is `(dp[i - 1] + 2 * (i - 1) * dp[i - 2]) % 1000000007`. Substituting the values of `i`, `dp[1]`, and `dp[2]`, we get `(3 + 2 * 2 * 1) % 1000000007 = 11`. The values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, and the values of `dp[1]` and `dp[2]` are still 1 and 3, respectively.
