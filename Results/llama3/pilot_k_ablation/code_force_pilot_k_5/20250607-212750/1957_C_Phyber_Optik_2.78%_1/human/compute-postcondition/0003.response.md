According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11**
