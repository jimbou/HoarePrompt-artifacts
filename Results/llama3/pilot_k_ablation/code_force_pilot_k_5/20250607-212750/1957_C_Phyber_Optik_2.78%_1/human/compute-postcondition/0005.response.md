According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than or equal to `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and `n` must be at least 5.

State: **`n` is at least 5, `i` is 5, `dp[1]` is 1, `dp[2]` is 3, `dp[3]` is 11, `dp[4]` is 29**
