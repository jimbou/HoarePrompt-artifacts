To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 3, and `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4. Additionally, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 4**
