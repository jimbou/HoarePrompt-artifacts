To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`.

Since `t` is a positive integer and the loop iterates over a range of `t`, for the loop to execute at least once, `t` must be greater than 0. 

At the start of the loop, `T` is the first value in the range of `t`, which is 0.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and one test case has been read from stdin.**
