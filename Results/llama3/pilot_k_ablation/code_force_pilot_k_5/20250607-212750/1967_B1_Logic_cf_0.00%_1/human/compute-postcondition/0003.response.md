To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 1.

Since `n` and `m` are already positive integers, we can conclude that `min(n, m)` is at least 1. Therefore, the loop will execute.

However, to make the loop execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `b` to be 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is 0, `b` is 1**
