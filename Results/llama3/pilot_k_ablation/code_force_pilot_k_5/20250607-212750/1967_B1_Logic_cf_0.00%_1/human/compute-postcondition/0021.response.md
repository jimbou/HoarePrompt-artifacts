Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, which is the original value of `ans` (`n + 1`) plus the integer division of `n` by `b` (which is 2) plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
