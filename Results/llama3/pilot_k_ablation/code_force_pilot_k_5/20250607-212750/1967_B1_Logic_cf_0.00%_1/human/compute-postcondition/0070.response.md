Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 3, `b` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `n // 3 + 1`, which is calculated by dividing `n` by `b` (which is 3) and adding 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `min(n, m)` and `b` are still valid.
