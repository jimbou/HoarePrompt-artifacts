Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 2**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2 + 1` to its previous value, where `n` is a positive integer and `b` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` is also unchanged, as it still contains multiple test cases.
