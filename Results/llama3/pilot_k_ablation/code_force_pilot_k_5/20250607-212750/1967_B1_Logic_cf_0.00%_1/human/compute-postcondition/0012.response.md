Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 5 + 1`, `b` is 5, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 5**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // 5 + 1` to its previous value, which was `ans + n // 4 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still 5, and the condition `min(n, m)` must be greater than 5 still holds. The input state remains the same, with multiple test cases in `stdin`.
