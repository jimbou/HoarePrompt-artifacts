To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is a positive integer greater than 1
* `T` is 1
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one
* `n` is an integer
* `m` is an integer
* `ans` is `n + 1`
* `b` is 1
* `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 1

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

* `b` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `b` should be 2.
* The loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. Since `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1`, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 2**
