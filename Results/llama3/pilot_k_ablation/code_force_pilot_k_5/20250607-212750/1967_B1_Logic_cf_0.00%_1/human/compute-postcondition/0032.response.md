To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `T` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is 1 and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. To execute the loop again, `T` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is the sum of `n` divided by all integers from 1 to min(`n`, `m`) plus min(`n`, `m`), `b` is min(`n`, `m`), min(`n`, `m`) must be greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of `n` divided by all integers from 1 to min(`n`, `m`) plus min(`n`, `m`) is being printed**
