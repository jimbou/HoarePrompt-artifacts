Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is the sum of n divided by all integers from 1 to min(n, m) plus min(n, m), b is min(n, m), min(n, m) must be greater than or equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `ans` is the sum of `n` divided by all integers from 1 to the minimum of `n` and `m`, plus the minimum of `n` and `m`. The value of `b` is the minimum of `n` and `m`. The values of `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged. The minimum of `n` and `m` must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
