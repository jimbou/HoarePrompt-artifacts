Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 2**

The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `n // 2 + 1` to its previous value, which was `ans + n + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The state of the input stream (stdin) is also unchanged, as no input operation is performed. The condition `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 2 is still valid, as the values of `n` and `m` are not modified.
