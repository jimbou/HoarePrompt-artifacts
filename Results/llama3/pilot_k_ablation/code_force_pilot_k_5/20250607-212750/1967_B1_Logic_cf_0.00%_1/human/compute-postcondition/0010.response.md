Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 4 + 1`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // 4 + 1` to its previous value, where `n` is a positive integer and `b` is 4. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions `min(n, m)` must be greater than 4 and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0 are still valid.
