Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // 3 + 1` to its previous value, which was `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
