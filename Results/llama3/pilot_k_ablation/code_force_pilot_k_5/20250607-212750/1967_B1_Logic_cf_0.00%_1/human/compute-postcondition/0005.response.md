To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `m` is a positive integer.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 2. The values of `n` and `m` do not change.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 1 + 1`, `b` is 2**

Note that the values of `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head. Only the value of `b` is adjusted to reflect the next iteration of the loop.
