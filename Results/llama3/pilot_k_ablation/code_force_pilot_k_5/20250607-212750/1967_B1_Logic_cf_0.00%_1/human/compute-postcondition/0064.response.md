Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 0, b is min(n, m), min(n, m) is greater than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer greater than 1. The value of `T` also remains the same, which is 4. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one due to the execution of the code, so it now contains multiple test cases minus four.

The values of `n` and `m` have been updated to integers based on the input provided. The value of `ans` has been reset to 0, and the value of `b` remains the same as the minimum of `n` and `m`, which is greater than or equal to 1.
