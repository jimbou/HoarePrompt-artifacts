Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `ans + n // 3 + 1`, where `n` is an integer and `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now dependent on the value of `n`, which is an integer. The minimum value of `n` and `m` is still greater than or equal to 3.
