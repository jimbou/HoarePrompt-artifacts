To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. The loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is at least 1, which is already given. However, we need to adjust the state of `b` to reflect its initial value in the loop.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `b` is 1, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1**
