Output State: `t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + ... + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 1.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `ans` has been updated to include the sum of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `min(n, m)`, plus 1 for each division. The value of `b` has reached `min(n, m)`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all possible values of `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
