To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head contains the variable `b`, and the loop condition depends on `min(n, m)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 4, and `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, and `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + n // 4 + 1`, `b` is 5, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 5**
