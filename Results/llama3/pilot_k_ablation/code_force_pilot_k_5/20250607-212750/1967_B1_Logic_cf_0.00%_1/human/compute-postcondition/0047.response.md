To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `T` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `T` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is 2 and `t` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `T` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 3, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is the sum of `n // i + 1` for `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of `n // i + 1` for `i` from 1 to `min(n, m)` which is `ans` is being printed**
