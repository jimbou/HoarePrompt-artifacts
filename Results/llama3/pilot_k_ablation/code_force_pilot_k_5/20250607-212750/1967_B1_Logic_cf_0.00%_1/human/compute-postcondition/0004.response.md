Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 1 + 1`, `b` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `ans + n // 1 + 1`, which is equivalent to `ans + n + 1` since `b` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
