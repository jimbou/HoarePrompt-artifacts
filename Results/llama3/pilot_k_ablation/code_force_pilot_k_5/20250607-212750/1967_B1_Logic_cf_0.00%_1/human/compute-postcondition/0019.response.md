The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to it. Since `ans` was initially 0, its new value is `n // b + 1`. The value of `n` is an integer and the value of `b` is 1, so `n // b` is equal to `n`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1`, `b` is 1, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 1**
