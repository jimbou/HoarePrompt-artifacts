Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two positive integers n and m. It calculates the sum of n divided by all integers from 1 to the minimum of n and m, plus the minimum of n and m, and prints this sum for each test case. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
