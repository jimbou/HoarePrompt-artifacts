Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + n // 4 + 1 + n // 5 + 1`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 5, `b` is 5**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `n // 5 + 1`, which is added to the previous value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now a more complex expression involving the integer division of `n` by 5, in addition to the previous terms.
