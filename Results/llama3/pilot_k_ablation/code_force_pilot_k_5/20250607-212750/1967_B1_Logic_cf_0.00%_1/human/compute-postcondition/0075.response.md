Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is the sum of n divided by all integers from 1 to min(n, m) plus min(n, m), min(n, m) is greater than or equal to 1, b is min(n, m)**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the variable `ans` will hold the sum of `n` divided by all integers from 1 to `min(n, m)`, plus `min(n, m)`. The value of `b` will be equal to `min(n, m)`, which is the last value it took in the loop. The other variables `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged.
