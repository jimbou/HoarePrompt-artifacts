The only objects in the loop head are variables  b, n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `n` and `m`. If `b` is less than `min(n, m)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 5, and for the loop to execute again `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + n // 4 + 1`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 5, `b` is 5**
