Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + n // 4 + 1`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // 4 + 1` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now a combination of its previous value and the new addition, which includes the integer division of `n` by `b` (which is 4) plus 1. The rest of the variables and conditions in the initial state remain valid and unchanged.
