Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 3**

The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its previous value, where `b` is 3. The previous value of `ans` was `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 3 is still valid.
