Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 1 + 1`, `b` is 1, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the sum of its previous value and the result of the division of `n` by 1 plus 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The input stream still contains multiple test cases minus two. The minimum of `n` and `m` is still greater than or equal to 1.
