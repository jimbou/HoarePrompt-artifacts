To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`. The objects involved are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 3.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4. Additionally, `min(n, m)` must still be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to continue.

The other variables `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, `ans` are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 4**
