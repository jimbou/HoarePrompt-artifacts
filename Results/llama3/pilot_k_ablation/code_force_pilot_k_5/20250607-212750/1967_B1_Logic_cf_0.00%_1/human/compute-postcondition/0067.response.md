According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and the expression `min(n, m) + 1`. If `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 1, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 2, and `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 2, `b` is 2**
