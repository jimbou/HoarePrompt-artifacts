Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `T` remains 0, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases, `n` and `m` remain positive integers, `ans` has been updated to include the sum of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `min(n, m)`, plus 1, and `b` has reached the value of `min(n, m)`.
