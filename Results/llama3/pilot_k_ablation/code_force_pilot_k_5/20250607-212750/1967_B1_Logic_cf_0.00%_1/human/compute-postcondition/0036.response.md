To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 1, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 2. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 1 + 1`, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 2**
