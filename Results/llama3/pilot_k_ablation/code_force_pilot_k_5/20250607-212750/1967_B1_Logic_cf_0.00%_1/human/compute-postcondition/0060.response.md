Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + ... + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `t`, `T`, `n`, and `m` remain unchanged, `ans` is the sum of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `min(n, m)` plus 1, `b` is equal to `min(n, m)`, and `min(n, m)` is still greater than or equal to 1.
