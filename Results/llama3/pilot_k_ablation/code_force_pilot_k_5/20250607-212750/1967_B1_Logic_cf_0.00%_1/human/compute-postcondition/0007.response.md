The only variables in the loop head are variables  b, n and m, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `b`, `n` and `m`. If `b` is less than `min(n, m)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again `b` must be increased by 1 so `b` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `min(n, m)` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 3**
