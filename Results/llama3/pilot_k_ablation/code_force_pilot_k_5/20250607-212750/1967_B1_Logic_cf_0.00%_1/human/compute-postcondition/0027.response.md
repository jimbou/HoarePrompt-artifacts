Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + n // 4 + 1 + n // 5 + 1`, `b` is 5, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 5**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `n // b + 1` to its previous value, where `b` is 5. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, and `min(n, m)` are still valid.
