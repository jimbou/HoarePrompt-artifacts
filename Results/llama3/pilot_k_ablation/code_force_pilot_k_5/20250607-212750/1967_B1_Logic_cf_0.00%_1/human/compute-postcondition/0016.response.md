To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for T in range(t):`. The variables involved are `T` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `T` is 0, and `t` is a positive integer greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `T` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the new value of `T`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `T` is 1 (incremented by 1)
* `t` is a positive integer greater than 1

The other variables (`stdin`, `n`, `m`, `ans`, and `b`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // min(n, m) + 1`, `b` is `min(n, m)`**
