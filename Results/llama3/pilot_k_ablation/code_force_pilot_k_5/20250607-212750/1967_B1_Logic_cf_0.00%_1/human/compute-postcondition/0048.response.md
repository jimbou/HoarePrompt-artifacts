Output State: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is 0, b is min(n, m), min(n, m) is greater than or equal to 1**

The code first reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to n and m. The second line converts these integers to their integer values. The third line resets ans to 0. The value of t, T, and the relationship between n, m, and b remain unchanged. The value of ans is reset to 0, and the number of test cases in stdin is reduced by one.
