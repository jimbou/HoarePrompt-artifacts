Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two positive integers n and m, such that 1 <= n, m <= 2 * 10^6, and one test case has been read from stdin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The variable `t` has been assigned a positive integer value, which is the number of test cases. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and is no longer in the stdin. Each remaining test case in the stdin still contains two positive integers n and m, within the range of 1 to 2 * 10^6.
