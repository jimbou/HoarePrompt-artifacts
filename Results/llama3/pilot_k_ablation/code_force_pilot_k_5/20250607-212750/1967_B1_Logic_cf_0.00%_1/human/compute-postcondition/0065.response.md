To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `b` is the loop variable, it will start from 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is 0, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is 1**
