Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 2, `b` is 2**

The code updates the value of `ans` by adding `n // b + 1` to its previous value. Since `b` is 2, `n // b` is equivalent to `n // 2`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
