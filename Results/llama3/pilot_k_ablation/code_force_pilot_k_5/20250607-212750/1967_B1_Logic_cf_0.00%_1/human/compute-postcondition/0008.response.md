Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 3**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `ans + n // 3 + 1` because `b` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `min(n, m)` must be greater than 3 is still valid.
