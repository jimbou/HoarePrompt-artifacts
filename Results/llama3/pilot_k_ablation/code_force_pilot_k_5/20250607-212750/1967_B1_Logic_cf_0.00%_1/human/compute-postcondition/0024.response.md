To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for b in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the loop head, the loop will execute as long as `b` is less than or equal to `min(n, m)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 3.

To execute the loop again, `b` needs to be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 4. For the loop to execute again, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 4.

The other variables `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `n`, `m`, and `ans` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 4**
