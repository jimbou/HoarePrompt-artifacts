Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 2 + 1`, `b` is 2, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated by adding the result of `n` divided by `b` (which is 2) plus 1 to its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus two. The minimum of `n` and `m` is still greater than or equal to 2.
