To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 2, and `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` becomes 3. Additionally, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 3, so that the loop can execute again.

The other variables, `t`, `T`, `stdin`, `ans`, and `n` and `m` (except for the constraint on `min(n, m)`), do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 4, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1`, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 3, `b` is 3**
