Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 2, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 3 + 1 + n // 4 + 1 + n // 5 + 1`, `b` is 5, `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 5, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `n // 5 + 1`, which is the result of the new calculation `ans = ans + n // b + 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and the precondition that `min(n, m)` is greater than or equal to 5 is still valid. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus two.
