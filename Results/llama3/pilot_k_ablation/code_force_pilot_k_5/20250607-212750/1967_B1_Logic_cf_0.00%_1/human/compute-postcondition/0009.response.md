To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `b`, `n`, and `m`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `b` is less than `min(n, m) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 3, `min(n, m)` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be increased by 1, so `b` is 4, and `min(n, m)` must be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, `T` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `ans` is `ans + n // 3 + 1`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` must be greater than 4**
