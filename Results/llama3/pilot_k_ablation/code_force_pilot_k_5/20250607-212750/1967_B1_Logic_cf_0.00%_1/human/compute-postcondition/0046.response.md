Output: **t is a positive integer greater than 1, T is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, n is an integer, m is an integer, ans is the sum of n // i + 1 for i from 1 to min(n, m), b is min(n, m), min(n, m) is greater than or equal to 1, and the sum of n // i + 1 for i from 1 to min(n, m) which is ans is being printed**
