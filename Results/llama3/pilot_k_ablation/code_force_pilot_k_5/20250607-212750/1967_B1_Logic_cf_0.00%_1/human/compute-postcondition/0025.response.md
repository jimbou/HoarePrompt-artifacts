Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `T` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `ans` is `n + 1 + n // 2 + 1 + n // 3 + 1 + n // 4 + 1`, `b` is 4, `min(n, m)` must be greater than or equal to 4**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the additional term `n // 4 + 1`, where `n // 4` is the integer division of `n` by 4, and `+ 1` is added to the result. The other variables remain unchanged.
