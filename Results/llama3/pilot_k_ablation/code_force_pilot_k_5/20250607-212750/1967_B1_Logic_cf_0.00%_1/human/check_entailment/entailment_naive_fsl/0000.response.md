Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the conditions. The issue lies in the line `ans = ans + n // b + 1`. This line is adding `n // b + 1` to the answer for every `b` from 1 to `min(n, m)`, which is not correct.

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible values of `b` and for each `b`, iterate over all possible values of `a` that satisfy the condition `a+b is a multiple of b * gcd(a,b)`. The program does not correctly implement this logic.

For example, when `n = 10` and `m = 8`, the program outputs `19`, but the correct answer is `14`. This is because the program is counting some pairs multiple times.
