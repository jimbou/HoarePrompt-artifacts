According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is at least 4 and `i` is now 0.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 0, `_` is 2**
