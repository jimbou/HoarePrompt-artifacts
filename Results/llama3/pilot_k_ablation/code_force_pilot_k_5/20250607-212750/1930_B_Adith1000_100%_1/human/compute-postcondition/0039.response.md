Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of integers from 1 to n with a[1] = n, a[0] = 1, i is 0, _ is 2**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is modified at indices 0 and 1. The value at index 1 is set to `n - i`, which is `n - 0 = n`. The value at index 0 is set to `i + 1`, which is `0 + 1 = 1`. The variable `i` remains unchanged with a value of 0. The variable `_` also remains unchanged with a value of 2.
