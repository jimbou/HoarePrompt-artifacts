The only variables in the loop head are variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases minus one, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1.
State: **n is at least 2, i is n // 2 - 1, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[1] is n, a[0] is 1, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. If the length of a is odd, a[n - 1] is n // 2 + 1, _ is 1**
