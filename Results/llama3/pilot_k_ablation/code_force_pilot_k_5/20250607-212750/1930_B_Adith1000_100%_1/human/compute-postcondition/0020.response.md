According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is unknown, and `_` is 1. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2 and `i` must be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 0, `_` is 1**
