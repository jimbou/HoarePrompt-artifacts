To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is at least 6. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.

Since `n` is at least 6, `n // 2` is at least 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must still be at least 6.

The other variables `a`, `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, `a[3]`, `a[5]`, `a[6]`, `a[7]`, and `_` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[1]` = `n`, `a[0]` = 1, `a[2]` = 3, `a[3]` = `n` - 1, `a[5]` = `n` - 2, `a[6]` = 4, `a[7]` = `n` - 3, `i` is 4, `_` is 2**
