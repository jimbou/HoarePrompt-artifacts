To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `n` must be at least 4, it must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again (since `n // 2` would be 2, and `i` is now 2).

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[1]` = `n`, `a[0]` = 1, `a[2]` = 2, `a[3]` = `n - 1`, `i` is 2, `_` is 2**
