The first line assigns the value of `n - i` to the element at index `2 * i + 1` in the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, this means the element at index 1 is assigned the value of `n - 0`, which is `n`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to the element at index `2 * i` in the list `a`. Since `i` is 0, this means the element at index 0 is assigned the value of `0 + 1`, which is 1. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **n is at least 2, i is 0, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where the first element is 1 and the second element is n, _ is 3**
