To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 5.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is at least 5, `n // 2` is at least 2.5, which means `i` (3) is still less than `n // 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` where `a[0]` is 1, `a[1]` is `n`, `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i`, `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1`, and the rest of the elements are the same as before, `i` is 3, `_` is 1**

Note that the state of `a` is not changed, as it is not a variable in the loop head. Only the states of `i` and `n` are adjusted.
