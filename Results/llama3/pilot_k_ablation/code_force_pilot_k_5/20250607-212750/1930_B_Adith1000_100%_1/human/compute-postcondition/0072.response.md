State: **n is at least 2, i is n // 2 - 1, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where every pair of elements starting from the first element is i + 1 and n - i. If the length of a is odd, the last element is n // 2 + 1. Otherwise, the list a is as described in the precondition. The value of _ is 2.**
