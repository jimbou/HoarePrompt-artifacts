The code snippet modifies the list `a` by assigning new values to specific indices. The first line assigns the value of `n - i` to the index `2 * i + 1` in list `a`. Since `i` is 0, this index is 1, and the value assigned is `n - 0`, which is simply `n`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to the index `2 * i` in list `a`. Since `i` is 0, this index is 0, and the value assigned is `0 + 1`, which is 1.

Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[0] is 1, a[1] is n, and the rest of the elements are the same as before, i is 0, _ is 1**
