The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the input value, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, so for the loop to execute again _ must be 2.
State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[0] is 1, a[1] is n, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, and the rest of the elements are the same as before, i is n // 2 - 1, _ is 2**
