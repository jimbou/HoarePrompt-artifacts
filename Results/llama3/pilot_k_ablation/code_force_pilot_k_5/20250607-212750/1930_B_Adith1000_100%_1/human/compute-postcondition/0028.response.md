To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 5.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 4. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 6, so that `n // 2` is greater than 4.

The state of `a` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[0] is 1, a[1] is n, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, and the rest of the elements are the same as before, `i` is 4, `_` is 1**
