Postcondition: ***n is at least 2, i is n // 2 - 1, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[1] is n, a[0] is 1, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. If the length of a is odd, a[n - 1] is n // 2 + 1. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input, _ is 0.***
