The print statement will print the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

The list `a` is defined as follows:

- `a[0]` is 1
- `a[1]` is `n`
- `a[2 * i + 1]` is `n - i` for `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`
- `a[2 * i]` is `i + 1` for `i` from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`
- If the length of `a` is an odd number, then `a[n - 1]` is `n // 2 + 1`

Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, the list `a` will have at least 2 elements.

The `*` operator in the print statement is used to unpack the elements of the list `a` and print them separated by spaces.

Therefore, the output will be a sequence of integers separated by spaces, where the first element is 1, the second element is `n`, and the remaining elements follow the pattern described above.

Output: **1, n, n - 0, 1, n - 1, 2, ..., n // 2 + 1 (if the length of a is an odd number)**
