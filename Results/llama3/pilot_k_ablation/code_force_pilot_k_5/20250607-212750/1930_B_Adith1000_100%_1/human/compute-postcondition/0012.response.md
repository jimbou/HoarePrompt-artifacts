Output State: **n is at least 2, i is n // 2 - 1, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[1] is n, a[0] is 1, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input, _ is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of 'n' remains the same, the value of 'i' is the integer division of 'n' by 2 minus 1, the list 'a' is modified such that the elements at even indices are assigned values from 1 to 'n // 2' and the elements at odd indices are assigned values from 'n' down to 'n // 2' + 1, and the rest of the elements in the list remain unchanged. The state of the other variables, 'stdin' and '_', remains unchanged.
