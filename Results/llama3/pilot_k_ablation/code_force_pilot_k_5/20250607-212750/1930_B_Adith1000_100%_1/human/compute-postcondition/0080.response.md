The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than 8.
State: **n is an integer greater than 8, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, the value at index 2*i is i+1, the value at index 2 * 2 + 1 is n - 2, the value at index 2 * 2 is 2 + 1, and the rest of the values are from 1 to n, i is 3**
