The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[1]` = `n`, `a[0]` = 1, `i` is 1, `_` is 2**
