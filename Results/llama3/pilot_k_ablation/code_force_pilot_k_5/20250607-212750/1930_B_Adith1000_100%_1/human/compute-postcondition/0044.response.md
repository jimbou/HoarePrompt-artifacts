The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 6.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 6, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[1] = n`, `a[0] = 1`, `a[2] = 3`, `a[3] = n - 1`, `a[5] = n - 2`, `i` is 3, `_` is 2**
