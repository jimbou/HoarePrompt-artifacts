To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.

The state of `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the loop.

The state of `a` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

The state of `stdin` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

The state of `_` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[1] is n, a[0] is 1, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input, _ is 0**
