The code modifies the list `a` and does not affect the variables `n`, `i`, or `_`. The first line assigns the value of `n - i` to `a[2 * i + 1]`, and the second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `a[2 * i]`. Since `i` is 1, the first line assigns `n - 1` to `a[3]`, and the second line assigns 2 to `a[2]`.

Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 4, a is a list of integers from 1 to n with a[1] = n, a[0] = 1, a[2] = 2, a[3] = n - 1, i is 1, _ is 2**
