The code snippet provided modifies the list `a` at specific indices based on the value of `i`. Since `i` is 1, the code will modify the values at indices 3 (2*1+1) and 2 (2*1).

Initially, the value at index 3 is `n-1` (since `i` is 1), and the value at index 2 is 2 (since `i+1` is 2). After executing the code, the value at index 3 becomes `n-1` (unchanged), and the value at index 2 becomes 2 (unchanged).

The rest of the values in the list `a` remain the same, as they are not affected by the code. The values at indices 2*i+1 and 2*i for other values of `i` are not modified, as the code only executes for `i` equal to 1.

The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The variable `i` also remains unchanged, as it is not reassigned or modified.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, the value at index 2*i is i+1, and the rest of the values are from 1 to n, i is 1**
