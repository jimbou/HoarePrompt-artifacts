The only variable in the loop head is variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_`. If `_` is less than the input, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i`, `a[2 * i] = i + 1` for all `i` in range(`n // 2`), `_` is 3**
