Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3). Each test case contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(range(1, n + 1))
    for i in range(n // 2):
        a[2 * i + 1] = n - i
        a[2 * i] = i + 1
    if len(a) % 2 == 1:
        a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1
    print(*a)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 2, i is n // 2 - 1, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[1] is n, a[0] is 1, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. If the length of a is odd, a[n - 1] is n // 2 + 1. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input, _ is 0, and the list a is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[0] is 1, a[1] is n, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, and the rest of the elements are the same as before, i is n // 2 - 1, _ is 1. If the length of a is an odd number, then a[n - 1] is n // 2 + 1, and the elements of the list a are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i`, `a[2 * i] = i + 1` for all `i` in range(`n // 2`), `_` is 2. If the length of `a` is an odd number, then `a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1`, and the list `a` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is at least 2, i is n // 2 - 1, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where every pair of elements starting from the first element is i + 1 and n - i. If the length of a is odd, the last element is n // 2 + 1. Otherwise, the list a is as described in the precondition. The value of _ is 3., and the list a is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer, a is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, the value at index 2*i is i+1, and the rest of the values are from 1 to n. If the length of a is odd, the value at index n-1 is n//2 + 1., and the list a is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
