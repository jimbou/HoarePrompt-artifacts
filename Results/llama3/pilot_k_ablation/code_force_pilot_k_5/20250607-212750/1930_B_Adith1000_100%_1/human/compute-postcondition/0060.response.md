To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2.


For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n // 2`. Since `i` is 1, it is already less than `n // 2` (which is at least 1). However, to ensure the loop can execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.


So, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.


The state of `n` does not need to be changed, as it is not affected by the loop iteration.


The state of `a` is not directly related to the loop head, so it remains the same.


The state of `_` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains the same.


State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n where the first element is 1, the second element is n, the third element is n - i, and the fourth element is i + 1, `_` is 3**
