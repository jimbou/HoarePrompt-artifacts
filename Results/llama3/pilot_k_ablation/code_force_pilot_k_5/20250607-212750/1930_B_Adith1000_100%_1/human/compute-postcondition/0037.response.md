Output State: **n is an integer that must be at least 2, a is a list of integers from 1 to n, i is no longer defined, _ is 2**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, this value is also at least 2. The second line assigns a list of integers from 1 to `n` to `a`. This list includes all integers from 1 to `n`, inclusive. The values of `i` and `_` are not affected by the code, but `i` is no longer defined because it was not reassigned a value.
