Output State: **n is at least 2, i is n // 2 - 1, a is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[1] is n, a[0] is 1, a[2 * i + 1] is n - i, a[2 * i] is i + 1, a[n - 1] is n // 2 + 1, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged. The current value of the length of a is odd. stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input, _ is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `a[n - 1]` has been updated to `n // 2 + 1`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains integers from 1 to `n`, with specific values at indices 0, 1, `2 * i`, and `2 * i + 1`, and the length of `a` is still odd. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one input, and the value of `_` is still 0.
