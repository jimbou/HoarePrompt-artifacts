To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop. The states of `a`, `stdin`, and `_` are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n where a[1] is n, a[0] is 1, a[5] is n - 2, a[4] is 3, and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one input, _ is 0**
