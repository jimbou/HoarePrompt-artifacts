To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // 2):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Since `n` is at least 2, it must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `a` is not affected by the loop head, so it remains the same.

The state of `_` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to n where the first element is 1, the second element is n, the third element is n - i, the fourth element is i + 1, the fifth element is n - i, and the sixth element is i + 1, `_` is 3**
