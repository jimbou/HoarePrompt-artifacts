Based on the precondition, the list `a` has a specific structure. The value at index `2*i+1` is `n-i`, the value at index `2*i` is `i+1`, and the rest of the values are from 1 to `n`. If the length of `a` is odd, the value at index `n-1` is `n//2 + 1`.

When the `print(*a)` statement is executed, it will print all the elements of the list `a` separated by spaces.

To determine the exact output, let's analyze the structure of the list `a`:

* The value at index `2*i+1` is `n-i`, which means that the values at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) will be `n-i`, where `i` is the index divided by 2.
* The value at index `2*i` is `i+1`, which means that the values at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) will be `i+1`, where `i` is the index divided by 2.
* The rest of the values are from 1 to `n`, which means that the remaining indices will have values from 1 to `n`.

If the length of `a` is odd, the value at index `n-1` is `n//2 + 1`.

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `a`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `a` in the order they appear in the list.

Output: **The elements of the list a, where the values at odd indices are n-i, the values at even indices are i+1, and the remaining indices have values from 1 to n, with the value at index n-1 being n//2 + 1 if the length of a is odd**
