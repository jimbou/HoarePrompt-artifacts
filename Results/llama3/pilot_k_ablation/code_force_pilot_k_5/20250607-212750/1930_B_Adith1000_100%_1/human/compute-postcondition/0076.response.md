The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers where the value at index 2*i+1 is n-i, the value at index 2*i is i+1, and the rest of the values are from 1 to n, `i` is 1**
