Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of integers from 1 to `n` with `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i`, `a[2 * i] = i + 1` for all `i` in range(`n // 2`), `a[n - 1] = n // 2 + 1`, `_` is 2, the current value of the length of `a` is an odd number.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same, which is at least 2. The list `a` still contains integers from 1 to `n`, but the last element `a[n - 1]` has been updated to `n // 2 + 1`. The other elements of `a` maintain their original values, where `a[2 * i + 1] = n - i` and `a[2 * i] = i + 1` for all `i` in range(`n // 2`). The value of `_` remains 2, and the length of `a` is still an odd number.
