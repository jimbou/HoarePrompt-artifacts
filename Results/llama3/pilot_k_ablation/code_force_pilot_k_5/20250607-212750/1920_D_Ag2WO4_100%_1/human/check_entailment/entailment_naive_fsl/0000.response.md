Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input contains a query that is larger than the size of the array after all operations. In this case, the program will not be able to find the correct answer because it does not handle this case properly.

For example, if the input is:

5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will not be able to find the correct answer for the query 20 because it is larger than the size of the array after all operations.

The program should handle this case by checking if the query is larger than the size of the array and returning an error message or a special value to indicate that the query is out of range.
