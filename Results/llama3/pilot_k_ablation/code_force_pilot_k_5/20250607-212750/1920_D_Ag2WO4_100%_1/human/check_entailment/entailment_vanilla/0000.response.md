Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1.  The program starts by initializing an empty list `a` and an empty dictionary `b`. It then reads the number of test cases and iterates over each test case.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It then initializes the list `a` with a single element `0` and an empty dictionary `b`.
3.  The program then iterates over each operation. If the operation type is `1`, it increments the last element of `a` by `1` and stores the value `e` in the dictionary `b` with the key being the current length of `a`. If the operation type is `2`, it appends a new element to `a` which is the product of the last element of `a` and `e + 1`. If the last element of `a` exceeds `10^19`, it skips the remaining operations.
4.  After all operations are processed, the program reverses the list `a`.
5.  The program then reads the queries and applies the function `func_1` to each query. The function `func_1` takes a query `x` and returns the value at index `x` in the array `a`. If `x` is directly available in the dictionary `b`, it returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, it repeatedly applies the modulo operation with the elements of `a` until it finds a value that is present in the dictionary `b`.
6.  Finally, the program prints the results of the queries.

Correctness: **True**
