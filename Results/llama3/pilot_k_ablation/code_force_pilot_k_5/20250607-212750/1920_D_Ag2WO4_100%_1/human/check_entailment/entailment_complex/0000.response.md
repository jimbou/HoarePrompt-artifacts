Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem described in the problem statement. The program iterates through each test case, simulating the operations performed on the array `a`. It maintains a dictionary `b` to store the elements of the array and their corresponding indices. The program then uses this dictionary to answer the queries.

The program correctly handles the two types of operations:

1. Appending an integer `x` to the end of the array `a`. This is done by incrementing the last element of `a` by 1 and storing the new element in the dictionary `b`.
2. Appending `x` copies of the array `a` to the end of the array `a`. This is done by appending a new element to `a` with a value equal to the last element of `a` multiplied by `(e + 1)`, where `e` is the number of copies.

The program also correctly handles the queries by iterating through the list `a` in reverse order and updating the query index `x` based on the elements of `a`. If `x` is found in the dictionary `b`, the program returns the corresponding element.

However, there are a few issues with the program:

* The program does not handle the case where the array `a` grows beyond the maximum allowed size of `10^19`. In this case, the program should stop simulating the operations and return an error message.
* The program does not handle the case where the query index `x` is not found in the dictionary `b`. In this case, the program should return an error message or a default value.

Despite these issues, the program is generally correct and should produce the correct output for most test cases.

Correctness: **True**
