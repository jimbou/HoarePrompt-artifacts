Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The program uses a list `a` to store the size of the array after each operation and a dictionary `b` to store the elements of the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases and then for each test case, it reads the number of operations and queries. It then iterates through the operations, updating the size of the array and storing the elements in the dictionary `b`.

After all operations are processed, the program reads the queries and for each query, it calls the function `func_1` to determine the k-th element of the array. The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and checks if it is in the dictionary `b`. If it is, it returns the corresponding element. If it is not, it iterates through the list `a` to find the correct element.

The program then prints the results of the queries.

Based on the execution summary, the function `func_1` correctly determines the k-th element of the array by iterating through the list `a` and checking if the updated `x` is in the dictionary `b`.

Therefore, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
