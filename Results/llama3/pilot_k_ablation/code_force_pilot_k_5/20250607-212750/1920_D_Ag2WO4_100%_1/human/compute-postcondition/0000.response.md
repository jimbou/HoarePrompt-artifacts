Output State: **x is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, x contains two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.**

In this output state, the value of x has been converted to an integer, but its original structure and contents remain the same. The number of test cases, the values of n and q, the operations, and the queries are still present in the same format as before. The only change is that the value of x is now an integer, representing the number of test cases.
