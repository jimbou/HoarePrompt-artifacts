Postcondition: **The program returns the xth element of list b if x is an element of b. Otherwise, the program does not return any value, and the state of the program remains unchanged, with x still being an integer between 1 and the fourth element in list a (inclusive), and not an element of b, a still being a list with at least 4 elements, i still being the fourth element in a, and stdin still containing x-1 test cases, each with two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.**
