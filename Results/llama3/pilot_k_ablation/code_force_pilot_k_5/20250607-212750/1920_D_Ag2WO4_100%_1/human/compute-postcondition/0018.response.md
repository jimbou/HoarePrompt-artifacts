Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and the fourth element in list `a` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries.**

The value of `x` is updated to be between 1 and the fourth element in list `a` (inclusive), by subtracting 1 from `x`, taking the modulus of the result with `i` (the fourth element in `a`), and then adding 1. This ensures that `x` remains within the specified range. The other variables and stdin remain unchanged.
