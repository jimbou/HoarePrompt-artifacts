Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and the value of `i` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries. Additionally, `x` is not in `b`.**

The value of `x` is updated to `(x - 1) % i + 1`, which means it is shifted one position to the right in the range from 1 to `i` (inclusive), wrapping around to the beginning of the range if it was already at the end. The other variables and the stdin remain unchanged.
