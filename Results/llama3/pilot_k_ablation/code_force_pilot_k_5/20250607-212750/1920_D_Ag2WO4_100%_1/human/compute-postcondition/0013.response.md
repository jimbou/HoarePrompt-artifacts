To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `a` has at least 3 elements and `i` is the third element in `a`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `a`, and `x` is an integer between 1 and the value of `i` (inclusive).

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` to the next element in `a`, and ensure that `a` has at least 3 elements. We also need to update the value of `x` to be between 1 and the new value of `i` (inclusive), and ensure that `x` is not an element of `b`.

Additionally, since `x` is not an element of `b`, we don't need to worry about the program returning a value at index `x` in list `b`.

State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and the value of `i` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries.**
