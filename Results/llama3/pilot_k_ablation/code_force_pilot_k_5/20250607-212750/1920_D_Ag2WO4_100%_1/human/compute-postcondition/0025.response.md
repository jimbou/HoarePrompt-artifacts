Output State: **The program either returns the xth element of list b if x is an element of b, or does nothing if x is not an element of b, while maintaining the initial state where x is an integer between 1 and the last element in list a (inclusive), x is not an element of b, a is a list with at least as many elements as the number of iterations, i is the last element in a, and stdin contains x-1 test cases, each with two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the program will either return the value at index x in list b if x is present in b, or it will not return any value if x is not in b. The state of the program remains unchanged, with x being an integer between 1 and the last element in list a (inclusive), and not an element of b. List a must have at least as many elements as the number of iterations, and i is the last element in a. The input stream (stdin) still contains x-1 test cases, each with two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.
