Postcondition: **The program either returns the xth element of list b if x is an element of b, or does nothing if x is not an element of b, while maintaining the initial state where x is an integer between 1 and the fifth element in list a (inclusive), x is not an element of b, a is a list with at least 5 elements, i is the fifth element in a, and stdin contains x-1 test cases, each with two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.**
