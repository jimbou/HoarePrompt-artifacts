Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *x is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, x contains two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries. x is not an element of b
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x = (x - 1) % i + 1
    if x in b:
        return b[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 1 and the value of `i` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries. Additionally, `x` is not in `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and the value of `i` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the value at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and the third element in list `a` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the value at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the operations.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The program returns the xth element of list b if x is an element of b. Otherwise, the program does not return any value, and the state of the program remains unchanged, with x still being an integer between 1 and the fourth element in list a (inclusive), and not an element of b, a still being a list with at least 4 elements, i still being the fourth element in a, and stdin still containing x-1 test cases, each with two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: The program either returns the xth element of list b if x is an element of b, or does nothing if x is not an element of b, while maintaining the initial state where x is an integer between 1 and the fifth element in list a (inclusive), x is not an element of b, a is a list with at least 5 elements, i is the fifth element in a, and stdin contains x-1 test cases, each with two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
