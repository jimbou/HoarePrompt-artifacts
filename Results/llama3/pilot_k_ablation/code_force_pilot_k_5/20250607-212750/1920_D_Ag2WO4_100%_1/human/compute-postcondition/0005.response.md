Output State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and the value of `i` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been updated to be between 1 and the value of `i` (inclusive), due to the modulo operation with `i`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same input, but one test case has been processed, leaving `x-1` test cases remaining.
