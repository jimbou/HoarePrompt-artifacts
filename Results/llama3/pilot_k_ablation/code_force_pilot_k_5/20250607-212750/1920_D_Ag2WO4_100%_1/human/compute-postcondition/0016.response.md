Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and the third element in list `a` (inclusive), `x` is not an element of `b`, `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `a`, and stdin contains `x-1` test cases, each with two integers `n` and `q`, followed by `n` lines describing the operations, and a line containing `q` queries. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the value at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program continues with the rest of the operations.***
