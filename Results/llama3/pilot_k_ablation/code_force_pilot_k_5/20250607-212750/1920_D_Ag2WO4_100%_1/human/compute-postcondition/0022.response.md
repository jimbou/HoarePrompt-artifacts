Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and the fifth element in list a (inclusive), x is not an element of b, a is a list with at least 5 elements, i is the fifth element in a, and stdin contains x-1 test cases, each with two integers n and q, followed by n lines describing the operations, and a line containing q queries.**

The value of x is updated to be between 1 and the fifth element in list a (inclusive) using the formula (x - 1) % i + 1. The state of the program remains unchanged, with x still being an integer between 1 and the fifth element in list a (inclusive), and not an element of b. The values of a, i, and stdin are not affected by the code.
