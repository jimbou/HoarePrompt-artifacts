#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5.
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of a positive integer n, where n is between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive).

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a positive integer n as input and returns the sum of its digits. The input integer n is expected to be between 1 and 2 * 10^5 (inclusive). The function does not modify the input integer n but rather computes and returns a new value representing the sum of its digits.
