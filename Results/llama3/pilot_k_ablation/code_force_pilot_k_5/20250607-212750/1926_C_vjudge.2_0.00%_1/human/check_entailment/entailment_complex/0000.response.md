Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The problem statement asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given range from 1 to n. However, the provided program only calculates the sum of the digits of the number 12 (hardcoded in the range function) and prints the result.

The program does not take into account the input value of n, which is supposed to be read from the standard input. It also does not calculate the sum of the numbers on the board for the range from 1 to n.

Moreover, the function `func_1` is not defined in the provided code, which would cause a `NameError` when trying to call it.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
