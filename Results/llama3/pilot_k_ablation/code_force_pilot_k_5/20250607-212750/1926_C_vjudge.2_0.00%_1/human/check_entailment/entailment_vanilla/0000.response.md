Reasoning:

The provided program is not a solution to the given problem. The problem asks to determine the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, for a given number n. However, the provided program does not take any input for n, and it does not calculate the sum of the numbers on the board.

Instead, the program defines a function func_1 that calculates the sum of the digits of a given number, and then it calls this function for numbers from 0 to 12, summing up the results. This is not related to the problem description.

Additionally, the program does not handle the time limit constraint of 0.5 seconds per test, as it does not read input or produce output in the required format.

Correctness: **False**
