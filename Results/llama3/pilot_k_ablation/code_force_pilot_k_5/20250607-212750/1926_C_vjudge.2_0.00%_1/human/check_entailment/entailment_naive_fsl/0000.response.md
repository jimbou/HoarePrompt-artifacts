Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to find the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, but the program does not calculate this sum correctly.

The program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of the digits of a single number `n`, but it does not use this function to calculate the sum of the numbers on the board. Instead, it calculates the sum of the results of calling `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12, which is not related to the problem description.

For example, if `n` is 12, the program should calculate the sum of the numbers on the board after replacing each integer with the sum of its digits, which is 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+1+2+3=51. However, the program calculates the sum of the results of calling `func_1(i)` for `i` ranging from 0 to 12, which is not equal to 51.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
