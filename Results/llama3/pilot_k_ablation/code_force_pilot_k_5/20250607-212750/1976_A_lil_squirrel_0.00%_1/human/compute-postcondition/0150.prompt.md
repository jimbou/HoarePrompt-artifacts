Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, results is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the results list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the results list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the results list contains 'YES', letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 'YES', `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password if it is a letter, otherwise `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is a string that contains the first character of the password if it is a digit, otherwise `digits` is an empty string, and password is a string that must have at least 1 character.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 'YES', `letters` is a string that contains the second character of the password if it is a letter, otherwise `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is a string that contains the second character of the password if it is a digit, otherwise `digits` is an empty string, and password is a string that must have at least 2 characters, and `ch` is the second character of the password. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` contains the second character of the password. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` contains the second character of the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 'YES', `letters` is a string that contains the second character of the password and the third character of the password if it is a letter, otherwise `letters` is a string that contains the second character of the password. `digits` is a string that contains the third character of the password if it is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string that contains the second character of the password plus the third character of the password. The password is a string that must have at least 3 characters, and `ch` is the third character of the password. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` contains the third character of the password. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` contains the third character of the password plus the third character of the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 'YES', `letters` is a string that contains the second character of the password, the third character of the password if it is a letter, and the fourth character of the password if it is a letter. `digits` is a string that contains the third character of the password if it is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string that contains the second character of the password plus the third character of the password plus the fourth character of the password if it is a digit. The password is a string that must have at least 4 characters, and `ch` is the fourth character of the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list, `letters` is a string that contains the second character of the password, the third character of the password if it is a letter, the fourth character of the password if it is a letter, the fifth character of the password if it is a letter, and the fifth character of the password, `digits` is a string that contains the third character of the password if it is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string that contains the second character of the password plus the third character of the password plus the fourth character of the password plus the fifth character of the password if it is a digit, the password is a string that must have at least 5 characters, and `ch` is the fifth character of the password. If `ch` is a letter, `digits` remains unchanged. If `ch` is a digit, `digits` is updated to include the fifth character of the password.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
