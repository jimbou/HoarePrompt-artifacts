Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is the string corresponding to the third test case that must have at least 2 characters. If the first character of the password is a letter, `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of the password and the character `ch` and `digits` is an empty string. If the first character of the password is a digit, `letters` is an empty string and `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` has been updated by appending the character `ch` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `test_cases` has at least 3 test cases, `password` has at least 2 characters, and the first character of the password determines the initial values of `letters` and `digits` is still valid.
