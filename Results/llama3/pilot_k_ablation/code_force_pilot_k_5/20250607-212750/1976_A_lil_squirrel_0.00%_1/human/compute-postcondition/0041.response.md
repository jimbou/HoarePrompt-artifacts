To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `n`, `password`, and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 2 test cases, the loop can execute again for the second test case.

At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 1 test case, `n` is the first positive integer, and `password` is the first string in the first test case. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `test_cases` list must have at least 2 test cases, `n` must be the second positive integer, and `password` must be the second string in the second test case.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 1 character, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in the password, `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in the password. If the current value of `letters` is not sorted in ascending order or the current value of `digits` is not sorted in ascending order, then `results` is a list containing 'NO'. If `letters` and `digits` are not empty and the last character of `letters` appears after the first digit of `digits` in the password, then `results` is a list containing 'NO'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 'YES'.**
