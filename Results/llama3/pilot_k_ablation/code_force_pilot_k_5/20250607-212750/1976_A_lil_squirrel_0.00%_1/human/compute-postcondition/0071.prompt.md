Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list, n is the second positive integer, password is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 1 character, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 1 character, if the first character in the password is a letter, then `letters` is set to the first character in the password and `digits` remains an empty string. If the first character in the password is a digit, then `digits` is set to the first character in the password and `letters` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 1 character and has been truncated by one character from the previous iteration. If `ch` is a letter, `letters` is increased by one character `ch` and `digits` remains unchanged. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains unchanged and `digits` is the concatenation of its previous value and `ch`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, no changes are made to `letters` and `digits`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 2 characters and has been truncated by one character from the previous iteration. If `ch` is a letter, `letters` is increased by one character `ch` and `digits` remains unchanged. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains unchanged and `digits` is the concatenation of its previous value and `ch`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, no changes are made to `letters` and `digits`. If the last character of `password` is a digit, `digits` is the concatenation of its previous value and the last character of `password`. Otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 3 characters. If the last character of `password` is a letter, `letters` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it, and `digits` is updated based on the last character of `password`. If the last character of `password` is a digit, `letters` is updated based on the second last character of `password`, and `digits` is updated based on the last character of `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 4 characters. If the last character of `password` is a letter, `letters` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it, and `digits` is updated based on the last character of `password`. If the last character of `password` is a digit, `letters` is updated based on the second last character of `password`, and `digits` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
