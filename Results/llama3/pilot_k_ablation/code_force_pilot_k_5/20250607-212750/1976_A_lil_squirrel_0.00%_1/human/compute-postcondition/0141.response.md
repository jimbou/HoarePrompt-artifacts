Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 'YES', `letters` is a string that contains the second character of the password, the third character of the password if it is a letter, and the fourth character of the password if it is a letter. `digits` is a string that contains the third character of the password if it is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string that contains the second character of the password plus the third character of the password. The password is a string that must have at least 4 characters, and `ch` is the fourth character of the password.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the `letters` string now also contains the fourth character of the password if it is a letter. The other variables remain unchanged.
