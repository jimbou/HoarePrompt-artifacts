Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 2 characters and has been truncated by one character from the previous iteration. If `ch` is a letter, `letters` is increased by one character `ch` and `digits` remains unchanged. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains unchanged and `digits` is the concatenation of its previous value and `ch`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, no changes are made to `letters` and `digits`. If the last character of `password` is a digit, `digits` is the concatenation of its previous value and the last character of `password`. Otherwise, `digits` remains unchanged.***
