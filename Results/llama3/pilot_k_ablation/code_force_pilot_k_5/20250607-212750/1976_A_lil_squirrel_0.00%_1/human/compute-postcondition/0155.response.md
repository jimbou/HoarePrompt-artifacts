Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'NO' at least once, `letters` is a string that contains all the letters in the password in the order they appear, `digits` is a string that contains all the digits in the password in the order they appear, and `password` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. The current value of `letters` is not empty, the current value of `digits` is not empty, and the index of the last character of `letters` in `password` is greater than the index of the first character of `digits` in `password`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged with at least 4 test cases, each containing a positive integer and a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The `results` list now contains at least one 'NO' value, indicating that the password does not meet the sorting criteria. The `letters` and `digits` strings remain unchanged, containing the letters and digits of the password in the order they appear. The `password` string remains unchanged, with at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. The last character of `letters` still appears after the first character of `digits` in the `password` string.
