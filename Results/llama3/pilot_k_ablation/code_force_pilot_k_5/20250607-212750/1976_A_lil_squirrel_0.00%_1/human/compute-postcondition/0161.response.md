According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the password. If the password has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, results is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string. So for the loop to be executed  the password must have at least 1 character and the character is the first character in the password.
