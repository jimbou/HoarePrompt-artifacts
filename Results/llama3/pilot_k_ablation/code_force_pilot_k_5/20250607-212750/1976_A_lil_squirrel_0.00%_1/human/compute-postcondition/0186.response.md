Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `password` is a string that must have at least 5 characters, if the first character of the password, `ch`, is a letter, then `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter, the character `ch`, and the first character of the password which is a letter, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, if the first character of the password, `ch`, is a digit, then `letters` is a string that contains at least one letter, or `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit and the character `ch` is appended to `digits`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, and `password` remain unchanged. The value of `letters` remains the same, but the value of `digits` is updated by appending the character `ch` to it. The character `ch` is the first character of the password, which can be either a letter or a digit. If `ch` is a letter, then `digits` still contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` still contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, and the character `ch` is appended to `digits`.
