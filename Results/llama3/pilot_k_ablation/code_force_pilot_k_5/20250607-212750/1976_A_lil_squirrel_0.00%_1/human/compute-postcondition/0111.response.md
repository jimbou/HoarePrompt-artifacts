Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list, n is the third positive integer, password is the string corresponding to the third test case, letters is a string consisting of all the letters in the password, and digits is a string consisting of all the digits in the password.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `letters` will contain all the letters from the `password` string, and the variable `digits` will contain all the digits from the `password` string. The other variables remain unchanged.
