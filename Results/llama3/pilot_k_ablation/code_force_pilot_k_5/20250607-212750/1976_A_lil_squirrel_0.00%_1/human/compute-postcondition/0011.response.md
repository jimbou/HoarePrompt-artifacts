To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for ch in password:`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If `password` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `password` has at least 1 character.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `password` must have at least 2 characters. Since we don't know the exact length of `password`, we can't determine the exact value of `ch`. However, we can say that `ch` will be the second character in `password`.

Additionally, since `n` is the first positive integer in the first test case, and `password` is the first string in the first test case, we can't adjust the states of `n` and `password` because they are not in the loop head.

The states of `letters` and `digits` depend on the first character of `password`, which is already processed in the previous iteration. Therefore, we can't adjust their states either.

The state of `results` is not affected by the loop head, so we can't adjust it.

The state of `t` is not affected by the loop head, so we can't adjust it.

The state of `test_cases` is not affected by the loop head, so we can't adjust it.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `password`, which must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, `ch` is the second character in `password`, `letters` is a string consisting of at most 1 character, `digits` is a string consisting of at most 1 character**
