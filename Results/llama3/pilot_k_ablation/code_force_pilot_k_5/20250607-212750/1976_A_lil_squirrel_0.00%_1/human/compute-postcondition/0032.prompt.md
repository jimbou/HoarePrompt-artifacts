Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the first positive integer, password is the first string in the first test case, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the first positive integer, password is the first string in the first test case that must have at least 1 character. If the first character in the password is a letter, then letters is set to this letter and digits remains empty. If the first character in the password is a digit, then digits is set to this digit and letters remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 characters, `ch` is the second character in `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of at most 2 characters. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string consisting of at most 2 characters, where the second character is the second character in `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character in `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of at most 4 characters, where the last character is the third character in `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string consisting of at most 4 characters, where the third character is the third character in `password` and the fourth character is also the third character in `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 characters, `ch` is the fourth character in `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of at most 6 characters, where the last character is the fourth character in `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string consisting of at most 5 characters, where the third character is the third character in `password`, the fourth character is the fourth character in `password` and the fifth character is also the fourth character in `password` and the sixth character is the fourth character in `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 characters, `ch` is the fifth character in `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of at most 8 characters, where the last character is the fifth character in `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string consisting of at most 7 characters, where the third character is the third character in `password`, the fourth character is the fourth character in `password`, the fifth character is the fifth character in `password`, the sixth character is the fifth character in `password`, and the seventh character is the fifth character in `password`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
