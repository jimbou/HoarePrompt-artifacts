Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO' and an additional 'YES' is added to the results, `letters` is a string that contains all the letters from the password and `digits` is a string that contains all the digits from the password. Either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the last character of `letters` is not after the first character of `digits` in the password.**

In natural language, the output state is that the number of test cases `t` remains a positive integer, the list of test cases `test_cases` remains unchanged, the list of results `results` now contains an additional 'YES' appended to it, and the strings of letters and digits `letters` and `digits` remain unchanged. The condition that either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the last character of `letters` is not after the first character of `digits` in the password still holds true.
