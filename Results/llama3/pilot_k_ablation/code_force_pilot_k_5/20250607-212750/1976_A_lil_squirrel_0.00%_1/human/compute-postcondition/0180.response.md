Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `password` is a string that must have at least 4 characters. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a letter, then `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter, the character `ch`, and the first character of the password which is a letter. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a digit, then `letters` is a string that contains at least one digit, or `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the string `letters` has been updated to include the character `ch`, which is the first character of the password. The other variables remain unchanged.
