The only objects in the loop head are variables  n, password and list  test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 4 test cases the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 3 test cases, results is a list that contains 'NO' or 'YES'. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 test cases.
State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, results is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the results list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the results list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the results list contains 'YES'.**
