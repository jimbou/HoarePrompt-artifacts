Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, n is the first positive integer, password is the first string in the first test case, letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string**

The code snippet initializes two new variables, `letters` and `digits`, both as empty strings. The initial state's variables `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `password` remain unchanged as the code snippet does not modify them.
