Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 4 characters. If the last character of `password` is a letter, `letters` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it, and `digits` is updated based on the last character of `password`. If the last character of `password` is a digit, `letters` is updated based on the second last character of `password`, and `digits` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `test_cases`, `results`, `n`, and `password` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `digits` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it, but only if the last character of `password` is a digit. The value of `letters` is updated based on the second last character of `password` if the last character of `password` is a digit, but its value is not changed if the last character of `password` is a letter.
