Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 characters, `ch` is the fifth character in `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of at most 7 characters, where the last character is the fifth character in `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string consisting of at most 7 characters, where the third character is the third character in `password`, the fourth character is the fourth character in `password`, the fifth character is the fifth character in `password`, the sixth character is the fifth character in `password`, and the seventh character is the fifth character in `password`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that if the fifth character of the password is a digit, the string `digits` has been extended by one character, which is the fifth character of the password.
