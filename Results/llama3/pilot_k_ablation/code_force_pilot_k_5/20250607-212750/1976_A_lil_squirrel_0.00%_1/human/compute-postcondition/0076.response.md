Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing 'NO', `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is a string where the last letter in `letters` appears after the first digit in `digits`, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in the original `password` string, and `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in the original `password` string. The letters and digits in the original password string are sorted.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer. The list of test cases `test_cases` remains unchanged, containing at least 2 test cases, each with a positive integer and a string of lowercase letters and digits. The list of results `results` now contains the string 'NO'. The value of `n` is still the second positive integer. The password string remains unchanged, with the last letter in `letters` appearing after the first digit in `digits`. The strings `letters` and `digits` are still sorted and consist of all the letters and digits in the original password string, respectively.
