Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 4 characters, `ch` is the fourth character of the `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first four characters of the `password` and `digits` is a string containing the first three characters of the `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first four characters of the `password` and `letters` is a string consisting of the first three characters of the `password`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first three characters of the `password` plus the fourth character of the password and `digits` is a string containing the first three characters of the `password` plus the fourth character of the `password`.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` has been updated by appending the fourth character of the `password` to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
