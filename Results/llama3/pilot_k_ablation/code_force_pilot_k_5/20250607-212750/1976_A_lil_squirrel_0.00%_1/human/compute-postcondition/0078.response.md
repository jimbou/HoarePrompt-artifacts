Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the string 'YES', `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is an empty string, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in the original `password` string, and `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in the original `password` string. The letters or digits in the original password string are sorted, and either `letters` or `digits` is empty, or `password.index(letters[-1])` is less than or equal to `password.index(digits[0])`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, but the `results` list now contains the string 'YES' as its first element.
