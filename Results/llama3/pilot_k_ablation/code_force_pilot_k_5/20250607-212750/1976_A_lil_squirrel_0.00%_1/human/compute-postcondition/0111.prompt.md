Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list, n is the third positive integer, password is the string corresponding to the third test case, letters is an empty string, and digits is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list, n is the third positive integer, password is the string corresponding to the third test case that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the password is a letter, letters is a string consisting of the first character of the password and digits is an empty string. If the first character of the password is a digit, letters is an empty string and digits is a string containing the first character of the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is the string corresponding to the third test case that must have at least 2 characters. If the first character of the password is a letter, `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of the password and the character `ch` if `ch` is a letter, otherwise `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of the password. If the first character of the password is a digit, `letters` is an empty string and `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit, otherwise `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 2 characters, `ch` is the second character of the `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first two characters of the `password` extended by the second character of the `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first two characters of the `password` and the second character of the `password`. If `ch` is not a letter, then `letters` is an empty string. If `ch` is not a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first character of the `password` and the second character of the `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character of the `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first three characters of the `password` and `digits` is a string containing the first two characters of the `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first three characters of the `password` plus the third character of the `password` and `letters` is a string consisting of the first two characters of the `password` and the third character of the password. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first two characters of the `password` and the third character of the password and `digits` is a string containing the first two characters of the `password` plus the third character of the `password`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is a string with at least 4 characters, `ch` is the fourth character of the `password`. If `ch` is a letter, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first four characters of the `password` and `digits` is a string containing the first three characters of the `password`. If `ch` is a digit, then `digits` is a string containing the first four characters of the `password` and `letters` is a string consisting of the first three characters of the `password`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, then `letters` is a string consisting of the first three characters of the `password` plus the fourth character of the password and `digits` is a string containing the first three characters of the `password` plus the fourth character of the `password`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
