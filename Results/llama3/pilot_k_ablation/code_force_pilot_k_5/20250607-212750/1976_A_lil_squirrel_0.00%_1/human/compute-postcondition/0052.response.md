Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 1 character and has been truncated by one character from the previous iteration, `letters` is increased by one character `ch` and `digits` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the variable `letters` has been updated by adding the character `ch` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous values are still valid. The `test_cases` list still contains at least 2 test cases, and the `password` variable still refers to the second string in the second test case, which has been truncated by one character from the previous iteration.
