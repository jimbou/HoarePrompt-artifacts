Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is an empty list, results is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO' values.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations means that the loop has processed all the test cases in the test_cases list. The test_cases list is now empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The results list contains a combination of 'YES' and 'NO' values, depending on whether the conditions in the loop body were met for each test case. The value of t remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the loop.
