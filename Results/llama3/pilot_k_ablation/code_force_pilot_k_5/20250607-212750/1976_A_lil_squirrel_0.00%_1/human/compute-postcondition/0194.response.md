Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO' and an additional 'NO' is added to the results, `letters` is a string that contains all the letters from the password and `digits` is a string that contains all the digits from the password. The current value of `letters` and `digits` are not empty, and the last character of `letters` appears after the first character of `digits` in the password.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still a positive integer. The test cases are still a list of lists, where each sublist contains a positive integer and a string of lowercase letters and digits. The results list now contains an additional 'NO' appended to it, in addition to the existing 'YES' and 'NO' values. The strings `letters` and `digits` still contain the letters and digits from the password, respectively, and are not empty. The last character of `letters` still appears after the first character of `digits` in the password.
