Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 'YES', `letters` is a string that contains all the letters in the password in the order they appear, `digits` is a string that contains all the digits in the password in the order they appear, and `password` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will contain the same values for `t`, `test_cases`, and `results` as before. However, `letters` will now contain all the letters from the password in the order they appear, and `digits` will contain all the digits from the password in the order they appear. The `password` variable will still be a string, but its length will be at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop.
