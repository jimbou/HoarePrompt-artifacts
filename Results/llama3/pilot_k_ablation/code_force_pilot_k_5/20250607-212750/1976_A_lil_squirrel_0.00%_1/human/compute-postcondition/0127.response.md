Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the `results` list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the `results` list contains 'YES', `letters` is an empty string, `digits` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a digit, and password is a string that must have at least 1 character.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `digits` has been updated to include the first character of the password, which is a digit. The other variables remain unchanged.
