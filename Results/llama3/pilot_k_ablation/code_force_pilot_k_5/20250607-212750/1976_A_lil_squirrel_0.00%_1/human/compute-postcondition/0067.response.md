Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 4 characters, `letters` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it, and `digits` is updated based on the last character of `password` if the last character of `password` is a letter, or `letters` is updated based on the second last character of `password`, and `digits` is updated based on the last character of `password` if the last character of `password` is a digit.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables keep their initial values, but the value of `letters` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it if the last character of `password` is a letter, or the second last character of `password` if the last character of `password` is a digit.
