Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the first positive integer, `password` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 characters, `ch` is the third character in `password`, and `letters` is a string consisting of at most 4 characters, where the last character is the third character in `password`.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` has been updated to include the third character of `password`, which is `ch`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `letters` now has at most 4 characters, as it was previously at most 3 characters and has been appended with `ch`.
