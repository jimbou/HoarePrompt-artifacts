Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, `results` is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for n, password in test_cases:
    letters = ''
    digits = ''
    for ch in password:
        if ch.isalpha():
            letters += ch
        elif ch.isdigit():
            digits += ch
    if list(letters) != sorted(letters) or list(digits) != sorted(digits):
        results.append('NO')
        continue
    if letters and digits and password.index(letters[-1]) > password.index(
        digits[0]):
        results.append('NO')
    else:
        results.append('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list, n is the first positive integer, password is the first string in the first test case that must have at least 1 character, letters is a string consisting of all the letters in the password, digits is a string consisting of all the digits in the password. If the current value of letters is not sorted in ascending order or the current value of digits is not sorted in ascending order, then results is a list containing 'NO'. If letters and digits are not empty and the last character of letters appears after the first digit of digits in the password, then results is a list containing 'NO'. Otherwise, results is a list containing 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is a string, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in the original `password` string, and `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in the original `password` string. If the letters or digits in the original password string are not sorted, the function returns 'NO'. If the letters and digits in the original password string are sorted, and either `letters` or `digits` is empty, or `password.index(letters[-1])` is less than or equal to `password.index(digits[0])`, then `results` contains the string 'YES'. If the letters and digits in the original password string are sorted, and `password.index(letters[-1])` is greater than `password.index(digits[0])`, then `results` contains 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, results is a list. If the letters in the password are not sorted in ascending order or the digits in the password are not sorted in ascending order, then the results list contains 'NO'. If the password contains both letters and digits and the index of the last letter in the password is greater than the index of the first digit in the password, then the results list contains 'NO'. Otherwise, the results list contains 'YES'.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `letters` is a string that contains all the letters in the password in the order they appear, `digits` is a string that contains all the digits in the password in the order they appear, and `password` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. If the current value of `letters` is not empty, the current value of `digits` is not empty, and the index of the last character of `letters` in `password` is greater than the index of the first character of `digits` in `password`, then `results` contains 'NO' at least once. Otherwise, either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the index of the last letter in the password is less than or equal to the index of the first digit in the password, and `results` contains 'YES' and 'NO'.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, results is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO'. If the letters or digits in the password are not sorted, an additional 'NO' is added to the results. letters is a string that contains all the letters from the password and digits is a string that contains all the digits from the password. If the last character of letters appears after the first character of digits in the password, an additional 'NO' is added to the results. Otherwise, an additional 'YES' is added to the results.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
