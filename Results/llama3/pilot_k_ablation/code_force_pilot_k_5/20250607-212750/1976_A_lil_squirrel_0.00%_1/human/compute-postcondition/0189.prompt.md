Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, results is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', letters is an empty string, digits is an empty string, and password is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop.
Code of the loop:
for ch in password:
    if ch.isalpha():
        letters += ch
    elif ch.isdigit():
        digits += ch


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, results is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', password is a string that must have at least 1 character. If the first character of the password, ch, is a letter, then letters is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter, and digits is an empty string. If the first character of the password, ch, is not a letter, then digits is a string that contains at least one digit, or ch is not a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `password` is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a letter, then `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch`, and `digits` is an empty string. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a digit, then `letters` is a string that contains at least one digit, or `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `password` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a letter, then `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch`, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a digit, then `letters` is a string that contains at least one digit, or `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `password` is a string that must have at least 4 characters. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a letter, then `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter, the character `ch`, and the first character of the password which is a letter, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a digit, then `letters` is a string that contains at least one letter, or `ch` is not a digit, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `password` is a string that must have at least 5 characters. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a letter, then `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter, the character `ch`, and the first character of the password which is a letter, and `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` if `ch` is a digit. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is a digit, then `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit and the character `ch` is appended to `digits`, and `letters` is a string that contains at least one letter, or `ch` is not a digit.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
