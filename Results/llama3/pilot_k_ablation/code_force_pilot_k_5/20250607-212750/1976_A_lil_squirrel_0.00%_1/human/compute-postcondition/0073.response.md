Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing 'NO', n is the second positive integer, password is an empty string, letters is a string consisting of all the letters in the original password string, and digits is a string consisting of all the digits in the original password string.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `results.append('NO')` and `continue`. The first line appends the string 'NO' to the end of the `results` list. The second line, `continue`, is a control flow statement that skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of a loop and moves on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect in this context.

As a result, the only change in the output state is the addition of 'NO' to the `results` list. All other variables remain unchanged.
