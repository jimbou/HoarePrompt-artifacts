The code snippet consists of two lines: `results.append('NO')` and `continue`. The first line appends the string 'NO' to the end of the list `results`. The second line, `continue`, is a control flow statement that skips the rest of the code inside a loop and moves on to the next iteration. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement does not have any effect in this context.

Given the initial state, we know that `t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists with specific characteristics, `results` is a list containing 'YES' and 'NO', `letters` is a string of letters from a password, and `digits` is a string of digits from the password. The values of `letters` and `digits` are not sorted.

After executing the code, the only change is that 'NO' is appended to the `results` list. The values of `t`, `test_cases`, `letters`, and `digits`, as well as the unsorted nature of `letters` and `digits`, remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.

Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, results is a list that contains 'YES', 'NO', and an additional 'NO', letters is a string that contains all the letters from the password but is not sorted, and digits is a string that contains all the digits from the password but is not sorted.**
