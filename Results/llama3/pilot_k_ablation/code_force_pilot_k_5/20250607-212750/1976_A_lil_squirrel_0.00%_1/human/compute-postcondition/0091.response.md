To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for ch in password:`. The only object in the loop head is `password`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `password`. If `password` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `password` has at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again, `password` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is the string corresponding to the third test case that must have at least 2 characters. If the first character of the password is a letter, `letters` is a string consisting of the first character of the password and `digits` is an empty string. If the first character of the password is a digit, `letters` is an empty string and `digits` is a string containing the first character of the password.**
