According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases. If the test_cases has at least 1 test case the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits, results is an empty list. So for the loop to be executed  the test_cases must have at least 1 test case and the n is the first positive integer and password is the first string in the first test case.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 1 test case, `results` is an empty list, n is the first positive integer, password is the first string in the first test case**
