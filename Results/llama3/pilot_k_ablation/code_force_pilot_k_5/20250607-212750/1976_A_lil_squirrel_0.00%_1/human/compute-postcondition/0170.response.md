Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 5 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `password` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, if the first character of the password, `ch`, is a letter, then `letters` is a string that contains the first character of the password which is a letter and the character `ch`, and `digits` is an empty string. If the first character of the password, `ch`, is not a letter, then `digits` is a string that contains at least one digit, or `ch` is not a digit.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The `test_cases` list remains unchanged with at least 5 test cases, each containing a positive integer and a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The `results` list remains unchanged, containing 'YES' and 'NO'. The `password` string remains unchanged with at least 2 characters. If the first character of the password is a letter, the `letters` string now contains the first character of the password and the character `ch`, while the `digits` string remains empty. If the first character of the password is not a letter, the `digits` string now contains at least one digit or the character `ch` if it's not a digit.
