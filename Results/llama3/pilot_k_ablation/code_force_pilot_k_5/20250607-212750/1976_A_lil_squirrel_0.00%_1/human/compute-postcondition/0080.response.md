The only objects in the loop head are variables  n and password and list  test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 test cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 test cases, n is the second positive integer, password is a string. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 test cases and the n is the third positive integer and password is the third string.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is the third string, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in the original `password` string, and `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in the original `password` string. If the letters or digits in the original password string are not sorted, the function returns 'NO'. If the letters and digits in the original password string are sorted, and either `letters` or `digits` is empty, or `password.index(letters[-1])` is less than or equal to `password.index(digits[0])`, then `results` contains the string 'YES'. If the letters and digits in the original password string are sorted, and `password.index(letters[-1])` is greater than `password.index(digits[0])`, then `results` contains 'NO'.
