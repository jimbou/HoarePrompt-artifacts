To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head variables `n` and `password`, as well as the list `test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `test_cases` must have at least 2 test cases. For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 3 test cases. The variable `n` is the second positive integer in the current test case, and `password` is the corresponding string.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment the index of the test case and update the values of `n` and `password` accordingly.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 3 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the third positive integer, `password` is the string corresponding to the third test case, `letters` is a string consisting of all the letters in the original `password` string, and `digits` is a string consisting of all the digits in the original `password` string.**
