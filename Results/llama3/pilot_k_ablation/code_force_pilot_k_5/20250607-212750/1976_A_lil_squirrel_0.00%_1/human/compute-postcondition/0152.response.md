Output State: **t is a positive integer, test_cases is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, results is a list that contains 'NO', letters is a string that contains all the letters in the password in the order they appear, digits is a string that contains all the digits in the password in the order they appear, and password is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop.**

The code snippet appends 'NO' to the results list and then skips to the next iteration of the loop using the continue statement. This means that the current test case is skipped, and the next test case will be processed in the next iteration. The values of t, test_cases, letters, digits, and password remain unchanged. The results list now contains 'NO' in addition to its previous contents.
