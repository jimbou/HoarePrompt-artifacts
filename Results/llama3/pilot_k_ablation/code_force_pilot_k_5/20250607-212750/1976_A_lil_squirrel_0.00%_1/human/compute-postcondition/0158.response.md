Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `letters` is a string that contains all the letters in the password in the order they appear, `digits` is a string that contains all the digits in the password in the order they appear, and `password` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. If the current value of `letters` is not empty, the current value of `digits` is not empty, and the index of the last character of `letters` in `password` is greater than the index of the first character of `digits` in `password`, then `results` contains 'NO' at least once. Otherwise, either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the index of the last letter in the password is less than or equal to the index of the first digit in the password, and `results` contains 'YES' and 'NO'.***
