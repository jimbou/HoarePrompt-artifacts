Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 2 characters and has been truncated by one character from the previous iteration. If `ch` is a letter, `letters` is increased by one character `ch` and `digits` remains unchanged. If `ch` is a digit, `letters` remains unchanged and `digits` is the concatenation of its previous value and `ch`. If `ch` is neither a letter nor a digit, no changes are made to `letters` and `digits`.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` has been updated to include the character `ch` if it is a letter, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `password` has been truncated by one character from the previous iteration is still valid.
