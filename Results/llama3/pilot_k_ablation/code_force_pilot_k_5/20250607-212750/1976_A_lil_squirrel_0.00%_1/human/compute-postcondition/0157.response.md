Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 4 test cases, `results` is a list that contains 'YES' and 'NO', `letters` is a string that contains all the letters in the password in the order they appear, `digits` is a string that contains all the digits in the password in the order they appear, and `password` is a string that must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. Either `letters` or `digits` or both are empty, or the index of the last letter in the password is less than or equal to the index of the first digit in the password**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains a positive integer. The `test_cases` list still contains at least 4 test cases, each consisting of a positive integer and a string of lowercase Latin letters and digits. The `results` list now contains an additional 'YES' element, in addition to the existing 'NO' elements. The `letters` and `digits` strings still contain the letters and digits of the password in the order they appear, respectively. The `password` string still has at least as many characters as the number of iterations of the loop. The relationship between the indices of the last letter and the first digit in the password remains the same.
