Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `test_cases` is a list of lists of two elements, where the first element is a positive integer and the second element is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and digits that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list, `n` is the second positive integer, `password` is the second string in the second test case that must have at least 3 characters, `letters` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it, and `digits` is updated based on the last character of `password`.**

In this output state, the value of `letters` is updated by adding the last character of `password` to it. The last character of `password` is added to `letters` because the code `letters += ch` is executed, where `ch` is the last character of `password`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
