Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as described in the problem statement. It checks if the password consists only of lowercase Latin letters and digits, if there are no digits after letters, if all digits are sorted in non-decreasing order, and if all letters are sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program uses a simple and efficient approach to check these conditions. It first separates the letters and digits from the password, then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. It also checks if there are any digits after letters by comparing the index of the last letter with the index of the first digit.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including passwords with only letters or only digits, and passwords with a mix of letters and digits. It also correctly handles cases where the password does not meet the conditions, such as when the letters or digits are not sorted, or when there are digits after letters.

Overall, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem statement.
