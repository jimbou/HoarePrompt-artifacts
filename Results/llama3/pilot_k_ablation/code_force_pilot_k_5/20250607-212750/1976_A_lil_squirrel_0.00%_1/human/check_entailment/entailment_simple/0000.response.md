Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the conditions for a strong password as specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of the correctness:

1. The program first separates the letters and digits from the password.
2. It then checks if the letters and digits are sorted in non-decreasing order. If not, it appends 'NO' to the results list and continues to the next test case.
3. If the letters and digits are sorted, it checks if there is a digit that comes after a letter in the password. If so, it appends 'NO' to the results list. Otherwise, it appends 'YES'.

The program correctly handles all the conditions specified in the problem description and produces the correct output for the given test cases.

Correctness: **True**
