Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to verify the strength of passwords based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program correctly separates the letters and digits from the password, checks if they are sorted in non-decreasing order, and verifies that there are no digits after letters in the password.

The program uses the `isalpha()` and `isdigit()` methods to identify letters and digits, respectively, and the `sorted()` function to check if the letters and digits are sorted. It also uses the `index()` method to find the position of the last letter and the first digit in the password, which is used to check if there are any digits after letters.

The program correctly handles the case where the password contains only letters or only digits, as specified in the problem description.

The execution summary provided also confirms that the program behaves as expected, returning 'YES' or 'NO' for each test case based on whether the password meets the specified conditions.

Correctness: **True**
