The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the current value of `xor` to the list `new_arr`. Since `xor` is the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`, and `i` is the fourth element in the list `cur_arr`, the value of `xor` is appended to `new_arr`. The second line assigns 0 to `xor`, effectively resetting its value.

Output State: **new_arr contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of xor and i, xor is 0**
