Output State: **The program returns the result of the function `find_new` with arguments `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Since `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `bit - 1` will be an integer between -1 and 29. The value of `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`, which is 0. Since `cur_arr` is an empty list, `new_arr` will also be an empty list. Therefore, the program returns the result of `find_new` with an empty list and an integer between -1 and 29.**
