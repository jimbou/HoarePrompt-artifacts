Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, i is the fifth element in the list, bit is an integer between 0 and 30, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and i.**

In this final state, the list `new_arr` has been appended with the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`, which was the fifth element in the list `cur_arr`. The value of `xor` has been reset to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
