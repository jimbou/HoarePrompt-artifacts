The code `xor ^= i` performs a bitwise XOR operation between the current value of `xor` (which is 0) and the value of `i` (which is the first element in the list `cur_arr`). This operation updates the value of `xor`.

Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is an empty list, `xor` is equal to the first element in the list `cur_arr`**
