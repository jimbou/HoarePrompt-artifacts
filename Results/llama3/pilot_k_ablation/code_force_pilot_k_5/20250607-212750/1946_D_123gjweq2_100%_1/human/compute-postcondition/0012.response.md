Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `xor` is the bitwise XOR of the initial value of `xor` and `i`. If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor` remains unchanged.***
