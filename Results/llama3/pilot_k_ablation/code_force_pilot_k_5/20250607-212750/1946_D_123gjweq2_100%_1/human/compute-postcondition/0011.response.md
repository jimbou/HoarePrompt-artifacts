Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the first element of cur_arr and the initial value of xor if the bit-th bit of the new xor is 0, otherwise new_arr is unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `xor` is reset to 0, and the list `new_arr` is modified based on the condition specified in the initial state. If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` contains the first element of `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`. Otherwise, `new_arr` remains unchanged. The values of `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state.
