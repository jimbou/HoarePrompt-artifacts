Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list, bit is an integer between 0 and 30, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, xor is 0, new_arr is a list containing the first element of cur_arr and the initial value of xor.**

The code first appends the value of `xor` to `new_arr`, which means `new_arr` now contains the first element of `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`. Then, it sets `xor` to 0. The value of `xor` is now 0, regardless of its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
