Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`, and `xor` is 0. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, `thing1` is 0. The current value of `x` has a bit set to 1 at position `bit`.***
