To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in cur_arr:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `cur_arr` to iterate over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements.
- `i` is the fourth element in the list.
- `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30.
- `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we only need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `cur_arr` and `i`.

Since `i` is the fourth element in the list, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next element in the list. Given that `cur_arr` has at least 4 elements, the next element would be the fifth element. Thus, `i` should be the fifth element in the list.

The state of `cur_arr` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it has at least 5 elements, since we are moving to the fifth element.

The states of `bit` and `x` are not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30.**
