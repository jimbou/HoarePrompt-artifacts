Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `xor` is the bitwise XOR of the initial value of `xor` and `i`. If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor` remains unchanged.**

The code `xor ^= i` updates the value of `xor` by performing a bitwise XOR operation with `i`. The initial value of `xor` is the bitwise XOR of the initial value of `xor` and `i`. After the update, the value of `xor` is the bitwise XOR of the initial value of `xor`, `i`, and `i` again, which simplifies to the initial value of `xor`. Therefore, the value of `xor` remains unchanged.

The condition "If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0" is not affected by the code, as the value of `xor` remains unchanged. Therefore, the value of `new_arr` and the condition remain the same as in the initial state.

The other variables, `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, and `x`, are not affected by the code and remain the same as in the initial state.
