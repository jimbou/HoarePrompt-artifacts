Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`, `xor` is 0 and has a bit set at position `bit`, and `thing1` is -1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the initial variables remain unchanged, and a new variable `thing1` is introduced with a value of -1. The initial variables retain their properties, such as `cur_arr` being an empty list, `i` being undefined, `bit` being an integer between 0 and 30, `x` being a non-negative integer less than 2^30, and `new_arr` containing the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`. Additionally, `xor` is 0 and has a bit set at position `bit`.
