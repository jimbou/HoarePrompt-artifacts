Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, new_arr is a list containing the first element of cur_arr, xor is 0.**

In this final state, the value of `cur_arr`, `i`, `bit`, and `x` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The `new_arr` list now contains the first element of `cur_arr` as it was appended in the first line of the code. The value of `xor` is reset to 0 in the second line of the code.
