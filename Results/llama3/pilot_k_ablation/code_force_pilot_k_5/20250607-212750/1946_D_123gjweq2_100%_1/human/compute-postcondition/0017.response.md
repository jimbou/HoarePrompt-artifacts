To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in cur_arr:`, which means we're iterating over the elements of `cur_arr`. For the loop to execute again, there must be another element in `cur_arr` to iterate over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements.
* `i` is the third element in the list.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to consider what happens when we move to the next element in `cur_arr`. Since `i` is the third element, the next element would be the fourth element in the list.

Therefore, the adjusted state would be:

State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30**

Note that we didn't change the state of `bit` and `x` because they are not directly related to the loop head. The state of `new_arr` and `xor` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we cannot determine their state at the start of the next iteration.
