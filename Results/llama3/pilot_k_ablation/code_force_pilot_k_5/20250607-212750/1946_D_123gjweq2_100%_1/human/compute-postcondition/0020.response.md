Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30. If the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of `xor` and `i`, and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
