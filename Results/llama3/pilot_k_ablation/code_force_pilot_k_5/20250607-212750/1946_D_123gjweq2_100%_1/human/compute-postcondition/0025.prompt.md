Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in cur_arr:
    xor ^= i
    if not xor >> bit & 1:
        new_arr.append(xor)
        xor = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30. If the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `xor` is the bitwise XOR of the initial value of `xor` and `i`. If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30. If the bit-th bit of the bitwise XOR of the initial value of `xor` and `i` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30. If the bit at position `bit` in the binary representation of `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` contains the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the previous value of `xor` and `i`, and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `xor` is 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
