Output State: **`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`, and `xor` is 0.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `cur_arr` will be empty because all its elements have been processed, `i` will not be defined because it is only defined within the loop, `bit` and `x` will remain unchanged because they are not modified within the loop, `new_arr` will contain the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`, and `xor` will be 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever the bit-th bit of `xor` is 0.
