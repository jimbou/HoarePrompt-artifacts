Output State: **`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in the list, `bit` is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `xor` is the bitwise XOR of the initial value of `xor` and `i`. If the bit-th bit of the new `xor` is 0, then `new_arr` is a list containing the first element of `cur_arr` and `xor` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `new_arr` and `xor`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `cur_arr` remains unchanged, and `i` is still the second element of this list. The value of `bit` and `x` also remains the same. However, the value of `xor` has changed to the bitwise XOR of its initial value and `i`. Depending on the bit-th bit of this new `xor` value, `new_arr` may or may not be updated to contain only the first element of `cur_arr`, and `xor` may or may not be reset to 0.
