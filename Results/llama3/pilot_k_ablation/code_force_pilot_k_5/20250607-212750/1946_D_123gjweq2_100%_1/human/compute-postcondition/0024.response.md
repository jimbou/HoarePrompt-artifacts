Postcondition: ***`cur_arr` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in the list, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30. If the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 0, then `xor` is 0 and `new_arr` is a list containing the result of the bitwise XOR operation between its previous value and `i`.***
