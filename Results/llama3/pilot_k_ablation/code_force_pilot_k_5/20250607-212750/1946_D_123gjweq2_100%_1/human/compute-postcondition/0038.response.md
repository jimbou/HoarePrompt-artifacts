Functionality: **This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit` between -1 and 30, and a non-negative integer `x` less than 2^30 as input. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the elements of `cur_arr` and groups the results based on the bit at position `bit`. If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the grouped results and `bit - 1` until it reaches a base case. The function returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of the recursive call, or -1 if the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 1 and the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0.**
