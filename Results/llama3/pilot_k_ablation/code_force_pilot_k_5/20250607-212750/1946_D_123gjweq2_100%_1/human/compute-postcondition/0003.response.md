Output State: **cur_arr is a list of non-negative integers, bit is an integer such that 0 <= bit <= 30, x is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, new_arr is an empty list, xor is 0**.

The code initializes two new variables, `new_arr` and `xor`, but does not modify the existing variables `cur_arr`, `bit`, or `x`. The `new_arr` list is empty, and the `xor` variable is set to 0. The initial state of `cur_arr`, `bit`, and `x` remains unchanged.
