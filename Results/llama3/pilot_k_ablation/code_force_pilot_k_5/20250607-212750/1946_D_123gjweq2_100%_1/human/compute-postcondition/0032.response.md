Output State: **The program returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of the function `find_new` called with the current `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`. Since `thing1` is -1 because the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, the program returns either -1 or the result of `find_new` if it is greater than -1.**
