Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

        #The program returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of the function `find_new` called with the current `cur_arr` and `bit - 1`. Since `thing1` is -1 because the bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, the program returns either -1 or the result of `find_new` if it is greater than -1.
    else :
        if (thing1 != -1) :
            return find_new(new_arr, bit - 1)
            #The program returns the result of the function `find_new` with arguments `new_arr` and `bit - 1`. Since `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `bit - 1` will be an integer between -1 and 29. The value of `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`, which is 0. Since `cur_arr` is an empty list, `new_arr` will also be an empty list. Therefore, the program returns the result of `find_new` with an empty list and an integer between -1 and 29.

    #State: *`cur_arr` is an empty list, `i` is not defined, `bit` is an integer between 0 and 30, `x` is a non-negative integer less than 2^30, `new_arr` is a list containing the results of the bitwise XOR operation between the elements of the initial `cur_arr` and the initial value of `xor`, and `xor` is 0. The bit at position `bit` in `xor` is 1, `thing1` is -1. The bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, which is the value of the variable `thing1`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of non-negative integers `cur_arr`, an integer `bit` between -1 and 30, and a non-negative integer `x` less than 2^30 as input. It performs a bitwise XOR operation on the elements of `cur_arr` and groups the results based on the bit at position `bit`. If `bit` is -1, it returns the length of `cur_arr`. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself with the grouped results and `bit - 1` until it reaches a base case. The function returns the maximum value between -1 and the result of the recursive call, or -1 if the bit at position `bit` in the XOR result is 1 and the bit at position `bit` in `x` is 0.
