Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least -1, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been updated to be at least -1, as it was decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original properties and values.
