Output State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx-3`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to -1. The relationship between `eIdx` and `sIdx` has also changed, with `eIdx` now being greater than or equal to `sIdx-3`. The value of `arrs[eIdx]` is no longer 0, as it has moved to the previous element in the list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
