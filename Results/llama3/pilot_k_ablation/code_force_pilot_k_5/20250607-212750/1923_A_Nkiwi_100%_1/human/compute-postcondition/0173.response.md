Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `sIdx + 3`, `cnt0` is updated accordingly based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]`, `arrs[i]` and is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` is increased by 1, in addition to the updates based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]` and `arrs[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `sIdx` still being less than or equal to `length`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` still being 0, `eIdx` still being greater than or equal to `sIdx`, and `arrs[eIdx]` still being 0.
