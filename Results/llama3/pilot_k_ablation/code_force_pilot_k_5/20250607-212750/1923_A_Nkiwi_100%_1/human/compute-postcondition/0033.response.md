Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial properties, but the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1.
