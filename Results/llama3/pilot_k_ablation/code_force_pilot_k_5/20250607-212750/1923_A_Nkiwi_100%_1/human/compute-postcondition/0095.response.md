Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, length is the number of integers in the input, arrs is a list of length integers with the first element being 0, sIdx is 1, eIdx is length - 1, i is length, cnt0 is undefined**

In this output state, the value of sIdx has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of t is still at least 1, the length is still the number of integers in the input, arrs is still a list of length integers with the first element being 0, eIdx is still length - 1, i is still length, and cnt0 is still undefined.
