Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by 2, `sIdx` must be less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx-1]` must be equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been increased by 1 from its initial state, so it is now increased by 2. The condition that `sIdx` must be less than `length` is still valid, as the increment operation does not affect this condition. Additionally, the condition that `arrs[sIdx]` must be equal to 0 is still valid, but now it refers to the value of `arrs` at the index `sIdx-1`, since `sIdx` has been incremented.
