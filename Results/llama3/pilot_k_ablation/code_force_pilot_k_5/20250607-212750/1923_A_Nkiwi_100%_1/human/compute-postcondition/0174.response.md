Postcondition: ***`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `sIdx + 3`, `cnt0` is updated accordingly based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]` and `arrs[i]`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1.***
