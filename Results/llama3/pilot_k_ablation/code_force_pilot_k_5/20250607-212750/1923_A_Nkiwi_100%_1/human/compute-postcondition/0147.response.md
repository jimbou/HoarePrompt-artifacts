The variables in the loop head are `sIdx` and `length` and `arrs[sIdx]`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx`, `length` and `arrs[sIdx]`. If `sIdx` is less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is increased by 2, `sIdx` must be less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx-1]` must be equal to 0. `sIdx` being less than `length` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `length-1`. `arrs[sIdx-1]` being equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arrs[sIdx]` must be equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sIdx` is increased by 2, `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `length-1` and `arrs[sIdx]` must be equal to 0**
