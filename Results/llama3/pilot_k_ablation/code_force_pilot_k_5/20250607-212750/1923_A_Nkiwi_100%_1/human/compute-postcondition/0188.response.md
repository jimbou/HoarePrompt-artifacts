Output State: **`length` is greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 3, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arrs` still contains integers, and the relationship between `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `length` is still valid. The value of `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, which means the element at the previous index of `sIdx` is 0. The variables `_`, `t`, `i`, and `cnt0` are still in the same state as before.
