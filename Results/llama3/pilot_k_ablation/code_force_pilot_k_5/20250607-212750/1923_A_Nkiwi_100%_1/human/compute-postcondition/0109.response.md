To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is at least 0, but we don't know the value of `arrs[eIdx]`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `eIdx` to be at least 1, so that `eIdx` is greater than 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` can be 0.

Additionally, we need to adjust the state of `arrs` to ensure that the element at index `eIdx` is 0. Since `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0, we can adjust the state of `arrs` to have at least one more element that is 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least 1, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**
