Output State: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least -length, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined

The loop will continue to execute until `eIdx` is less than 0. Since `eIdx` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, it will eventually become less than 0. At this point, the loop will terminate. The final value of `eIdx` will be at least -length, because it starts at `length - 1` and is decremented by 1 in each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop head and body.
