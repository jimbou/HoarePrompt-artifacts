Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is less than or equal to 3, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now less than or equal to 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. `t` is still an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is still an integer greater than 2, `arrs` is still a list of `length` integers with the first three elements being 0, `eIdx` is still `length - 1`, `i` is still `length`, and `cnt0` is still not defined.
