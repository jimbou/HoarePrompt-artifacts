Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `cnt0` is 1, and `i` is `sIdx`. The current value of `arrs[i]` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `sIdx` is still increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs` and is less than or equal to the length. The value of `arrs[sIdx-1]` is still 0, and `eIdx` is still greater than or equal to `sIdx` with `arrs[eIdx]` being 0. The value of `i` is still `sIdx`, and the current value of `arrs[i]` is still 0.
