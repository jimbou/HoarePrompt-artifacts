Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that a new variable `cnt0` is introduced and initialized to 0. The values of the other variables `t`, `length`, `arrs`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1.
