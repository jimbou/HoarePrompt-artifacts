To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0`.

1. **Condition 1: `sIdx < length`**
   - Right before the loop, `sIdx` is 0, and `length` is an integer.
   - For this condition to be true, `length` must be greater than 0 because `sIdx` is 0.

2. **Condition 2: `arrs[sIdx] == 0`**
   - Right before the loop, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, and `sIdx` is 0.
   - For this condition to be true, the first element of `arrs` (at index 0) must be 0.

Given these conditions, we can conclude:

- `length` must be greater than 0 to satisfy `sIdx < length`.
- The first element of `arrs` must be 0 to satisfy `arrs[sIdx] == 0`.

Other variables (`t`, `eIdx`, `i`, `cnt0`) are not part of the loop condition, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first element being 0, `sIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**
