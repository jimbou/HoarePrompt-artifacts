Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0.

This output state means that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in the list `arrs`. The value of `_` has been increased by the number of times the loop executed, and the value of `t` is still greater than `_`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
    eIdx -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 2, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 3, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx-1`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx-2`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx-3`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
