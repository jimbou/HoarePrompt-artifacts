Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`. If the element at index `i` in `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1 and `i` is equal to `sIdx`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt0` and `i`.***
