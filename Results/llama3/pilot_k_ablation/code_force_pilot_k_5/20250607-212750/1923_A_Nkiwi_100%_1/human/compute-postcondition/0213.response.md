Output State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is 1 or 2, `arrs[sIdx-1]` was 0, `arrs[sIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+3]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+4]` was 0. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 2, otherwise `cnt0` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been updated to be either 1 or 2, depending on the value of `arrs[i]`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is now 2, otherwise it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
