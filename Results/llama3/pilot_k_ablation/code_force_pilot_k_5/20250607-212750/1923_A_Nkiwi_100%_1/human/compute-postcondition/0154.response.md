To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0. However, `eIdx` being greater than or equal to -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0**
