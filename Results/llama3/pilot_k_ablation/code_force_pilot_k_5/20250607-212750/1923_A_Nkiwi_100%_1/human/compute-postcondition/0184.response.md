Output State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx]` is an integer, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `arrs[sIdx]` is now an integer, but its value is not specified, as it depends on the contents of the list `arrs`.
