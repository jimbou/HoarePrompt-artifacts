To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0`.

1. `eIdx >= 0`: Since `eIdx` is defined as `length - 1` and `length` is an integer greater than 0, `eIdx` will always be at least 0 (considering the smallest possible value for `length` is 1). Therefore, this condition is already satisfied and does not need adjustment.

2. `arrs[eIdx] == 0`: For this condition to be true, the element at index `eIdx` in `arrs` must be 0. Given that `eIdx` is `length - 1`, this means the last element of `arrs` must be 0 for the loop to execute.

Considering these conditions, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the last element of `arrs` is 0. The other variables (`t`, `length`, `sIdx`, `i`, `cnt0`) do not affect the loop's ability to execute the first time based on the given loop condition.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**
