To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is `length - 2` and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `eIdx` to be greater than or equal to 1, so that it can be decremented and still be greater than or equal to 0. We also need to ensure that `arrs[eIdx]` is still 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is greater than or equal to 1, and arrs[eIdx] is 0**
