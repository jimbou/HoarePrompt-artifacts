Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `cnt0` is 1, `i` is equal to `sIdx`, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The current value of `arrs[i]` is still 0.
