The code prints the value of `cnt0`, which is the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive). Since `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, the subarray from `sIdx` to `eIdx` includes all non-zero elements in `arrs`. Therefore, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in the entire array `arrs`.

Output: **the number of zeros in the entire array arrs**
