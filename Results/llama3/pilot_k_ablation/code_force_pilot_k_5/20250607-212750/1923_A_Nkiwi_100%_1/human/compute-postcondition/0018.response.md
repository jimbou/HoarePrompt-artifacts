Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, and eIdx is greater than or equal to 0, and arrs[eIdx] is 0**

In this output state, the value of eIdx has been decremented by 1, so it is now greater than or equal to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1. The length is still an integer, and arrs is still a list of length integers where the last element must be 0. sIdx is still the index of the first non-zero element in arrs.
