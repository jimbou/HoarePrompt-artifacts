Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0 and `arrs[eIdx-1]` is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than -1, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, but its original value was greater than 0, so the new value is greater than -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
