The `print(cnt0)` statement will print the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`. Since `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` includes all non-zero elements in `arrs`. Therefore, the number of zeros in this subarray is the total number of zeros in `arrs`.

Output: **the number of zeros in the subarray arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1] (which is the total number of zeros in arrs)**
