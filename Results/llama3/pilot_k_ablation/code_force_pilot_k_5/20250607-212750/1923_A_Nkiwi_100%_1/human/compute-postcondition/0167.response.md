Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is 2.**

The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Since `cnt0` was 1 when `arrs[i]` is 0, the new value of `cnt0` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
