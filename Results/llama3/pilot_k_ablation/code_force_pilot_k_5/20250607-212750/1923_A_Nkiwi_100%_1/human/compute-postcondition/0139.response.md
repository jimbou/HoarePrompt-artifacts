To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head and adjust the states of the involved variables accordingly. The loop head is `while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:`.

1. **Condition 1: `sIdx < length`**  
   - Right before the loop, `sIdx` is 0, and `length` is the number of integers in the input.  
   - For this condition to be true, `length` must be greater than 0 since `sIdx` is 0.  
   - **Adjustment:** `length` must be greater than 0.

2. **Condition 2: `arrs[sIdx] == 0`**  
   - Right before the loop, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, and `sIdx` is 0.  
   - For this condition to be true, the first element of `arrs` (at index 0) must be 0.  
   - **Adjustment:** The first element of `arrs` must be 0.

Other variables (`t`, `eIdx`, `i`, `cnt0`) are not part of the loop head conditions, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute the first time.

**State:** **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` must be greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first element being 0 and the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is undefined**
