Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 2, length is an integer greater than 0, arrs is a list of length integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is the index of the last non-zero element in arrs, i is length, cnt0 is not defined**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `eIdx` will be the index of the last non-zero element in the list `arrs`. The loop will continue to decrement `eIdx` until it finds a non-zero element in `arrs` or until `eIdx` is less than 0. At this point, the loop will terminate, and the value of `eIdx` will be the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
