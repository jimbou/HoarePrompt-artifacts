Output State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 3, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length` - 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arrs` still contains integers, and the relationships between the indices and the values in the list are maintained. The variable `i` and `cnt0` are still not defined. The values of `arrs[eIdx]` and `arrs[eIdx+1]` are now not 0, while `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0.
