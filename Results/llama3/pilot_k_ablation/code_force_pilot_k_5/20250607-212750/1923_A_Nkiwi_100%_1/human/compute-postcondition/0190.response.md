Output State: **`length` is greater than 3, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 4, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true, so `length` is still greater than 3, `arrs` is still a list of integers, `eIdx` is still `length` - 1, `_` is still increased by 1, `t` is still greater than `_`, and `sIdx` is still less than or equal to `length` and greater than or equal to `eIdx`. Additionally, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is still 0, and `i` and `cnt0` are still not defined.
