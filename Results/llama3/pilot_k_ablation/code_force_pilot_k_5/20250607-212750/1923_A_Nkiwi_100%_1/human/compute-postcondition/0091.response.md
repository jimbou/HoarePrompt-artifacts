Output: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, and the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` is being printed**
