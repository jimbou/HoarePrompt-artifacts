Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first element being 0, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**

The code increments the value of `sIdx` by 1. The initial value of `sIdx` was 0, so after the increment, its value becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
