Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 3`, `i` is at least `sIdx + 3, `cnt0` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the variables `t`, `length`, `arrs`, `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `i` are still valid, and `cnt0` has been updated to reflect the increment operation.
