You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        length = int(input())
        
        arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        sIdx = 0
        
        eIdx = length - 1
        
        while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:
            sIdx += 1
        
        while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
            eIdx -= 1
        
        cnt0 = 0
        
        for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):
            if arrs[i] == 0:
                cnt0 += 1
        
        print(cnt0)
        
    #State: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), and the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive) which is equal to `cnt0` is being printed

```

Return Postconditions: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), and the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive) which is equal to `cnt0` is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
