Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 3`, `i` is at least `sIdx + 4, `cnt0` is increased by 1**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state are still valid, but the value of `cnt0` has been increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
