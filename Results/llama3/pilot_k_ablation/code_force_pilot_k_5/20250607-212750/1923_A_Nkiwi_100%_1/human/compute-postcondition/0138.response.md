Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 2, length is the number of integers in the input, arrs is a list of length integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1, i is eIdx + 1, cnt0 is undefined**.

The code block first reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `length`. Then, it reads a list of integers from the input, splits them into individual integers using the `split()` function, converts each integer to an integer using the `map()` function, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `arrs`. The `sIdx` variable is set to 0, and the `eIdx` variable is set to `length - 1`. The `i` variable is set to `eIdx + 1`, which is equivalent to `length`. The `cnt0` variable is not modified by the code block, so its value remains undefined.
