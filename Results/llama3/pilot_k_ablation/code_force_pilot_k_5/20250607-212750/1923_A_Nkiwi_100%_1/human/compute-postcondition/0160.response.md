Output State: **sIdx is increased by the number of leading zeros in arrs, sIdx is less than or equal to length, arrs[sIdx-1] is equal to 0, and eIdx is greater than or equal to -1 and arrs[eIdx] is equal to 0.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of sIdx will be equal to the number of leading zeros in the array arrs, and it will be less than or equal to the length of the array. The value at the index sIdx-1 in the array arrs will be 0. The value of eIdx will be greater than or equal to -1, and the value at the index eIdx in the array arrs will also be 0.
