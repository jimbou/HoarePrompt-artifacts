Output State: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least -length, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `eIdx` will be at least `-length`, indicating that it has decremented to a value less than or equal to the negative of the length of the input list `arrs`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` being an integer at least 1, `length` being the number of integers in the input, `arrs` being a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` being the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, and `i` being `length`. The variable `cnt0` remains undefined.
