Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), and the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive) which is equal to `cnt0` is being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has executed `t` times, where `t` is an integer that must be at least 1. The loop has processed `t` test cases, each consisting of a list of integers `arrs` of length `length`. For each test case, the loop has found the index of the first non-zero element `sIdx` and the index of the last non-zero element `eIdx` in `arrs`. The loop has also counted the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive) and stored it in `cnt0`. Finally, the loop has printed the value of `cnt0` for each test case.
