To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `sIdx`, `length`, and `arrs`.

1. `sIdx` is already 0, which is a valid starting index.
2. `length` is the number of integers in the input, which is already defined.
3. `arrs` is a list of `length` integers. For the loop to execute, `arrs[sIdx]` must be equal to 0. Since `sIdx` is 0, we need to ensure that the first element of `arrs` is 0.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, length is the number of integers in the input, arrs is a list of length integers with the first element being 0, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1, i is length, cnt0 is undefined**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `arrs` to ensure that the first element is 0, which is necessary for the loop to execute. The other variables remain unchanged.
