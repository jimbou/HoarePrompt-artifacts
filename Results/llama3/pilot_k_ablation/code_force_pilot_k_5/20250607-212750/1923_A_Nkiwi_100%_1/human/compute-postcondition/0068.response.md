To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is greater than -1, and `arrs[eIdx-1]` is 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `eIdx` to be at least 0, and `arrs[eIdx]` to be 0. Since `arrs[eIdx-1]` is already 0, we can adjust `eIdx` to be at least 1, so that `arrs[eIdx]` is also 0.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0 and `arrs[eIdx-1]` is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least 1, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**
