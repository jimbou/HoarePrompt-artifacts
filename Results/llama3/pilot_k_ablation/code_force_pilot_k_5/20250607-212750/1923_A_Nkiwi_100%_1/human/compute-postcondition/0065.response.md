Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than 0 and less than `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined and `eIdx` is decremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1. This means that `eIdx` is now one less than its original value, but it is still greater than 0 and less than `length - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
