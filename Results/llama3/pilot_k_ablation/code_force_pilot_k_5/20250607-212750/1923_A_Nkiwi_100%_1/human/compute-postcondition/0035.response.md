To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change based on the loop's conditions.

The loop head is `for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):`. The variables in the loop head are `i`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `sIdx + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `sIdx + 2`.

The state of `sIdx` and `eIdx` does not change because they are not modified within the loop body. However, we need to ensure that the loop can execute again, which means `i` must be less than or equal to `eIdx`. Since `i` is now `sIdx + 2`, we need to ensure that `sIdx + 2` is less than or equal to `eIdx`. This implies that `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to `sIdx + 2`.

The other variables, `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `cnt0`, are not part of the loop head, so their states do not change.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx + 2`, `i` is `sIdx + 2`.**
