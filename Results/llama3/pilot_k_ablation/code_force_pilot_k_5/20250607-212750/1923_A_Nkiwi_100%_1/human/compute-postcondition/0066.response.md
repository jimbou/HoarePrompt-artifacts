To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]` since these are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is greater than 0 and less than `length - 1`, and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. However, since `eIdx` is decremented by 1, we need to ensure that `eIdx` is still greater than or equal to 0 after the decrement.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `eIdx` to be greater than 0, so that after the decrement, it will be greater than or equal to 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than 0, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**
