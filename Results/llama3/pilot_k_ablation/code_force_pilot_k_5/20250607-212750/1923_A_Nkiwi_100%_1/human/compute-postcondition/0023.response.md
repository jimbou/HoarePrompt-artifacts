The variables in the loop head are eIdx and arrs, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables eIdx and arrs. If eIdx is greater than or equal to 0 and arrs[eIdx] is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, eIdx is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 and is at least 0, and arrs[eIdx] is equal to 0. eIdx being greater than 0 and is decremented by 1 and is at least 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to eIdx is greater than 0. arrs[eIdx] being equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to arrs[eIdx] is equal to 0 and arrs[eIdx+1] is equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, and eIdx is greater than 0, and arrs[eIdx] is equal to 0 and arrs[eIdx+1] is equal to 0**
