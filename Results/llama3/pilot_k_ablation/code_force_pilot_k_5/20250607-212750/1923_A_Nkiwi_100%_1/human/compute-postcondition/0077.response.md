The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, sIdx and eIdx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `sIdx` and `eIdx`. If `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `eIdx` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is greater than `i` and `i` is `eIdx + 1`**
