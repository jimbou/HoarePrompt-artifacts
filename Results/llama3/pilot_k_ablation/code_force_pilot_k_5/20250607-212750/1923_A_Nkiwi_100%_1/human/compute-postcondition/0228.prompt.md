Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    length = int(input())
    arrs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sIdx = 0
    eIdx = length - 1
    while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:
        sIdx += 1
    while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
        eIdx -= 1
    cnt0 = 0
    for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):
        if arrs[i] == 0:
            cnt0 += 1
    print(cnt0)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`. `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), and the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive) which is equal to `cnt0` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]`, and the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx:eIdx+1]` which is `cnt0` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx..eIdx]`, and the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx..eIdx]` which is `cnt0` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `eIdx`, `cnt0` is updated accordingly based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]` and `arrs[i]`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `sIdx`, `eIdx`, `i`, and `cnt0` remain unchanged., and the updated value of `cnt0` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx-1`, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is `eIdx`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in `arrs` between `sIdx` and `eIdx` (inclusive), `arrs[sIdx-1]` was 0, `arrs[sIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+3]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+4]` was 0, and the number of zeros in `arrs` between `sIdx` and `eIdx` (inclusive) which is `cnt0` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
