To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `sIdx < length` and `arrs[sIdx] == 0`.

1. For `sIdx < length`, since `sIdx` is 2 and `length` is not explicitly defined but is related to `eIdx` being `length - 1`, we don't need to adjust `length` or `sIdx` because the condition is already satisfied given the current state.

2. For `arrs[sIdx] == 0`, since `sIdx` is 2 and we know the first two elements of `arrs` are 0, this condition is also satisfied. However, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to consider the next element in `arrs` (at index 3) to also be 0, because `sIdx` will increment in the loop body (not shown) and we want the condition to hold true for the next iteration.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is that the next element in `arrs` (at index 3) must be 0.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first three elements being 0, sIdx is 2, eIdx is length - 1**
