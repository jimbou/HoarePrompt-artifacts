Output: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `cnt0` is the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx..eIdx]`, and the number of zeros in the subarray `arrs[sIdx..eIdx]` which is `cnt0` is being printed**
