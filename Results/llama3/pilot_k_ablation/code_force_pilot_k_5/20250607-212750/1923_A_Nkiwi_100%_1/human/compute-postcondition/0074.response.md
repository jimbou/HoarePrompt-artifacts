The code increments the value of `cnt0` by 1. Since the initial value of `cnt0` is 0, the new value of `cnt0` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `i` is `sIdx`, `cnt0` is 1.**
