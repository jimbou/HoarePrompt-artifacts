Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, and `cnt0` is 0.**

In this output state, the code initializes a new variable `cnt0` and assigns it the value 0. The other variables and conditions in the initial state remain unchanged.
