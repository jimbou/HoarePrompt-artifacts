Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `cnt0` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):
    if arrs[i] == 0:
        cnt0 += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`. If the element at index `i` in `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1 and `i` is equal to `sIdx`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `cnt0` and `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `sIdx + 1`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx + 2`, `i` is `sIdx + 2`. If the element at index `i` in `arrs` is 0, then `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx + 3`, `i` is `sIdx + 3`. If the element at index `i` in `arrs` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx + 4`, `i` is `sIdx + 4`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
