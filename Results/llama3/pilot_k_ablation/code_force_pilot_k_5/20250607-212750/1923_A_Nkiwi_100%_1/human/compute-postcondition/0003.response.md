To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition: `sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0`.

1. `sIdx < length`: This condition is already guaranteed by the initial state where `sIdx` is 0 and `length` is a positive integer (since `length` is derived from `arrs` which has `length` integers, implying `length` is at least 1).

2. `arrs[sIdx] == 0`: For this condition to be true, the first element of `arrs` (since `sIdx` is 0) must be 0.

Given the initial state, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, but there's no guarantee that the first element is 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to adjust the state of `arrs` so that its first element is 0.

State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first element being 0, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1**
