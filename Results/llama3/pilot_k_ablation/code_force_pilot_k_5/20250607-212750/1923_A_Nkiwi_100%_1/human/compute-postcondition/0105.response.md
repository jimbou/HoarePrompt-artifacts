To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the conditions in the loop head: `eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0`.

1. **`eIdx >= 0`**: Since `eIdx` is already defined as `length - 1`, and `length` is the number of integers in the input, `eIdx` will always be at least 0 if `length` is 1 or more. This condition is already satisfied given the state.

2. **`arrs[eIdx] == 0`**: For this condition to be true, the last element of `arrs` (since `eIdx` is the last index) must be 0. The state does not guarantee this since `arrs` is described as a list of `length` integers without specifying their values.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that the last element of `arrs` is 0. This means `arrs` must be adjusted so that its last element is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**
