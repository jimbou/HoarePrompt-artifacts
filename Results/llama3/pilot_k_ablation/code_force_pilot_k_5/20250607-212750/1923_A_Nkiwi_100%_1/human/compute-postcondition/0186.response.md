Output State: **`length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 2, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx]` is not defined, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `arrs[sIdx]` is no longer defined as 0, since `sIdx` has changed.
