Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first three elements being 0, sIdx is 5, eIdx is length - 1, length is greater than 3, arrs[sIdx] is either 0 or 1**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 5. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1. The length of arrs is still greater than 3, and the first three elements of arrs are still 0. The value of arrs[sIdx] is now either 0 or 1, since sIdx is now 5.
