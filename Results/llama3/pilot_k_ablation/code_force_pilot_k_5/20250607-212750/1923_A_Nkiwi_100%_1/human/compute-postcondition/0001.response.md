To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `_` and `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, _ is 0**
