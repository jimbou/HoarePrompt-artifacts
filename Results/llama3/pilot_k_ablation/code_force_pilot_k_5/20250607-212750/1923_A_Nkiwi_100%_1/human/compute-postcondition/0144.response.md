Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by 1, `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `length` and `arrs[sIdx-1]` must be equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1. The condition that `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `length` still holds true. Additionally, since `sIdx` was previously increased by 1, the value at `arrs[sIdx-1]` is now equal to 0, as per the initial state condition.
