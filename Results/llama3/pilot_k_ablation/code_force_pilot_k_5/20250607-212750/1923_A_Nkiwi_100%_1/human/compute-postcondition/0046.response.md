Output: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`. `cnt0` is equal to the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive), and the number of zeros in the subarray of `arrs` from index `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive) which is equal to `cnt0` is being printed**
