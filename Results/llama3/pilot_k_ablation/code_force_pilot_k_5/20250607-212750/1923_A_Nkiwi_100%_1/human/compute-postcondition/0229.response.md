Functionality: **This function reads input from stdin, processes multiple test cases, and prints the count of zeros in a subarray of each test case. For each test case, it reads an integer length and a list of integers, finds the first and last non-zero elements, and counts the zeros in the subarray between these indices. The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not perform any error checking. It processes all test cases and prints the count of zeros for each case.**
