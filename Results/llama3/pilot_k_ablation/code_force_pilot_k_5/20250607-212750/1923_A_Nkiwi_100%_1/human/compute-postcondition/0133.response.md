Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 3`, `i` is at least `sIdx + 4. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change is made.***
