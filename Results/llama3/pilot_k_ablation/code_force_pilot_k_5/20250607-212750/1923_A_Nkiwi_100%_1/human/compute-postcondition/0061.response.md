Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length - 2`. All other variables remain unchanged, with `t` still being at least 2, `length` still being greater than 0, `arrs` still being a list of length integers with the last element being 0, `sIdx` still being the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `i` still being `length`, and `cnt0` still being not defined.
