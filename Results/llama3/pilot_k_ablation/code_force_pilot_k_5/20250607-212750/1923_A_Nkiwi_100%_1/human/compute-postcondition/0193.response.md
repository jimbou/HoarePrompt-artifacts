Output State: `length` is greater than or equal to 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by the number of iterations of the loop, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the start index `sIdx` will be at the first non-zero element in the list `arrs` or at the end of the list if all elements are zero. The end index `eIdx` remains at the last index of the list. The loop counter `_` is increased by the number of iterations of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
