Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, and eIdx is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, and arrs[eIdx] is not necessarily 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `eIdx` is decremented by 1, but it is still greater than 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that `arrs[eIdx]` is not necessarily 0 anymore because `eIdx` has been decremented.
