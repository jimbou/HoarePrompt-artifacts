To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `sIdx + 2`, and `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes at least `sIdx + 3`. Additionally, `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to `i`, so `eIdx` must be at least `sIdx + 3`.

The other variables, `t`, `length`, `arrs`, `sIdx`, and `cnt0`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 3`, `i` is at least `sIdx + 3**
