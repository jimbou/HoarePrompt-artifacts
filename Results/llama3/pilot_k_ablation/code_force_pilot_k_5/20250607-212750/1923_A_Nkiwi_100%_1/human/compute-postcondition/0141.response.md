The variables in the loop head are `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx]`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx]`. If `sIdx` is less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `sIdx` must be less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` must be equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`sIdx` is increased by 1 and `sIdx` must be less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` must be equal to 0**
