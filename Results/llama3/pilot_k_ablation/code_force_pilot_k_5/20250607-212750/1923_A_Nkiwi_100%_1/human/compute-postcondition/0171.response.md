Postcondition: ***`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `sIdx + 2`. If `arrs[sIdx + 1]` is 0 and `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 3. If `arrs[sIdx + 1]` is 0 and `arrs[i]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is 2. If `arrs[sIdx + 1]` is not 0 and `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 2. If `arrs[sIdx + 1]` is not 0 and `arrs[i]` is not 0, then `cnt0` is 1.***
