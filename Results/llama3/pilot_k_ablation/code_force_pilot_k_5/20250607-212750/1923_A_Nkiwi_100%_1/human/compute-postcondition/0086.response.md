The only variables in the loop head are variables  `sIdx`, `eIdx` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `sIdx`, `eIdx` and `i`. If `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, `eIdx` is greater than `sIdx`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be `eIdx + 2` and `eIdx` must be greater than `sIdx + 1`. Also, `sIdx` must be increased by 1.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` plus 1, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is greater than `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 2. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
