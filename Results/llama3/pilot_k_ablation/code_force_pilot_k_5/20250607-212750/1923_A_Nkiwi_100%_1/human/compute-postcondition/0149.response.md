Output State: **sIdx is increased by the number of leading zeros in arrs, sIdx is less than or equal to length, and arrs[sIdx-1] is equal to 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the start index `sIdx` has been incremented by the number of leading zeros in the array `arrs`. The loop continues to execute as long as `sIdx` is less than the length of the array and the current element at `sIdx` is 0. Once the loop finishes, `sIdx` will be pointing to the first non-zero element in the array, or it will be equal to the length of the array if all elements are 0.
