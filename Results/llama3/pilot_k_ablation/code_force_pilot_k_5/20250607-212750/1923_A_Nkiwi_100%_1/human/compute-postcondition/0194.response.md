Output State: `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0.

This output state means that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in the list `arrs`. The value of `_` has been increased by the number of times the loop executed, and the value of `t` is still greater than `_`. The other variables remain unchanged.
