To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `sIdx`, `length`, and `arrs[sIdx]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `sIdx` is less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is 1, `length` is greater than 0, and `arrs[sIdx]` is an integer.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `arrs[sIdx]` to be equal to 0. We also need to ensure that `sIdx` is still less than `length`. Since `sIdx` is 1, we need to adjust the state of `length` to be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined**
