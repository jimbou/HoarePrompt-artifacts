Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decreased by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `arrs[eIdx]` is still equal to 0, and the values of `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx-1]` are still the same.
