Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, but its relationship with `arrs[eIdx]` remains the same, i.e., `arrs[eIdx]` is still equal to 0. The other variables, `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx-1]`, are not affected by the code and retain their original values. The only change is in the value of `eIdx`, which is now greater than or equal to -1.
