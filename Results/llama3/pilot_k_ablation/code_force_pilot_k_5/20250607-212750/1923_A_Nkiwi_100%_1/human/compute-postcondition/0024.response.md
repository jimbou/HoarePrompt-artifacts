Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, and eIdx is greater than 0, and arrs[eIdx] is equal to 0 and arrs[eIdx+1] is equal to 0 and eIdx is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of eIdx has been decremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
