Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer that must be at least 2, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1, i is length, cnt0 is not defined
Code of the loop:
while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:
    sIdx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first element being 0, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first two elements being 0, `sIdx` is 2, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is 3, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is less than `length` and is increased by 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is less than or equal to 3, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
