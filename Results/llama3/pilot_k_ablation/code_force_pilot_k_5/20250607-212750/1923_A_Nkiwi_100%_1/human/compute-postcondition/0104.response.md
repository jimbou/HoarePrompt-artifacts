Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, length is the number of integers in the input, arrs is a list of length integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is length - 1, i is length, cnt0 is undefined**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `sIdx` will be the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, while all other variables remain unchanged.
