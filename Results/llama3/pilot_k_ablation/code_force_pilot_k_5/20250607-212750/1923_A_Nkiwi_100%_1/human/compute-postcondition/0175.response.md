To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `eIdx`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `sIdx + 3`, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`.

To adjust the states, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes `sIdx + 4`. The state of `sIdx` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head. The state of `eIdx` also remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `arrs`, `length`, `cnt0`, are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `sIdx + 4`, `cnt0` is updated accordingly based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]` and `arrs[i]`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**
