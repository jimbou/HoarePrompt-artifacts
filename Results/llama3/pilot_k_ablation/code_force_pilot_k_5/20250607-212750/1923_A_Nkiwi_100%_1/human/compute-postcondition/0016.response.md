Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is length - 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of eIdx has been decremented by 1, so it is now length - 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: an integer n and a space-separated list of n integers (either 0 or 1). The length of arrs is still an integer, and sIdx is still the index of the first non-zero element in arrs.
