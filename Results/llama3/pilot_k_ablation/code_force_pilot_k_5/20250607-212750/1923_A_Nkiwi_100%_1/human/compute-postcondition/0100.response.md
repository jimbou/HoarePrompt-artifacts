To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `sIdx` and `arrs` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `sIdx` must be less than `length`, and `arrs[sIdx]` must be equal to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `sIdx` is 3, `length` is the number of integers in the input, and the first three elements of `arrs` are 0. For the loop to execute again, `sIdx` must be less than `length`, which is already satisfied since `sIdx` is 3 and `length` is greater than 3 (since `arrs` has at least 3 elements). However, we need to ensure that `arrs[sIdx]` is still 0.

Since `sIdx` is 3, we need to adjust the state of `arrs` so that the 4th element (at index 3) is also 0. Therefore, the first four elements of `arrs` must be 0.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first four elements being 0, `sIdx` is 3, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**
