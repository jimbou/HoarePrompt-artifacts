To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is: `for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`. Since `i` is currently `eIdx + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be `eIdx + 2` for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, since `sIdx` and `eIdx` are indices of non-zero elements in `arrs`, we need to ensure that `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx` for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `cnt0` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is greater than `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 2`.**
