Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by 1, `sIdx` must be less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx-1]` must be equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1. The condition that `sIdx` must be less than `length` is still valid. Additionally, since `sIdx` was previously increased by 1, the value at the previous index `sIdx-1` in the array `arrs` is equal to 0.
