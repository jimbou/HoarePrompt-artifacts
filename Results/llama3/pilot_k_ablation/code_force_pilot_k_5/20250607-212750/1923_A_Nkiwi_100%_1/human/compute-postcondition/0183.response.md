To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `sIdx` and `arrs[sIdx]`. According to the code, the loop can execute if `sIdx` is less than `length` and `arrs[sIdx]` is equal to 0.

Right before the loop, `sIdx` is 0, which is less than `length`, so `sIdx` does not need to be adjusted. However, `arrs[sIdx]` is not defined, which means it can be any value. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `arrs[sIdx]` to be equal to 0.

Additionally, since `arrs[sIdx-1]` is not defined, we need to ensure that `sIdx` is not equal to 0, because `arrs[-1]` is not defined. However, since `sIdx` is already 0, we cannot adjust it. Instead, we need to adjust the state of `length` to be greater than 0, so that `sIdx` is not equal to 0.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 0, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined**
