Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first element being 0, sIdx is 1, eIdx is length - 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The input stream still contains `t-2` test cases, each consisting of two lines: an integer `n` and a space-separated list of `n` integers (either 0 or 1). The length of the list `arrs` is still an integer, and its first element is still 0. The value of `eIdx` is still `length - 1`.
