Output State: **sIdx is increased by the number of leading zeros in arrs, sIdx is less than or equal to length, arrs[sIdx-1] is equal to 0, and eIdx points to one of the leading zeros in arrs that is one position before the previous position.**

In this output state, the value of eIdx has been updated to point to one of the leading zeros in arrs that is one position before the previous position, while the values of sIdx and arrs[sIdx-1] remain unchanged. The relationship between sIdx and the length of arrs also remains the same.
