Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `i` is `sIdx` and `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `i` and `cnt0`.***
