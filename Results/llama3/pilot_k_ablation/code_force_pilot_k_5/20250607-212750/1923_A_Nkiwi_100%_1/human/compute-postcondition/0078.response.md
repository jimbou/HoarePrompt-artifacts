Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is greater than `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1`, and `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial properties, and the only change is that `cnt0` has been incremented by 1. The values of `t`, `length`, `arrs`, `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `i` remain unchanged, and their relationships with each other are still valid.
