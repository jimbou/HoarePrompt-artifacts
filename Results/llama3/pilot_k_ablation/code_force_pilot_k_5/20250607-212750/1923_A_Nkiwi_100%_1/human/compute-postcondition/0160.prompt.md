Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: sIdx is increased by the number of leading zeros in arrs, sIdx is less than or equal to length, and arrs[sIdx-1] is equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
while eIdx >= 0 and arrs[eIdx] == 0:
    eIdx -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: sIdx is increased by the number of leading zeros in arrs, sIdx is less than or equal to length, arrs[sIdx-1] is equal to 0, and eIdx points to one of the leading zeros in arrs that is one position before the previous position.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
