Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is less than `length` and is increased by 1, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `arrs` still has the first three elements as 0, and `i` is still equal to `length`. The variable `cnt0` is still not defined.
