Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first four elements being 0, `sIdx` is 4, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is an integer at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first four elements being 0, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, and `cnt0` is undefined still holds true.
