To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is `length` - 2, which is greater than or equal to 0, and `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `arrs[eIdx]` to be 0. We cannot adjust `eIdx` because it is already greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 2, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0**
