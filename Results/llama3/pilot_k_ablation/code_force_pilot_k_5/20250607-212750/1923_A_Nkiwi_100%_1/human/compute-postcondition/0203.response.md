According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`. If `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is not 0. `eIdx` being greater than or equal to -1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0. `arrs[eIdx]` being not 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx-2`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` is 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` is 0**
