Postcondition: ***`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx-1`, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is `sIdx`, `cnt0` is 0 or 1, `arrs[sIdx-1]` was 0, `arrs[sIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+3]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+4]` was 0. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 1, otherwise `cnt0` is 0.***
