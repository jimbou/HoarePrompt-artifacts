Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decremented by 1, resulting in `eIdx` being `length - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.
