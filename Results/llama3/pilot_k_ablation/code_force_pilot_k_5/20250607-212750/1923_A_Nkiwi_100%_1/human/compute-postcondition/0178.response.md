Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `eIdx`, `cnt0` is updated accordingly based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]` and `arrs[i]`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `sIdx`, `eIdx`, `i`, and `cnt0` remain unchanged.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the start index `sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in the array `arrs`, and it is less than or equal to the length of the array. The value at the index `sIdx-1` is 0, and the end index `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`. The value at the index `eIdx` is also 0. The loop counter `i` is equal to `eIdx`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all elements from `sIdx` to `eIdx`. The count of zeros `cnt0` is updated based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]` and `arrs[i]`. If the current element `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the values of `sIdx`, `eIdx`, `i`, and `cnt0` remain unchanged.
