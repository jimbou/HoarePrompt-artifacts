Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first four elements being 0 and `arrs[4]` is 0, `sIdx` is less than `length` and is one more than its previous value, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The value of `sIdx` is now one more than its previous value, but still less than `length`.
