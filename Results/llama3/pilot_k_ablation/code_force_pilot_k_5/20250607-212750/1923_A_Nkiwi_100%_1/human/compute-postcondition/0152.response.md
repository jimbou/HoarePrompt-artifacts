According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`. If `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` points to one of the leading zeros in `arrs` that is one position before the previous position, and `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0. However, `eIdx` being one position before the previous position does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, `arrs[eIdx]` needs to be adjusted to `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0**
