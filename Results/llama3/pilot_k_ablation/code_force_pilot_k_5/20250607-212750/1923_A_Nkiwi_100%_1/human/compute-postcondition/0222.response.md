Output State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length - 1`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx + 4`, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is `sIdx + 4`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` was 0, `arrs[sIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+3]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+4]` was 0. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 5, otherwise `cnt0` is 4**

The value of `cnt0` is incremented by 1. Since `arrs[i]` is either 0 or not 0, the value of `cnt0` depends on the value of `arrs[i]`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` becomes 5, otherwise it becomes 4. The values of the other variables are not affected.
