To ensure the loop can execute at least once, we need to consider the conditions in the loop head: `eIdx >= 0` and `arrs[eIdx] == 0`.

1. `eIdx >= 0`: Since `eIdx` is defined as `length - 1`, this condition is always true given that `length` is a positive integer (which is implied since `t` is at least 1 and `length` is related to the test cases). Therefore, no adjustment is needed for `eIdx`.

2. `arrs[eIdx] == 0`: For the loop to execute at least once, `arrs[eIdx]` must be 0. Since `eIdx` is the last index of `arrs`, we need to ensure that the last element of `arrs` is 0.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute at least once are focused on ensuring that the last element of `arrs` is 0.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is length - 1.**
