To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`. Since `i` is the loop variable, it will take on values from `sIdx` to `eIdx` (inclusive). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be equal to `sIdx`, which is the starting value of the loop.

Additionally, since `sIdx` and `eIdx` are indices of non-zero elements in `arrs`, we need to ensure that `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`. This is already implied by the fact that `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element and `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element.

The other variables, `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `cnt0`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `i` is `sIdx`, `cnt0` is 0**
