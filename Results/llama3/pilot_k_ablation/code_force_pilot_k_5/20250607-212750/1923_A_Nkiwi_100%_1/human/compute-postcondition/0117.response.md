Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least -length, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is 0**

In natural language, the output state after the code executes is that the variable `cnt0` is now defined and initialized to 0. The other variables remain unchanged, with `t` being an integer at least 1, `length` being the number of integers in the input, `arrs` being a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` being the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` being at least -length, and `i` being `length`.
