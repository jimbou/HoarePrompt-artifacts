Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is greater than `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 2`, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial properties, except for `cnt0`, which has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `length`, `arrs`, `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `i`, which retain their initial values and relationships.
