Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, and `eIdx` is greater than or equal to -1 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `eIdx` has been decreased by 1, but it is still greater than or equal to -1. The other variables remain unchanged, so `sIdx` is still increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is still less than or equal to length, and `arrs[sIdx-1]` is still equal to 0.
