To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(sIdx, eIdx + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`. Since `i` is at least `sIdx + 3` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `sIdx` and `eIdx` does not need to be adjusted, as they are not modified by the loop iteration.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 3`, `i` is at least `sIdx + 4**
