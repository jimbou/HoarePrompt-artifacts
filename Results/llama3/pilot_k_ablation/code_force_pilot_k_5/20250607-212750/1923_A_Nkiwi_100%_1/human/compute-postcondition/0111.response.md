To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]` since these are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is at least 0, and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0.

However, we need to ensure that `eIdx` is not equal to -1 (which would make the loop condition false) and that `arrs[eIdx]` remains 0. Since `eIdx` is at least 0, we can decrement it by 1 to ensure it remains non-negative. Additionally, we need to ensure that the element at the new `eIdx` index in `arrs` is also 0.

Since `arrs` has at least one more element being 0 (apart from the last element), we can adjust `eIdx` to point to one of these zero elements. We don't need to change `sIdx` because it's not part of the loop head.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least -1, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**
