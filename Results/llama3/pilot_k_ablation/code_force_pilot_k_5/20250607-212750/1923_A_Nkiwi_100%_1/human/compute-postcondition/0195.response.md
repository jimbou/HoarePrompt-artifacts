To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `eIdx` and `arrs[eIdx]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute if `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0.

Right before the loop, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, which is greater than or equal to 0, so `eIdx` does not need to be adjusted.

However, `arrs[eIdx]` is not defined, which means it can be any value. To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of `arrs[eIdx]` to be equal to 0.

State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` is 0**
