According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `eIdx` and `arrs`. If `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, because `eIdx` could be 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` could be 0, but there might not be a previous element in `arrs` that is non-zero. Therefore, `eIdx` needs to be adjusted to `eIdx` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers where the last element must be 0, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, and eIdx is greater than 0, and arrs[eIdx] is 0**
