The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, sIdx and eIdx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `sIdx` and `eIdx`. If `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `sIdx + 1`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`. For the loop to execute again `i` is `sIdx + 2` and for the loop to execute again `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `length - 1` and `eIdx` must be greater than or equal to `sIdx + 1`. 
State: **`length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length - 1`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx + 1`, `_` is increased by the number of times the loop executed, `t` is greater than `_`, `i` is `sIdx + 2`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` was 0, `arrs[sIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx]` was not 0, `arrs[eIdx+1]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+2]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+3]` was 0, `arrs[eIdx+4]` was 0. If `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 2, otherwise `cnt0` is 1.**
