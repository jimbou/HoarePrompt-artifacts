Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 2, length is an integer greater than 0, arrs is a list of length integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is length - 1, i is length, cnt0 is not defined**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `sIdx` will be the index of the first non-zero element in the list `arrs`. If all elements in `arrs` are zero, then `sIdx` will be equal to `length`. The other variables remain unchanged.
