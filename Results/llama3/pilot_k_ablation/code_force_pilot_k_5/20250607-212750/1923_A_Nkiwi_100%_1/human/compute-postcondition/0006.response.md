Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first two elements being 0, sIdx is 2, eIdx is length - 1**

The value of `sIdx` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1. The length of the list is still an integer, and arrs is still a list of length integers with the first two elements being 0. The value of eIdx remains the same, which is length - 1.
