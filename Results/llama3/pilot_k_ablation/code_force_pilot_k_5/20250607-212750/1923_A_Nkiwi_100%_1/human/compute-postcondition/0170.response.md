Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `sIdx + 2`. If `arrs[sIdx + 1]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 3. Otherwise, `cnt0` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been updated based on the initial state. If `arrs[sIdx + 1]` is 0, then `cnt0` is incremented by 1 from its initial value of 2, resulting in a value of 3. Otherwise, `cnt0` is incremented by 1 from its initial value of 1, resulting in a value of 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
