The only objects in the loop head are variables  i, sIdx and eIdx, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `sIdx` and `eIdx`. If `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `sIdx`, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is at least `sIdx + 1`, and `eIdx` must be at least `i`, so `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 1`. 
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 1`, `i` is at least `sIdx + 1`. If the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0, then `i` is `sIdx`, and `cnt0` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
