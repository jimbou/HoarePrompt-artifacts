Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx`, `i` is `sIdx`, `cnt0` is 1. The current value of `arrs[i]` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `cnt0` being 1. All other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties. The current value of `arrs[i]` is still 0, as the code only increments the count of zeros but does not modify the array elements.
