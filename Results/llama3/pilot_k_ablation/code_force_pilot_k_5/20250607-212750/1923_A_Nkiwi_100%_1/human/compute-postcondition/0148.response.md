Output State: **`sIdx` is increased by 3, `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `length-1` and `arrs[sIdx-1]` must be equal to 0**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now increased by 3. The condition that `sIdx` must be less than or equal to `length-1` is still valid. Additionally, since `sIdx` was previously increased by 2 and `arrs[sIdx]` was equal to 0, now `arrs[sIdx-1]` must be equal to 0.
