Output State: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers, sIdx is the index of the first non-zero element in arrs, eIdx is the index of the last non-zero element in arrs.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `eIdx` variable will point to the index of the last non-zero element in the `arrs` list. If all elements in the list are zero, `eIdx` will be equal to -1. The `sIdx` variable remains unchanged, pointing to the index of the first non-zero element in the `arrs` list. The other variables `t`, `length`, and the contents of `arrs` remain unchanged.
