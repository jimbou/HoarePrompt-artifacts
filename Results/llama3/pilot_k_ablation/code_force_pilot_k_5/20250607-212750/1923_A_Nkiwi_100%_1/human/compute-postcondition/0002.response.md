Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, as one test case is processed by the code. The first line of the code assigns the value of the first line of the test case to `length`, which is an integer. The second line assigns the list of integers from the second line of the test case to `arrs`. The third and fourth lines assign 0 and `length - 1` to `sIdx` and `eIdx`, respectively.
