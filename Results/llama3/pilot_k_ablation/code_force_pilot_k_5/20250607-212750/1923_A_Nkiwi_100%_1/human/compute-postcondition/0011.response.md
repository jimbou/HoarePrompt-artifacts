The variables in the loop head are sIdx and arrs, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables sIdx and arrs. If sIdx is less than length and arrs[sIdx] is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, sIdx is 4, length is greater than 3, and arrs[sIdx] is either 0 or 1. Since arrs[sIdx] is either 0 or 1, it needs to be adjusted to arrs[sIdx] is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first three elements being 0, sIdx is 4, eIdx is length - 1, length is greater than 3, arrs[sIdx] is 0**
