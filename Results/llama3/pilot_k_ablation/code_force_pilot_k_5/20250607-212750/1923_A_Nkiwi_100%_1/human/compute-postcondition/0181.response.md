The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not specified, `t` is not specified. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1.
State: **`sIdx` is increased by the number of leading zeros in `arrs`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to length, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is equal to 0, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[eIdx]` is equal to 0, `i` is `eIdx`, `cnt0` is updated accordingly based on the values of `arrs[sIdx + 1]` and `arrs[i]`. If `arrs[i]` is 0, `cnt0` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the values of `sIdx`, `eIdx`, `i`, and `cnt0` remain unchanged., `_` is increased by 1, `t` must be greater than `_`**
