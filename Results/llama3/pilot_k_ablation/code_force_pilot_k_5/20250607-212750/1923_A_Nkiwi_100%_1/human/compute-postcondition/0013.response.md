Output State: `t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first k elements being 0, sIdx is k, eIdx is length - 1, length is greater than or equal to k, arrs[sIdx] is 1.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop will continue to increment `sIdx` as long as the current element in `arrs` is 0. Once it encounters a 1, the loop will terminate. Therefore, the final state will have `sIdx` pointing to the first 1 in the array, or if all elements are 0, `sIdx` will be equal to `length`. The other variables remain unchanged.
