Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first three elements being 0, `sIdx` is 3, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is undefined**

In this output state, the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `sIdx` being 3. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
