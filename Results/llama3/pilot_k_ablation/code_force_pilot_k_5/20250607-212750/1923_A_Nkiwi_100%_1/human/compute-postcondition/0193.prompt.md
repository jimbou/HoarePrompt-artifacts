Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: length is an integer, arrs is a list of integers, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1, _ is increased by 1, t is greater than _, sIdx is less than or equal to length, eIdx is greater than or equal to sIdx, arrs[sIdx-1] is not defined, arrs[eIdx] is not defined, i is not defined, cnt0 is not defined.
Code of the loop:
while sIdx < length and arrs[sIdx] == 0:
    sIdx += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `length` is greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 1, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx]` is an integer, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `length` is greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 2, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx]` is not defined, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `length` is greater than 2, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 3, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `length` is greater than 3, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 4, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `length` is greater than 4, `arrs` is a list of integers, `sIdx` is 5, `eIdx` is `length` - 1, `_` is increased by 1, `t` is greater than `_`, `sIdx` is less than or equal to `length`, `eIdx` is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `arrs[sIdx-1]` is 0, `i` is not defined, `cnt0` is not defined, `arrs[sIdx]` is 0


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
