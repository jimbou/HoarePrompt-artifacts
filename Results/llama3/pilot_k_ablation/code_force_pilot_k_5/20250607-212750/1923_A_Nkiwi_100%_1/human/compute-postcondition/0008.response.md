Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers. Each integer in the list is either 0 or 1, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers with the first three elements being 0, sIdx is 3, eIdx is length - 1**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `sIdx` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases, each consisting of two lines: the first line contains an integer n, and the second line contains a space-separated list of n integers, where each integer is either 0 or 1. The length of the list is still an integer, and the list `arrs` still has a length of integers with the first three elements being 0. The value of `eIdx` is still `length - 1`.
