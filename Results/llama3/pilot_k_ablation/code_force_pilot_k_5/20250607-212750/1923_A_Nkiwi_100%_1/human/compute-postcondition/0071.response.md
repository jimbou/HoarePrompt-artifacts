Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is 0**

In this output state, all the variables from the initial state remain unchanged, except for `cnt0`, which is now defined and initialized to 0. The other variables still hold their original values and properties, such as `t` being at least 2, `length` being greater than 0, `arrs` being a list of `length` integers, and `sIdx` and `eIdx` being the indices of the first and last non-zero elements in `arrs`, respectively. Additionally, `i` is still equal to `length`.
