To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least `sIdx + 1`, and `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 1`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is the number of integers in the input, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the last element being 0 and at least one more element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is at least `sIdx + 1`, `i` is at least `sIdx + 2`. If the current value of `arrs[i]` is 0, then `cnt0` is 2, otherwise `cnt0` is 1.**
