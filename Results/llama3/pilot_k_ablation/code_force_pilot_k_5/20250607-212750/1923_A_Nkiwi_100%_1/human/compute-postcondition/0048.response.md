Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 2, length is an integer, arrs is a list of length integers, sIdx is 0, eIdx is length - 1, i is length, cnt0 is not defined**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `length` is updated to the integer value provided as input. The list `arrs` is updated to contain `length` integers, which are provided as input. The variables `sIdx` and `eIdx` are reset to 0 and `length - 1`, respectively, as per the code. The variable `i` is updated to `length + 1`, and `cnt0` is no longer defined as it is not updated or used in the code.
