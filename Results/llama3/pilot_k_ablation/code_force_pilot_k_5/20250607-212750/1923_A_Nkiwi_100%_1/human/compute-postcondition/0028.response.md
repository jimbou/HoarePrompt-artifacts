To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `sIdx`, and `eIdx`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `sIdx` is less than or equal to `eIdx`. Since `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, we can infer that `arrs` must have at least one non-zero element for the loop to execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be equal to `sIdx`.

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 1, `length` is an integer, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers that must have at least one non-zero element, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and is greater than or equal to `sIdx`, `cnt0` is 0, `i` is equal to `sIdx`, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**
