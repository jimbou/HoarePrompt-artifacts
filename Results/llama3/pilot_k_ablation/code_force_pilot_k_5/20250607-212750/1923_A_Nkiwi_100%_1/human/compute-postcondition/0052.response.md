Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 1, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers with the first two elements being 0, `sIdx` is 2, `eIdx` is `length - 1`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**

The code increments the value of `sIdx` by 1, so its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arrs` still has `length` integers, with the first two elements being 0. The value of `t` is still at least 2, and `length` is still greater than 1. The value of `eIdx` is still `length - 1`, and `i` is still equal to `length`. The variable `cnt0` is still not defined.
