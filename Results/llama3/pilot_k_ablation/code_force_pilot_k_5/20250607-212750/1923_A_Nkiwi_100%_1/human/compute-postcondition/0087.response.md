Output State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs` plus 1, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is greater than `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 2, `cnt0` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `cnt0` has been increased by 1, regardless of the value of `arrs[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
