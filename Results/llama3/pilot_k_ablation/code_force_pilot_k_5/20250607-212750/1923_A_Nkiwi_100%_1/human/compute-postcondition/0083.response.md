To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `sIdx`, `eIdx`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `eIdx + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `eIdx + 2`, which is greater than `eIdx + 1`, so the loop will not execute again. However, we need to adjust the states to make the loop execute again.

To make the loop execute again, `i` must be less than `eIdx + 1`. Since `i` is `eIdx + 2`, we need to decrease `i` by 1 to make it `eIdx + 1`. This means that `eIdx` must be increased by 1 to make `i` less than `eIdx + 1`.

Additionally, since `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs`, increasing `eIdx` by 1 means that the last non-zero element in `arrs` is now at index `eIdx + 1`.

The state of `sIdx` remains the same, as it is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, which has not changed.

The state of `t`, `length`, `arrs`, and `cnt0` remains the same, as they are not affected by the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of `length` integers, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is the index of the last non-zero element in `arrs` and `eIdx` is greater than `sIdx`, `i` is `eIdx + 1**
