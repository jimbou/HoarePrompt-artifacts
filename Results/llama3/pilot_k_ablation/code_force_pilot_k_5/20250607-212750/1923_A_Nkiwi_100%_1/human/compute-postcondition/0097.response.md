Output State: **t is an integer that must be at least 1, length is the number of integers in the input, arrs is a list of length integers with the first two elements being 0, sIdx is 2, eIdx is length - 1, i is length, cnt0 is undefined**

In this output state, the value of sIdx has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
