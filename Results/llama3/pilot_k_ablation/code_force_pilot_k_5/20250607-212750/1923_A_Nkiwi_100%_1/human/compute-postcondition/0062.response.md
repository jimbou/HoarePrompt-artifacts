According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `eIdx` and `arrs`. If `eIdx` is greater than or equal to 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `eIdx` is `length - 2`, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined, `t` is an integer that must be at least 2. `eIdx` being `length - 2` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `eIdx` is greater than 0. `arrs[eIdx]` being 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `arrs[eIdx]` is 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is an integer that must be at least 2, `length` is an integer greater than 0, `arrs` is a list of length integers with the last element being 0 and `arrs[eIdx]` is 0, `sIdx` is the index of the first non-zero element in `arrs`, `eIdx` is greater than 0, `i` is `length`, `cnt0` is not defined**
