Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of operations required to move the chips into a single block without any free cells between them. Here's why:

1. The program first finds the start and end indices of the first and last chips in the array by iterating from the beginning and end of the array, respectively, until it finds a non-zero element.

2. Then, it counts the number of zeros between these two indices, which represents the number of operations required to move the chips into a single block.

3. The program correctly handles the case where there are no chips in the array (i.e., all elements are zero) by not attempting to access any elements outside the bounds of the array.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where there is only one chip in the array, in which case the number of operations is zero.

5. The program correctly handles the case where there are multiple blocks of chips, in which case the number of operations is the sum of the number of zeros between each pair of adjacent blocks.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
