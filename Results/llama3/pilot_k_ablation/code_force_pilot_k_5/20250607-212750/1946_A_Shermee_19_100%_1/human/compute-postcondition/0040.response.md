To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `median_index` and `a[median_index]`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `median_index` is less than `n` and `a[median_index]` is equal to `median_value`.

At the end of the last iteration, `median_index` is equal to the previous `median_index` plus 1, and `a[median_index]` is equal to `median_value`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `median_index` to be less than `n` and `a[median_index]` to be equal to `median_value`.

Since `a` is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to `median_value` at the next index, we can adjust `median_index` to be equal to the previous `median_index` plus 1, and `a[median_index]` to be equal to `median_value`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, `a` is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to `median_value` at the next index, `median_index` is equal to the previous `median_index` plus 1 and less than `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to 4, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to 1 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to 2 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to 3 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to 4**
