Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the median value in a, median_value is the median value of a, operations is 0**

In this output state, the initial state of `test_cases` and `results` remains unchanged. The variable `case` is still the first test case in the list. The code extracts the first element `n` and the second element `a` from the first test case. The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The `median_index` is calculated as the index of the median value in the sorted list `a`, and the `median_value` is the actual median value of `a`. The variable `operations` is initialized to 0.
