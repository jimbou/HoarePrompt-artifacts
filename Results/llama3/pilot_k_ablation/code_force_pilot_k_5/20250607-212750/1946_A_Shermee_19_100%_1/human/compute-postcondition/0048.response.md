Output State: **n is the number of elements in the fourth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus one, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 1, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed**

The code increments the `median_index` by 1 and the `operations` by 1. The `median_index` was initially the index of the median element in the sorted list, so it now points to the next element in the list. The `operations` was initially 0, so it now becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
