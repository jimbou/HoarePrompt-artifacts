To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases` list. If the list has at least 4 test cases, the loop can execute again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 test cases, and `case` must be the fourth test case in the list.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 4 test cases, `case` is the fourth test case in the list, `n` is unknown, `a` is unknown, `median_index` is unknown, `median_value` is unknown, `operations` is unknown, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to the number of times the loop executed**
