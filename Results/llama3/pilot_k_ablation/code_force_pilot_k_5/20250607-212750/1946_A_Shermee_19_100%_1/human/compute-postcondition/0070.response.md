Output State: **n is greater than the current value of median_index plus 1, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case such that a[median_index + 1] is equal to median_value, median_index is four more than its original value, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 5, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed**

The code increments `median_index` by 1 and `operations` by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than the current value of `median_index` plus 1. The sorted list `a` and the value of `median_value` remain unchanged. The list `results` also remains unchanged.
