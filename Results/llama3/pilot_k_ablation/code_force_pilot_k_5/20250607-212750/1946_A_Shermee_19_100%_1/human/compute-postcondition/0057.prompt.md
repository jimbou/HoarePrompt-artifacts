Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the number of elements in the fourth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 0, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed
Code of the loop:
while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
    median_index += 1
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is the number of elements in the fourth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus one, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 1, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is the number of elements in the fourth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case with at least one more element with the same value as the median element, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus two, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 2, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is at least median_index + 1, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case with at least one more element with the same value as the median element, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus three, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 3, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: n is at least the index of the median element in the sorted list plus five, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case with at least two more elements with the same value as the median element, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus four, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 4, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: n is at least the index of the median element in the sorted list plus five, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case with at least three more elements with the same value as the median element, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus five, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 5, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
