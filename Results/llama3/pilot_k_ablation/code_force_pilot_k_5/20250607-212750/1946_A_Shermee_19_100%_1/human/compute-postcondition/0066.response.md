Output State: **n is the number of elements in the fifth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case such that a[median_index] is equal to median_value, median_index is less than n and is two more than its original value, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 3, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed**

In this output state, the value of `median_index` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `operations` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
