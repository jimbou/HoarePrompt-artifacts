Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index + 3, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is less than n, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index + 2 - the index of the median value in a, median_index is increased by 1, and operations is increased by 1.**

The code increments `median_index` by 1 and `operations` by 1. The value of `median_index` is now one more than its original value, and the value of `operations` is now one more than its original value. No other variables are affected.
