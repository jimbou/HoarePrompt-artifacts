Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and is greater than or equal to median_index, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than median_value, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a.**

This output state means that the loop has executed until median_index is no longer less than n and a[median_index] is not equal to median_value. At this point, median_index points to the first element in a that is greater than median_value, and operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed, which is the difference between the final value of median_index and the index of the median value in a.
