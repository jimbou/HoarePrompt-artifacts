Output State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is equal to n, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executes, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations after each iteration.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the median_index has reached the end of the list 'a', the number of operations is equal to the number of times the loop executes, and the list 'results' contains the value of operations after each iteration. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
