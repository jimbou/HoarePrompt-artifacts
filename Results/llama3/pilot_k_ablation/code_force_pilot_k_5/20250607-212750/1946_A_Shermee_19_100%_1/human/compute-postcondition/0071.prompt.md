Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is the number of elements in the fifth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus the number of times the loop executed, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 0, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed
Code of the loop:
while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
    median_index += 1
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is the number of elements in the fifth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus 1, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, a[median_index] is not necessarily equal to median_value, operations is 1, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: n is the number of elements in the fifth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case, median_index is less than n and is one more than its original value, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, a[median_index] is not necessarily equal to median_value, operations is 2, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: n is the number of elements in the fifth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case such that a[median_index] is equal to median_value, median_index is less than n and is two more than its original value, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 3, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: n is greater than the current value of median_index, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case such that a[median_index] is equal to median_value and a has at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is less than n and is three more than its original value, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 4, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: n is greater than the current value of median_index plus 1, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case such that a[median_index + 1] is equal to median_value, median_index is four more than its original value, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 5, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
