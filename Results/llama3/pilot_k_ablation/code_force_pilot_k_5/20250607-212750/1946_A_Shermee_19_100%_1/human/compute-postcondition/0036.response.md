To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `median_index` and `n`, as well as the condition `a[median_index] == median_value`.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `median_index` is less than `n` and `a[median_index]` is equal to `median_value`. At the end of the last iteration, `median_index` is equal to `((n - 1) // 2) + 2`, which is less than `n` since `n` is greater than `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`. However, we need to ensure that `a[median_index]` is still equal to `median_value`.

Since `a` is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to `median_value` after `median_index`, we can adjust the state of `a` to have at least one more element equal to `median_value` at the next index.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, `a` is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to `median_value` at the next index, `median_index` is equal to ((n - 1) // 2) + 2, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to 2, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to 1 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to 2**
