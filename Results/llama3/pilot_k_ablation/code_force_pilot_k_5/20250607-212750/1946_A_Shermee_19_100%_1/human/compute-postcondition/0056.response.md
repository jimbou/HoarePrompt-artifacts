Output State: **n is at least the index of the median element in the sorted list plus five, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case with at least three more elements with the same value as the median element, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus five, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 5, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed**

The code increments `median_index` by 1, making it the index of the median element in the sorted list plus five. It also increments `operations` by 1, making it 5. The other variables remain unchanged.
