Output State: **n is at least median_index + 1, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case with at least one more element with the same value as the median element, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus three, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 3, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed**

The code modifies the values of `median_index` and `operations`. The first line increments `median_index` by 1, making it the index of the median element in the sorted list plus three. The second line increments `operations` by 1, making it 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
