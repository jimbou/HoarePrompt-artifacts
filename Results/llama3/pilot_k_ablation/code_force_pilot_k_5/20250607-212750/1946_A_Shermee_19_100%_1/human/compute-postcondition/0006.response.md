Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and is greater than 0, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order with the element at median_index equal to median_value, median_index is the index of the median value in a plus two, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is 2**

The code increments the median_index by 1 and operations by 1. The median_index was the index of the median value in a plus one, so now it is the index of the median value in a plus two. The operations were 1, so now they are 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
