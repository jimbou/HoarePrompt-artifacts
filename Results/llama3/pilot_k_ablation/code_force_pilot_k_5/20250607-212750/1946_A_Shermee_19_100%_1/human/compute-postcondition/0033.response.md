Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is equal to ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 1, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 1.**

The code increments `median_index` by 1 and `operations` by 1. The value of `median_index` becomes `((n - 1) // 2) + 1`, and the value of `operations` becomes 1. The list `results` now contains two values: the original value of `operations` (0) and the newly appended value of `operations` (1). All other variables remain unchanged.
