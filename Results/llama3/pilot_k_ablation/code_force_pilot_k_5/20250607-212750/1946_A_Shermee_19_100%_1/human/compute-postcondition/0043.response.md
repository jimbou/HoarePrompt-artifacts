Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is equal to n, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to the number of times the loop executed.**

The loop will continue to execute as long as median_index is less than n and a[median_index] is equal to median_value. After each iteration, median_index is incremented by 1 and operations is incremented by 1. The loop will stop when median_index is equal to n or a[median_index] is not equal to median_value. Therefore, the final output state will have median_index equal to n, operations equal to the number of times the loop executed, and results will contain the initial value of operations (0) and the final value of operations.
