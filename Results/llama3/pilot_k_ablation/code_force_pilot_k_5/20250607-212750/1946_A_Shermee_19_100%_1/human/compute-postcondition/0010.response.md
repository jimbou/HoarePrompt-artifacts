Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and is greater than median_index, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order with the element at median_index equal to median_value, median_index is the index of the median value in a plus five, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is 4**

The code snippet modifies the values of `median_index` and `operations`. The first line increments `median_index` by 1, making it the index of the median value in `a` plus five. The second line increments `operations` by 1, making it equal to 4. All other variables remain unchanged.
