Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `results` is an empty list.**

In this output state, the code has created a new empty list called `results` and the `test_cases` variable remains unchanged, still containing a list of test cases with an integer n and a list of n integers.
