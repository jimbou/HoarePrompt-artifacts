Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to median_value at the next index, median_index is equal to the previous median_index plus 1 and less than n, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 5, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 1 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 2 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 3 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 4 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 5**

The code increments `median_index` by 1, making it one more than its previous value and still less than `n`. It also increments `operations` by 1, making it equal to 5. The `results` list now contains the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. All other variables remain unchanged.
