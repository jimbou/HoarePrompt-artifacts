Output State: **n is the number of elements in the fourth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus the number of times the loop executed, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is the number of times the loop executed, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, except for the values of the variables in the loop head and body. The number of elements in the fourth test case, the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case, and the value of the median element in the sorted list remain unchanged. The index of the median element in the sorted list is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, and the number of operations is equal to the number of times the loop executed. The results list contains the initial value of 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.
