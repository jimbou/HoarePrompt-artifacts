According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `median_index` and `a`. If `median_index` is less than `n` and `a[median_index]` is equal to `median_value`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `median_index` is increased by 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `median_index + 3`, `a` is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to `median_value` after the current `median_index`, and `median_value` is the median value of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `median_index` must be less than `n`, and `a[median_index]` must be equal to `median_value`. Since `median_index` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `median_index + 4` to ensure that `median_index` is less than `n`. Also, since `a` is sorted in ascending order, if there is at least one more element equal to `median_value` after the current `median_index`, then `a[median_index]` will be equal to `median_value`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` and `a`.

State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `results` is a list containing the value of operations, `case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to `median_index + 4`, `a` is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to `median_value` after the current `median_index`, `median_index` is less than `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, and `operations` is equal to `median_index + 2 - the index of the median value in `a`, `median_index` is increased by 1, and `operations` is increased by 1**
