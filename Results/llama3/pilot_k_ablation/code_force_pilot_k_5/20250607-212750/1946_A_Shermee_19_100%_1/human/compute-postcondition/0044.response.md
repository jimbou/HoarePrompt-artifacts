Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `a` is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to the number of times the loop executed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list of test cases, the third test case, the first element of the third test case, the second element of the third test case, the median index, and the median value remain unchanged. The number of operations is still equal to the number of times the loop executed. The list of results now contains two values: the initial value of operations (0) and the newly appended value of operations, which is equal to the number of times the loop executed.
