Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is greater than median_index plus two, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is the index of the median value in a plus six, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is 5**

In this output state, the value of `median_index` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `operations` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The list `test_cases` still contains at least one test case, `results` is still an empty list, `case` is still the first test case in the list, `n` is still greater than `median_index` plus one, `a` is still the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to `median_value` after the current `median_index`, and `median_value` is still the median value of `a`.
