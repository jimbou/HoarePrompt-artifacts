Output State: **n is at least the index of the median element in the sorted list plus five, a is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case with at least two more elements with the same value as the median element, median_index is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus four, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, operations is 4, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.**

The code modifies the values of `median_index` and `operations`. The first line increments `median_index` by 1, making it the index of the median element in the sorted list plus four. The second line increments `operations` by 1, making it 4. No other variables are affected.
