You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, a = case
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
            median_index += 1
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 5 test cases, case is the last test case in the list, n is the first element of the last test case and is greater than or equal to median_index, a is the second element of the last test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than median_value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a, and results is a list containing the value of operations for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of values, where each value represents the difference between the index of the first element in the second element of a test case that is greater than the median value of the second element, and the index of the median value in the second element, for each test case in the list of test cases.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns a list of values, where each value represents the difference between the index of the first element in the second element of a test case that is greater than the median value of the second element, and the index of the median value in the second element, for each test case in the list of test cases.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
