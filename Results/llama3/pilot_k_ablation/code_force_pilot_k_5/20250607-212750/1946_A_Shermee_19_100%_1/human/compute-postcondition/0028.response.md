Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is equal to n, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to n - the index of the median value in a.**

The loop will continue to execute until median_index is no longer less than n and a[median_index] is no longer equal to median_value. At this point, median_index will be equal to n, and operations will be equal to n - the index of the median value in a. The state of the other variables will remain unchanged.
