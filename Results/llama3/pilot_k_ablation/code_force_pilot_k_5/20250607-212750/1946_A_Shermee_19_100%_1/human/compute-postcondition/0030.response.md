The only variable in the loop head is variable  case and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the test_cases.  If the list has at least 3 test cases the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, test_cases has at least 2 test cases, case is the second test case in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 test cases and the case is the third test case in the list.
State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `a` is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to `n` - the index of the median value in `a`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to `n` - the index of the median value in `a`.**
