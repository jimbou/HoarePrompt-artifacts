Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is equal to (n - 1) // 2, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 0, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 0.**

In this output state, the list `test_cases` remains unchanged, still containing at least 3 test cases. The variable `case` also remains unchanged, still referring to the third test case in the list. The variables `n` and `a` are still the first and second elements of the third test case, respectively. However, the list `a` is now sorted in ascending order due to the execution of the code. The variable `median_index` is now equal to `(n - 1) // 2`, which is the index of the median value in the sorted list `a`. The variable `median_value` is now equal to the median value of `a`, which is the value at the index `median_index` in the sorted list `a`. The variable `operations` is now equal to 0, as assigned by the code. Finally, the list `results` contains the value of `operations`, which is 0, and the newly appended value of `operations`, which is also 0.
