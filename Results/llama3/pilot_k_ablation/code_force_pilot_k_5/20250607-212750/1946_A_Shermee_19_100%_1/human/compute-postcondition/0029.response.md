Output State: **`test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case, `a` is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to `n` - the index of the median value in `a`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to `n` - the index of the median value in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables maintain their initial state, but the list `results` is updated by appending the value of `operations`, which is equal to `n` minus the index of the median value in the sorted list `a`.
