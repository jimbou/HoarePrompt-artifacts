Output State: **n is the number of elements in the fifth test case, a is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case, median_index is less than n and is one more than its original value, median_value is the value of the median element in the sorted list, a[median_index] is not necessarily equal to median_value, operations is 2, results is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.**

In this final state, the value of `median_index` has increased by 1, and the value of `operations` has also increased by 1. The relationship between `median_index` and `median_value` is no longer guaranteed, as `median_index` has changed. All other variables remain unchanged.
