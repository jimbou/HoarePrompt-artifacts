Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and is greater than 0, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order with the element at median_index equal to median_value, median_index is the index of the median value in a plus four, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is 3**

The code modifies the values of `median_index` and `operations`. The first line increments `median_index` by 1, making it the index of the median value in `a` plus four. The second line increments `operations` by 1, making it equal to 3. No other variables are affected.
