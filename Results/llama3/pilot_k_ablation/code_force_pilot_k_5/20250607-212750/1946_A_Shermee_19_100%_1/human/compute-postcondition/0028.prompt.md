Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than median_value, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a
Code of the loop:
while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
    median_index += 1
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index + 1, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is equal to median_value and is less than n, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index + 1 - the index of the median value in a
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index + 3, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is equal to median_value and is less than n, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index + 2 - the index of the median value in a
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index + 3, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is less than n, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index + 2 - the index of the median value in a, median_index is increased by 1, and operations is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index + 4, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is increased by 1, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is increased by 1 and is equal to median_index + 2 - the index of the median value in a.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index + 5, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is increased by 1, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is increased by 1 and is equal to median_index + 2 - the index of the median value in a


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
