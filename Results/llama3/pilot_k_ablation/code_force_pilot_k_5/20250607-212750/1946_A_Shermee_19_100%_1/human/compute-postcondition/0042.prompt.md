Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is equal to (n - 1) // 2, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 0, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 0.
Code of the loop:
while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
    median_index += 1
    operations += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is equal to ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 1, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to median_value after median_index, median_index is equal to ((n - 1) // 2) + 2, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 2, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 1 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 2
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to median_value at the next index, median_index is equal to ((n - 1) // 2) + 3, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 3, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 1 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 2 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 3.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to median_value at the next index, median_index is equal to the previous median_index plus 1, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 4, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 1 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 2 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 3 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 4
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, case is the third test case in the list, n is the first element of the third test case and must be greater than ((n - 1) // 2) + 1, a is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order and has at least one more element equal to median_value at the next index, median_index is equal to the previous median_index plus 1 and less than n, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to 5, and results is a list containing the value of operations which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 1 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 2 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 3 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 4 and the newly appended value of operations which is equal to 5


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
