Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is an empty list, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and is greater than 0, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the median value in a plus one, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is 1**

The code increments the median_index by 1 and the operations by 1. The median_index was the index of the median value in a, so now it is the index of the median value in a plus one. The operations were 0, so now they are 1. No other variables are affected.
