Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `test_cases` is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9), `results` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for case in test_cases:
    n, a = case
    a.sort()
    median_index = (n - 1) // 2
    median_value = a[median_index]
    operations = 0
    while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
        median_index += 1
        operations += 1
    results.append(operations)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and is greater than or equal to median_index, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than median_value, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, `case` is the second test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the second test case, `a` is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to `n` - the index of the median value in `a`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to `n` - the index of the median value in `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `test_cases` is a list of test cases that must have at least 3 test cases, `case` is the third test case in the list, `n` is the first element of the third test case, `a` is the second element of the third test case and is sorted in ascending order, `median_index` is equal to `n`, `median_value` is the median value of `a`, `operations` is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` which is equal to 0 and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to the number of times the loop executed, and the newly appended value of `operations` which is equal to the number of times the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is the number of elements in the fourth test case, `a` is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case, `median_index` is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus the number of times the loop executed, `median_value` is the value of the median element in the sorted list, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed, `results` is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is the number of elements in the fifth test case, `a` is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case, `median_index` is the index of the first element in the sorted list that is greater than the `median_value`, `median_value` is the value of the median element in the sorted list, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed, `results` is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
