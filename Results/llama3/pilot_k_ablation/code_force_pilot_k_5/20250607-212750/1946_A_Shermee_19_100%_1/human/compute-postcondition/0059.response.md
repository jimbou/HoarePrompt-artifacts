To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `case` and `test_cases`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `test_cases`. If `test_cases` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `test_cases` has at least 4 elements (since `n` is the number of elements in the fourth test case), and `case` is the fourth test case.

For the loop to execute again, `test_cases` must have at least 5 elements, and `case` must be the fifth test case.

State: **`n` is the number of elements in the fifth test case, `a` is the sorted list of elements in the fifth test case, `median_index` is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus the number of times the loop executed, `median_value` is the value of the median element in the sorted list, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed, `results` is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed**
