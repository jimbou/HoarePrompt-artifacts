Output State: **The program returns a list of values, where each value represents the difference between the index of the first element in the second element of a test case that is greater than the median value of the second element, and the index of the median value in the second element, for each test case in the list of test cases.**

In this output state, the list contains the value of operations for each test case. The operations value for each test case is calculated as the difference between the index of the first element in the second element of the test case that is greater than the median value of the second element, and the index of the median value in the second element. The median value is the middle value of the second element when it is sorted in ascending order. The index of the median value is the position of the median value in the sorted second element. The median_index is the index of the first element in the second element that is greater than the median value. The operations value is calculated as median_index - the index of the median value in the second element.
