Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index + 4, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with at least one more element equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is increased by 1, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is increased by 1 and is equal to median_index + 2 - the index of the median value in a.**

In this final state, the value of `median_index` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `operations` has also been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
