Output State: **test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 1 test case, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the first test case in the list, n is the first element of the first test case and is greater than or equal to median_index, a is the second element of the first test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than median_value, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a.**

In this output state, the value of operations, which is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a, has been appended to the results list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
