Output State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 2 test cases, results is a list containing the value of operations, case is the second test case in the list, n is the first element of the second test case and is greater than or equal to median_index, a is the second element of the second test case and is sorted in ascending order with all elements equal to median_value after the current median_index, median_index is equal to n, median_value is the median value of a, and operations is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the median_index has reached the value of n, and all elements in the list a after the current median_index are equal to the median_value. The operations variable has been incremented to reflect the number of times the loop executed, which is equal to the difference between the median_index and the index of the median value in a.
