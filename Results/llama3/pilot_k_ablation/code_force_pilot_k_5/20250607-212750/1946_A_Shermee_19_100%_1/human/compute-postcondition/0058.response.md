Output State: **`n` is the number of elements in the fourth test case, `a` is the sorted list of elements in the fourth test case, `median_index` is the index of the median element in the sorted list plus the number of times the loop executed, `median_value` is the value of the median element in the sorted list, `operations` is the number of times the loop executed, `results` is a list containing 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed.**

The code appends the value of `operations` to the `results` list. Since `operations` is the number of times the loop executed, the `results` list now contains 0, the number of times the loop executed, the number of times the loop executed, and the number of times the loop executed. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
