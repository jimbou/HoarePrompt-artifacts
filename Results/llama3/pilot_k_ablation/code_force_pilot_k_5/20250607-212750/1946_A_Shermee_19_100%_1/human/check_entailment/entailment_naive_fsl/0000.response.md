Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is designed to find the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of an array. The program sorts the array, identifies the median index and value, and then counts the number of operations needed to increase the median by incrementing the values at the median index and beyond until a different value is encountered.

The program correctly handles various cases, including:

1.  When the array has an odd length, the median is the middle value.
2.  When the array has an even length, the median is the average of the two middle values.
3.  When there are duplicate values at the median index, the program correctly counts the number of operations needed to increase the median.

The program's logic is sound, and it should produce the correct results for all possible inputs. The use of the `sort` method ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order, allowing the program to accurately identify the median index and value.

Overall, the program is well-structured, and its logic is easy to follow. It correctly implements the required functionality, making it a correct solution to the problem.
