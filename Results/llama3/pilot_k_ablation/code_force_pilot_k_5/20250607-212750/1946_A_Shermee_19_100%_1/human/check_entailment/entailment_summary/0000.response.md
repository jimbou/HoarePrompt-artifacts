Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. 

Here's why:

1. The program first sorts the array in ascending order. This is necessary to find the median of the array.

2. It then finds the median index and value. The median index is calculated as (n - 1) // 2, where n is the length of the array. This is correct because Python uses zero-based indexing.

3. The program then counts the number of elements equal to the median value. This is done by incrementing the median index until an element greater than the median value is found. The count of elements equal to the median value is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

4. The program repeats this process for each test case and returns a list of results.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
