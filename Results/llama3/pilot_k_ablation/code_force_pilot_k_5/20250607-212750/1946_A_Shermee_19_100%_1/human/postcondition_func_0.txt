This function calculates the difference between the index of the first element greater than the median value and the index of the median value for each test case in a list of test cases. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer n and a list of n integers, and returns a list of values representing these differences. The function sorts the list of integers in each test case, finds the median value, and then counts the number of elements equal to the median value. The result for each test case is the count of these elements.
