#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_cases is a list of test cases, where each test case is a list containing an integer n (1 <= n <= 10^5) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 <= a_i <= 10^9).
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        n, a = case
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median_value = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        while median_index < n and a[median_index] == median_value:
            median_index += 1
            operations += 1
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State: test_cases is a list of test cases that must have at least 5 test cases, case is the last test case in the list, n is the first element of the last test case and is greater than or equal to median_index, a is the second element of the last test case and is sorted in ascending order, median_index is the index of the first element in a that is greater than median_value, median_value is the median value of a, operations is equal to median_index - the index of the median value in a, and results is a list containing the value of operations for each test case.
    return results
    #The program returns a list of values, where each value represents the difference between the index of the first element in the second element of a test case that is greater than the median value of the second element, and the index of the median value in the second element, for each test case in the list of test cases.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the difference between the index of the first element greater than the median value and the index of the median value for each test case in a list of test cases. It accepts a list of test cases, where each test case contains an integer n and a list of n integers, and returns a list of values representing these differences. The function sorts the list of integers in each test case, finds the median value, and then counts the number of elements equal to the median value. The result for each test case is the count of these elements.
