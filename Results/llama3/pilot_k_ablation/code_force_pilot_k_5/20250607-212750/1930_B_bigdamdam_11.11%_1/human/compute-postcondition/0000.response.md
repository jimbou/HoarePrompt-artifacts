To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `input()`. The loop will execute if `input()` returns a value that can be converted to an integer and is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains at least one line of input, the first line of stdin contains a single integer t that is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
