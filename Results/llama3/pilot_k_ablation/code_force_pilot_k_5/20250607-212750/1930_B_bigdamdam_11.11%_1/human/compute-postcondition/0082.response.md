The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 2 and `p` is an empty list, `p` will become a list containing the single element 2.

The values of `a` and the contents of stdin are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `p` is a list containing the single element 2, stdin contains at least 1 more line of input**
