The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 8, the list `p` now contains the integers 2, 4, 6, and 8.

The value of `a` is not affected by this code, so it remains an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin and is at least 9.

The value of `i` is also not affected by this code, so it remains 8.

The stdin is not affected by this code, so it still contains at least one line of input minus the first line.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin and is at least 9, `i` is 8, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, and 8, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line.**
