The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 7, `a` is at least 7. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `i` is 9, and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 9.
State: **`a` is at least 10, `i` is 9, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, plus the integers 1, 3, 5, and 7, `stdin` contains at least one line of input**
