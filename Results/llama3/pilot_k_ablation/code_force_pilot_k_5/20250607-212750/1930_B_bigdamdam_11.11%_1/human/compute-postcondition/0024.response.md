Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `a`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, followed by all odd integers from 1 to `a` inclusive, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `a` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is equal to `a`, the list `p` contains all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, followed by all odd integers from 1 to `a` inclusive, and the state of stdin remains unchanged.
