The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the end of the list `p`. Since `i` is 1, the list `p` now contains the integers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 1. The values of `a` and `i` are not affected. The stdin still contains at least 1 more line of input.

Output State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 1, stdin contains at least 1 more line of input**
