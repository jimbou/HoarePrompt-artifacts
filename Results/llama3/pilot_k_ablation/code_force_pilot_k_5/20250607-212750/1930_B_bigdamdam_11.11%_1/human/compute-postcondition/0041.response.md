The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the end of the list `p`. Since `i` is 1, the list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, plus the integer 1.

Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, plus the integer 1, `stdin` contains at least one line of input**
