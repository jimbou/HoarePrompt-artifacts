Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 5, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, followed by the integer 1, the integer 3 and the integer 5, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the end of the list `p`. Since `i` is 5, the list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, followed by the integer 1, the integer 3, and the integer 5. The values of `a` and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least one line of input minus the first line.
