The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step is 2), so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 3.
State: **`a` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and 1, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input**
