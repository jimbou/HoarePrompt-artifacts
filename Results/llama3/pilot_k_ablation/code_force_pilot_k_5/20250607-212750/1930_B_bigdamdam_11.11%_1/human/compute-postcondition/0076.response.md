Output State: **`a` is unchanged, `i` is `a - 1` if `a` is odd and `a` if `a` is even, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `a` remains the same, the value of `i` is either `a - 1` if `a` is an odd number or `a` if `a` is an even number, the list `p` contains all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), and there is at least one line of input in `stdin`.
