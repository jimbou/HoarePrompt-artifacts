The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `a` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2) and `a` must be greater than the new value of `i`. So, `i` is 4 and `a` must be greater than 4.
State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin and is at least 5, `i` is 4, `p` is a list containing the integer 2, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line**
