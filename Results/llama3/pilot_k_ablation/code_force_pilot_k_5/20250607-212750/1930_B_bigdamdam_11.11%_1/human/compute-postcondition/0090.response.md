The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 10, the list `p` now contains the elements 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.

The values of the other variables are not affected. `a` is still greater than 10, and `stdin` still contains at least 1 more line of input.

Output State: **`a` is greater than 10, `i` is 10, `p` is a list containing the elements 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, `stdin` contains at least 1 more line of input.**
