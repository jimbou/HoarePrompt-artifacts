The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 4, the list `p` will now contain the integers 2 and 4. The values of `a` and stdin are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin and is at least 5, `i` is 4, `p` is a list containing the integers 2 and 4, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line.**
