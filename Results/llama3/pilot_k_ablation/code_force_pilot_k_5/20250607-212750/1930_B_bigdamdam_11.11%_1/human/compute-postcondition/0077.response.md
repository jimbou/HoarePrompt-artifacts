The `print(*p)` statement will print all elements in the list `p`.

Based on the precondition, the list `p` contains all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive).

Since the exact value of `a` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `p`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output all even numbers from 2 to `a` and all odd numbers from 1 to `a`.

Output: **all even numbers from 2 to a and all odd numbers from 1 to a (where a is the value of a)**
