The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 8, `a` is at least 9. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 10, and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 10.
State: **`a` is at least 11, `i` is 10, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, and 8, `stdin` contains at least one line of input.**
