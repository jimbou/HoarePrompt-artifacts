The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `a` is greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 7, and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 7.
State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 7, `i` is 7, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, followed by the integer 1, the integer 3 and the integer 5, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line.**
