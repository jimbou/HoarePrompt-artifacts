The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 2, the list `p` will now contain the element 2. The values of `a` and `stdin` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `p` is a list containing the element 2, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input**
