Functionality: **The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of subsequent integers to process. For each integer, it generates a list of numbers from 2 to the integer (inclusive), alternating between even and odd numbers, and prints this list. The function continues this process until all input integers have been processed, consuming all input lines.**
