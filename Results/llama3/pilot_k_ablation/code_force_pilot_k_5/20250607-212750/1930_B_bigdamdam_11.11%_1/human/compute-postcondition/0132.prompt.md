Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3). Each of the following t lines contains a single integer n (3 <= n <= 10^5).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    a = [int(i) for i in input().split()][0]
    p = []
    for i in range(2, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    for i in range(1, a + 1, 2):
        p += [i]
    print(*p)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `a`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, followed by all odd integers from 1 to `a` inclusive, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line, and the list `p` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is at least 2, `i` is `a`, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, plus all odd integers from 1 to `a` inclusive, `stdin` contains at least one line of input, and the list `p` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is unchanged, `i` is `a - 1` if `a` is odd and `a` if `a` is even, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input, and the list `p` containing all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `a` if `a` is odd, `a - 1` if `a` is even, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains at least 1 more line of input, and the list `p` containing all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `a` is an integer that must be at least 11, `i` is 11, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and stdin contains at least 1 more line of input, and this is printed: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
