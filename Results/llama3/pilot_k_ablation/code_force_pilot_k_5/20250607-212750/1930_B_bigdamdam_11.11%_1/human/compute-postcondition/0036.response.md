The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. The initial state is: `a` is at least 9, `i` is 8, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, and 6, `stdin` contains at least one line of input.

The value of `i` is 8, so the list `p` will be appended with 8. The new list `p` will be [2, 4, 6, 8]. The values of `a` and `stdin` are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is at least 9, `i` is 8, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, and 8, `stdin` contains at least one line of input.**
