The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a + 1` and `i` is even, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `a` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 2 so `i` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 5.
State: **`a` is greater than 5, `i` is 6, `p` is a list containing the elements 2 and 4, `stdin` contains at least 1 line of input**
