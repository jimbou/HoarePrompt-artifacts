To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2). 

State: **`a` is an integer equal to the first integer in the first line of stdin and is at least 2, `i` is 2, `p` is an empty list, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line**
