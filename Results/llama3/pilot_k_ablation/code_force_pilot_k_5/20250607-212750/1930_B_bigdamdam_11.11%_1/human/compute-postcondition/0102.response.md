Output State: **`a` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `a` if `a` is odd, `a - 1` if `a` is even, `p` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), stdin contains at least 1 more line of input.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `a` remains unchanged, the value of `i` is either `a` if `a` is an odd number or `a - 1` if `a` is an even number, the list `p` contains all even numbers from 2 to `a` (inclusive) and all odd numbers from 1 to `a` (inclusive), and there is still at least one more line of input in stdin.
