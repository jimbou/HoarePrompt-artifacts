The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 7, `a` is at least 7. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (because the step is 2), so `i` is 9 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 9.
State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 10, `i` is 9, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, and stdin contains at least 1 more line of input.**
