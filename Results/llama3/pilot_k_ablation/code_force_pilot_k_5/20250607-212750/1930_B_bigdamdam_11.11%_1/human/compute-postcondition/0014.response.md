The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the end of the list `p`. Since `i` is 1, the list `p` now contains all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, plus the integer 1 at the end.

The value of `a` is still an integer greater than or equal to 3, and the value of `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains at least one line of input minus the first line.

Output State: **`a` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 1, `p` is a list containing all even integers from 2 to `a` inclusive, followed by the integer 1, stdin contains at least one line of input minus the first line.**
