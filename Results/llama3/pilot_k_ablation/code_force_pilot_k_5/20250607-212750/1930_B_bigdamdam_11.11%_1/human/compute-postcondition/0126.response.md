Output State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 7, `i` is 7, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 1, 3, 5, 7, and stdin contains at least 1 more line of input.**

Explanation: The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` (which is 7) to the list `p`. The other variables `a` and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 more line of input.
