The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If a is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, a is an integer read from stdin does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `a` is at least 3 and i is now 2. 
State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `p` is an empty list, stdin contains at least 1 more line of input**
