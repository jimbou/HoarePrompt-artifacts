The code `p += [i]` appends the value of `i` to the list `p`. Since `i` is 8, the list `p` will now contain the integers 2, 4, 6, and 8.

The values of `a` and stdin are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 9, `i` is 8, `p` is a list containing the integers 2, 4, 6, and 8, stdin contains at least 1 more line of input**
