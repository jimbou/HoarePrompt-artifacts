To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2). Before the loop starts, `a` is an integer read from the input, but we don't know its value. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `a` to be at least 2.

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to 2, which is the starting value of the range.

The other variables, `p` and `stdin`, are not directly related to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust their states.

State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `p` is an empty list, `stdin` contains at least one line of input**
