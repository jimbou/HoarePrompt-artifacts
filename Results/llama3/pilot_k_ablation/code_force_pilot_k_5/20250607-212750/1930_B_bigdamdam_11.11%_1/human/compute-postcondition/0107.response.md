To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2). Also, `i` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 2.

State: **`a` is an integer that must be at least 2, `i` is 2, `p` is an empty list, stdin contains at least 1 more line of input**
