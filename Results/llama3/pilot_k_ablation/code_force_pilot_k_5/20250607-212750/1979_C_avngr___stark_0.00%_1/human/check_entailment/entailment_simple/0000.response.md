Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers `k_i` by multiplying all the multipliers together. This is because the LCM of a set of numbers is equal to the product of the numbers divided by their greatest common divisor (GCD).
2.  The program then calculates the GCD of the LCM divided by each multiplier `k_i`. This is done to find the smallest possible bet for each outcome that will result in a total payout greater than the total bet.
3.  The program checks if the sum of the bets is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, the program prints the bets for each outcome.
4.  The program uses the `gcd` function from the `math` module to calculate the GCD of two numbers. This function is correct and efficient.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it does so in an efficient and readable manner.

Correctness: **True**
