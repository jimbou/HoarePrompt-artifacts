Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to distribute coins among different outcomes in a game such that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program works by first calculating the least common multiple (LCM) of the multipliers for each outcome. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the LCM divided by each multiplier. The GCD is used to reduce the amounts bet on each outcome while ensuring that the total amount bet is still less than the number of coins received back for each winning outcome.

The program correctly handles the case where it is not possible to distribute the coins as required, in which case it outputs -1.

The execution summary shows that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of a list of integers, which is used in the main program to reduce the amounts bet on each outcome.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
