Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers `k_i`. This is done by multiplying all the `k_i` values together.

2. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the amount of coins to bet by dividing the LCM by the corresponding multiplier `k_i`. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

3. The program then calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the amounts of coins to bet. This is done by calling the `func_1` function, which correctly calculates the GCD of a list of integers.

4. The program then divides each amount of coins to bet by the GCD. This is done to minimize the total amount of coins bet while still ensuring that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

5. Finally, the program checks if the total amount of coins bet is greater than or equal to the LCM. If it is, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no way to distribute the coins as required. Otherwise, the program prints the amounts of coins to bet for each outcome.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine how to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome.

Correctness: **True**
