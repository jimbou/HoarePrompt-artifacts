Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the strategy to distribute the coins in such a way that you will come out ahead in the event of any winning outcome. The program first calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of all the multipliers, which is the smallest number that is a multiple of all the multipliers. Then, for each outcome, it calculates the bet as the LCM divided by the multiplier for that outcome. This ensures that the total amount of coins bet on all outcomes is strictly less than the number of coins received back for each possible winning outcome.

The program also correctly handles the case where there is no way to distribute the coins as required, in which case it outputs -1.

The use of the `gcd` function to calculate the highest common factor (HCF) of the bets is also correct, as it allows the program to simplify the bets by dividing them by their HCF.

Overall, the program correctly implements the strategy to solve the problem, and it handles all possible cases correctly.
