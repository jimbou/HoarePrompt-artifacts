#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers, where each integer is a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and all integers are between 2 and 20 (inclusive).
    hcf = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        hcf = gcd(hcf, num)
        
    #State: `numbers` is a list of integers with at least `len(numbers)` elements, `hcf` is equal to the gcd of all integers in the list `numbers`, and `num` is the last integer in the list `numbers`.
    return hcf
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all integers in the list `numbers`.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of integers, where each integer represents a multiplier for the amount of coins if the corresponding outcome turns out to be winning, and all integers are between 2 and 20 (inclusive). The function takes a list of integers as input and returns a single integer value representing the gcd of all integers in the list.
