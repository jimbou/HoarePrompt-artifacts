The only objects in the loop head are variables  num and list  numbers, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list numbers.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, numbers has at least 3 elements, num is the third integer in the list numbers. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the num is the fourth integer in the list numbers.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hcf` is equal to the gcd of the first three integers in the list `numbers`, `num` is the fourth integer in the list `numbers`.**
