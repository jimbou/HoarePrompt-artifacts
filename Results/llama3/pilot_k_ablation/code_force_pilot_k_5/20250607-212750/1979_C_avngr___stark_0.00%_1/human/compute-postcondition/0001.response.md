According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `numbers`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `hcf` is equal to the first integer in the list `numbers`. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 2 elements and the num is the second integer in the list.
State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hcf` is equal to the first integer in the list `numbers`, num is the second integer in the list**
