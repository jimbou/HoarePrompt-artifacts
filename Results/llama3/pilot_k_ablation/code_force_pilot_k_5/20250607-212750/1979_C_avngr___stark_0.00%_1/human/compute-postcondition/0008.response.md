To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The initial state mentions that `numbers` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `hcf` is equal to the gcd of the first four integers in the list `numbers`, and `num` is the fifth integer in the list `numbers`.

2. The code `hcf = gcd(hcf, num)` updates the value of `hcf` by calculating the gcd of the current `hcf` and `num`.

3. Since `hcf` was initially equal to the gcd of the first four integers in the list `numbers`, and `num` is the fifth integer in the list, the updated `hcf` will be the gcd of the first five integers in the list `numbers`.

4. The values of `numbers` and `num` remain unchanged, as the code only updates the value of `hcf`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `hcf` is equal to the gcd of the first five integers in the list `numbers`, and `num` is the fifth integer in the list `numbers`.**
