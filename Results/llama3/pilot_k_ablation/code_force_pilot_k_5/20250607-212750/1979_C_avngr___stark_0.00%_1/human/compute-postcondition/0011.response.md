Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers with at least `len(numbers)` elements, `hcf` is equal to the gcd of all integers in the list `numbers`, and `num` is the last integer in the list `numbers`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `numbers` will have at least as many elements as its original length, the variable `hcf` will hold the greatest common divisor of all the integers in the list `numbers`, and the variable `num` will hold the value of the last integer in the list `numbers`.
