Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `hcf` is equal to the gcd of the first three integers in the list `numbers`, `num` is the third integer in the list `numbers`.**

In this output state, the value of `hcf` has been updated to be the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the first three integers in the list `numbers`. The other variables, `numbers` and `num`, remain unchanged.
