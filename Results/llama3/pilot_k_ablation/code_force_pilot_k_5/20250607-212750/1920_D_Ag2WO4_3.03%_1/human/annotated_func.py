#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers where the first two integers represent the number of operations (n) and the number of queries (q), followed by n pairs of integers representing the operations, and finally q integers representing the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (f == 0) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the first element of the initial list of integers which is the number of operations (n).
    #State: *`x` is an integer, `x` is the first element of the initial list of integers which is the number of operations (n), and `f` is not equal to 0
    for i in range(f - 1, -1, -1):
        if a[2 * i] >= x:
            continue
        
        if a[2 * i + 1] < x:
            x %= a[2 * i + 1]
            if x == 0:
                return b[a[2 * i + 1]]
            if a[2 * i] >= x:
                continue
        
        return b[x]
        
    #State: `x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is -1.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function takes a list of integers and two additional parameters, f and b, as input. It first checks if f is 0, and if so, returns the value at index x in list b, where x is the first element of the initial list of integers representing the number of operations. If f is not 0, it iterates through the list of integers in reverse order, performing a series of conditional checks and modifications to the value of x. If certain conditions are met, it returns the value at index x in list b. If the loop completes without returning, the function's state is such that x is equal to the number of operations, f is greater than 0, and i is -1.
