Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the query k is equal to the length of the array a. In this case, the function func_1(x) will return an incorrect result because it does not handle this edge case properly.

For example, if the input is:

4
5 10
1 1
1 2
2 1
1 3
2 3
1 2 3 4 5 6 14 15 16 20

The program will output:

1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3

However, the correct output should be:

1 2 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 3 1

The last query 20 is equal to the length of the array a, and the program does not handle this case correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
