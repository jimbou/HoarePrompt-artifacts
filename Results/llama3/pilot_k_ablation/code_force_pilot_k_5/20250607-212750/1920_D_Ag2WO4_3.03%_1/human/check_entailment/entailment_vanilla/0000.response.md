Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of an array after a series of operations. The program uses a list `a` to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary `b` to store the elements of the array.

The program first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the number of operations `c` and the number of queries `d`. It then initializes the list `a` with two zeros and the dictionary `b` as an empty dictionary.

The program then reads the operations one by one. If the operation is of type 1 (append an integer), it increments the last element of `a` by 1 and stores the integer in `b` with the current index as the key. If the operation is of type 2 (append x copies of the array), it checks if the current size of the array is not equal to the previous size. If it is not equal, it appends the current size to `a`, multiplies it by `e + 1` (where `e` is the number of copies), and appends the result to `a`. It also increments the variable `f` by 1. If the current size is equal to the previous size, it simply multiplies the previous size by `e + 1` and updates the last element of `a`.

After reading all the operations, the program reads the queries one by one. For each query, it calls the function `func_1` with the query as an argument. The function `func_1` takes an integer `x` as input and returns the x-th element of the array.

The function `func_1` first checks if `f` is 0. If it is 0, it simply returns the value stored in `b` with the key `x`. If `f` is not 0, it iterates over the list `a` in reverse order. For each pair of elements in `a`, it checks if the first element is greater than or equal to `x`. If it is, it continues to the next pair. If the second element is less than `x`, it calculates the remainder of `x` divided by the second element and checks if the remainder is 0. If it is 0, it returns the value stored in `b` with the key equal to the second element. If the remainder is not 0, it checks if the first element is greater than or equal to the remainder. If it is, it continues to the next pair. If it is not, it returns the value stored in `b` with the key equal to the remainder.

Finally, the program prints the results of the queries separated by spaces.

Correctness: **True**
