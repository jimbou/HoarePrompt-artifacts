Reasoning: The program is correct. It correctly handles the two types of operations and queries. For operation type 1, it appends the integer x to the end of the array and stores the index and value in the dictionary b. For operation type 2, it appends x copies of the current array to the end of the array and updates the array size in the list a. For queries, it uses the list a and dictionary b to find the k-th element of the array. The program also handles the case where the array size exceeds 10^18.

Correctness: **True**
