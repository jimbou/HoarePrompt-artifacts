Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 4`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `x`, `n`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `continue` statement only skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one, without affecting the values of the variables.
