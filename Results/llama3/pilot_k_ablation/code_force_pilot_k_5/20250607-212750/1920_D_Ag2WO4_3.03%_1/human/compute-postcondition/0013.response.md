Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`. If the current value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`, we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, if `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `x`, then `x` is updated to `n % a[2 * (f - 1) + 1]`, the current value of `a[2 * i]` is less than `n`, the current value of `a[2 * i + 1]` is less than `n`, and `x` is not equal to 0. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
