Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 1`, and the current value of `a[2 * i]` is greater than or equal to `x`. We skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `x`, `n`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition `a[2 * i]` being greater than or equal to `x` is still valid. The only effect of the `continue` statement is that we skip to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
