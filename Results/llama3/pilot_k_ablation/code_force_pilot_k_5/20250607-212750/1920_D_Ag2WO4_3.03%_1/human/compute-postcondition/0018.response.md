Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 3`, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `x`, `n`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged because the `continue` statement does not affect their values. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration and move on to the next iteration.
