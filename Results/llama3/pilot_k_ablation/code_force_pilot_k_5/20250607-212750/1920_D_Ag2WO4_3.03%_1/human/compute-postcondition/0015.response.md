Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 2`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `x`, `n`, `f`, and `i` remain unchanged, as the `continue` statement only skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one. The relationship between `x` and `n` is still maintained, and `i` is still equal to `f - 2`. The loop continues to the next iteration, but the values of the variables are not affected by the `continue` statement.
