Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is -1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `x` remains unchanged and is still equal to the initial value of `n`. The value of `f` is still greater than 0, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `i` is -1, which is the final value of the loop counter after the loop has finished executing.
