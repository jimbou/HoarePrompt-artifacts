Output State: **`x` is an integer, `x` is equal to `n`, `f` is greater than 0, `i` is `f - 5`, and we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial values, and the only change is that we skip the rest of the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement.
