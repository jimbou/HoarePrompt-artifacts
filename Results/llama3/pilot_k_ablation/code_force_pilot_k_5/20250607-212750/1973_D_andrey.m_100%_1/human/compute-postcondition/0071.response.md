To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop's conditions.

The loop head is `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `n // k` down to 1, decrementing `i` by 1 each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n // k - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n // k - 2`.

The other variables in the loop head are `n` and `k`, but their values do not change based on the loop's conditions. `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, and `k` is still a positive integer greater than 0.

The other variables (`max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`) are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `p` is either 0 (if it was greater than or equal to `n`) or its original value (if it was less than `n`).**
