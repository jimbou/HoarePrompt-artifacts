To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `k`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1.

Before the loop starts, we know that `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, which already satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `j` to ensure it is within the range of the loop.

Since the loop starts from 1 and goes up to `k` (inclusive), we can set `j` to 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 3, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 1, and `p` is 0**
