To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved in it.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `k + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5.

The other variables in the loop head are `k`, which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. Since `k` is not modified within the loop, its value remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 5. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to `p`.**

Note that the values of `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not modified within the loop head, so their states remain the same.
