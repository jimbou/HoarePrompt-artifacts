Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, stdin is empty, _ is `t-1`, and a function named func_3 has been called and executed `t` times.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, the standard input remains empty, the loop variable `_` has reached the value of `t-1`, and the function `func_3` has been called and executed a total of `t` times.
