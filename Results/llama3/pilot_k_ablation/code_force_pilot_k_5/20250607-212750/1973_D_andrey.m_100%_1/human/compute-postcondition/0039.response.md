Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, i is n // k, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 4, p is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect in this context.

Therefore, the only change to the initial state is that the variable `p`, which was previously the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, is now set to 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j`) retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
