Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, p is 0, and j is 2**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`, overwriting its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect in this context.

Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and `j` is 2. After executing the code, the only change is that `p` is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged because the code does not modify them.
