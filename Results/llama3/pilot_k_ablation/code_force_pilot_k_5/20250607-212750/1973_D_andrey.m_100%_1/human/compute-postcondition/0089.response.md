Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 2, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k, and p is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `j` is set to `k`, and the variable `p` is set to 0. The values of the other variables, `n`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m`, remain unchanged.
