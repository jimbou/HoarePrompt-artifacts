Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 4, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k, p is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`, effectively updating the value of `m` based on the current values of `i` and `max_val`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `p`, resetting the value of `p` to 0.

The initial state provides the following information: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `(n // k - 4) * max_val`, `j` is `k`, and `p` is 0.

After executing the code, the value of `m` is updated to `i * max_val`, which is a new value based on the current values of `i` and `max_val`. The value of `p` is reset to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `j` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k - 4`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, and `p` is 0.
