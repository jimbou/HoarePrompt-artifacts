According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases and stdin is empty does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and _ is now 0. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 0**
