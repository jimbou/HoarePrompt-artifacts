State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n` // `k` - 4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, `i` * `n`) returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 3, and `p` is 0. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
