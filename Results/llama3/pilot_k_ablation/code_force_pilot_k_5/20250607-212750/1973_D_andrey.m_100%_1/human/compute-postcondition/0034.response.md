To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head is `j`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `k` is a positive integer greater than 0.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `j` by 1, so `j` becomes 3. The value of `k` remains the same.

The other variables in the state (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, and `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`**
