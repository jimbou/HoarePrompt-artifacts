To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects in it accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 2, and `t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 3. The value of `t` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 2, stdin is empty, _ is 3, and a function named func_3 has been called and executed, and the function func_3 has been called and executed again.**
