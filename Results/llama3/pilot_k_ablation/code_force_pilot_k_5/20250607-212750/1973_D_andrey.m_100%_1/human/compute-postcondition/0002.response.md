Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, stdin is empty, _ is 0, and a function named func_3 has been called and executed.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, stdin, and `_` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them. The code snippet calls a function named `func_3`, which means that the function has been executed, but the output state does not provide any information about the function's behavior or any changes it may have made to the program state.
