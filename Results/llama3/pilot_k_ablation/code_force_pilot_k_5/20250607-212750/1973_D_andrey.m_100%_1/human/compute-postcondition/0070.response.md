Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 1, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k, p is either 0 (if it was greater than or equal to n) or its original value (if it was less than n).**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `j` has reached its maximum value of `k`, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The value of `p` is either 0 (if it exceeded `n` at any point during the loop) or retains its original value (if it remained less than `n` throughout the loop).
