Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 4, k is a positive integer, i is equal to n-4, r is the return value of func_1(1, (n-4) * n), max_val is equal to n-4.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `max_val = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `max_val`. Since `i` is equal to `n-4`, `max_val` becomes `n-4`. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

The initial state provides the following information: `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n-4`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-4) * n)`, and `max_val` is either `n-4` if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, or `n-1` or `n` if `r` is greater than `n`. Since the code snippet only modifies `max_val`, the other variables remain unchanged.

After executing the code, `max_val` is assigned the value of `i`, which is `n-4`. The other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the final output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n-4`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-4) * n)`, and `max_val` is equal to `n-4`.
