The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and `k` remains the same.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 3, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 2**
