Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 4, i is n // k - 1, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 5, p is either 0 (if it was greater than or equal to n) or its original value (if it was less than n).***
