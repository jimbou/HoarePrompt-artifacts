Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `j`, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `p` is `n`, and the value of `func_2(m)` has been returned.**

The value of `func_2(m)` has been returned, but the value of `func_2(m)` is unknown, so the output state does not include any information about the returned value. The values of the other variables are not affected by the code.
