Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is 0, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is 0, j is k, and p is 0.**

This output state indicates that the loop has completed all its iterations. The loop counter `i` has reached 0, and the variables `m` and `p` have been reset to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, and `max_val` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop. The loop has iterated `n // k` times, and the final state reflects the completion of all iterations.
