Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 3, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k. If p is greater than or equal to n, then p is set to 0. Otherwise, p retains its original value.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` retain their original values as defined in the initial state. The variable `j` is set to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times. The variable `p` is either set to 0 if it is greater than or equal to `n`, or retains its original value if it is less than `n`.
