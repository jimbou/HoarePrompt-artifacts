To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `k` is at least 1. Since `j` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 2, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, `p` is 0**
