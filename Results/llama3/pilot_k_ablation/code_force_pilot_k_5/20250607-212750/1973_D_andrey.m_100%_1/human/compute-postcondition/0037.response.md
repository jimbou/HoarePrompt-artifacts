Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `p` has been updated to the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, which can be either 0 or a value less than `n`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that the value of `p` depends on the result of the function `func_1`, which is not specified in the initial state.
