The only variables in the loop head are variable `j` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 4, `i` is `n` // `k` - 3, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 4. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is set to 0. Otherwise, `p` retains its original value.**
