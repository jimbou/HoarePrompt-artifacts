Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 1, stdin is empty, _ is 1, and a function named func_3 has been called and executed.**

The code snippet is simply a function call to `func_3()`, which has already been executed. Since the function has already been executed, there are no changes to the variables or state of the program. The initial state remains the same, with `t` being a positive integer greater than 1, stdin being empty, and the variable `_` being 1. The fact that the function `func_3` has been called and executed is still true, but it does not affect the state of the variables.
