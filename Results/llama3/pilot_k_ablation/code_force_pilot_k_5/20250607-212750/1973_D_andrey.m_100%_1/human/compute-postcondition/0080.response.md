The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is n // k - 2, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 3, and if p is greater than or equal to n, p is 0**
