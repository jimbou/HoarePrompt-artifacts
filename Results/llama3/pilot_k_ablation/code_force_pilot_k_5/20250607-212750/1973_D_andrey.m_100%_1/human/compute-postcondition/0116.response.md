Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, i is n // k - 4, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 2, and p is 0**

The code snippet does not modify any variables. The first line assigns 0 to `p`, but this does not change its value since it was already 0. The second line is a `break` statement, which is not inside a loop or a switch statement, so it does not have any effect. Therefore, all variables remain unchanged.
