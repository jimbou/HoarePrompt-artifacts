The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `n` // `k` - 4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, `i` * `n`) returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 2, and `p` is 0**
