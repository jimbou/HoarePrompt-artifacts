Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 3, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 1. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
