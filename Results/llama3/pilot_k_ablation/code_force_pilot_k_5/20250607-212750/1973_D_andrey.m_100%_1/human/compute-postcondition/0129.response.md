Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is 0, `j` is `k`, `p` is 0, and the function `func_2(-1)` has been executed and returned a value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the execution of `func_2(-1)`. The function `func_2(-1)` has been executed and returned a value, but the specific value returned is not specified in the initial state.
