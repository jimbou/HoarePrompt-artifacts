Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n-4`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-4) * n)`, `max_val` is either `n-4` if `r` is less than or equal to `n`, or `n-1` or `n` if `r` is greater than `n`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `r` is updated to be the return value of `func_1(1, (n-4) * n)`, which is a new calculation based on the current values of `n` and `i`. The value of `max_val` is also updated based on the new value of `r`, following the same logic as before.
