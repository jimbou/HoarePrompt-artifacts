Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `p` is the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`, and `j` is 1 if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise no changes are made to `j`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged. The value of `p` is updated to the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `p + 1` and `m`. If the new value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `j` is set to 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.
