Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 4, stdin is empty, _ is 4, and a function named func_3 has been called and executed four times.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was initially a positive integer greater than 4. The stdin remains empty as there was no input operation performed. The value of `_` also remains the same, which is 4. The only change is that the function `func_3` has been called and executed four times, one more time than the initial state.
