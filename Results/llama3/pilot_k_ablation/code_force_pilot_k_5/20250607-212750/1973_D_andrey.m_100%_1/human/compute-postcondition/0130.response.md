Functionality: **This function takes two positive integers n and k as input, where n is the length of a hidden array and k is the number of subarrays in the desired split. It attempts to find the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, and then uses this value to find a suitable subarray size m. If a suitable m is found, the function calls func_2(m) and returns. If no suitable m is found, the function calls func_2(-1). The function's purpose is to perform a specific operation on the hidden array based on the input parameters n and k, and it affects the input variables by potentially modifying the hidden array.**
