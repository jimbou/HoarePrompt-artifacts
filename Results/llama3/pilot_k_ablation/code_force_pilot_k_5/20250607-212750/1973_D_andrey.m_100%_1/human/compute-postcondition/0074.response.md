Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 2, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 1, and the current value of `p` is greater than or equal to `n`.***
