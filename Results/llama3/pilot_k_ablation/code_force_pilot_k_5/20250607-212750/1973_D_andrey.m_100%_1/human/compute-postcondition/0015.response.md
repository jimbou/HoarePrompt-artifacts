The code reassigns the value of `r` to be the return value of `func_1(1, i * n)`. The value of `i` is `n-3`, so `i * n` is `(n-3) * n`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The value of `max_val` depends on the value of `r`, but since the value of `r` has changed, the value of `max_val` is no longer determined by the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)`, `max_val` is either `n-1` or `n` depending on the new value of `r`.**
