Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is n // k - 2, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 4, p is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the program flow.

The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`. Since the code snippet only modifies the variable `p` and the `break` statement has no effect, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state includes the updated value of `p` as 0, and the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
