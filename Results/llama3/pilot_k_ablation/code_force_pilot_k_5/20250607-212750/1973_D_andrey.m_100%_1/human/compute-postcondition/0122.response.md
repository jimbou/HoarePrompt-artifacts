Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, i is n // k - 4, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 4, p is 0**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, or `j`. The first line assigns the value 0 to `p`. The second line, `break`, is not executed because it is not inside a loop, so it does not affect the state of the variables. Since `p` is now 0, which is less than `n`, the condition that would prevent changes to the variables is not met. However, there are no changes made to the variables other than `p`, so the state of the variables remains mostly unchanged.
