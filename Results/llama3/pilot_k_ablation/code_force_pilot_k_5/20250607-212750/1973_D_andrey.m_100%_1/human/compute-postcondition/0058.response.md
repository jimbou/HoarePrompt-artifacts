To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it. The loop head is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`
* `k` is a positive integer greater than 0
* `i` is `n // k - 1`
* `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`
* `m` is `i * max_val`
* `j` is 1
* If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.

Since the loop head only involves the variable `j` and the range `1` to `k + 1`, we can only adjust the state of `j`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state of `j` is 2.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 2. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
