Output State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `p` is either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `j` has reached the value of `k`, and the value of `p` is either 0 (if `p` was greater than or equal to `n` at any point during the loop) or the result of the last call to `func_1(p + 1, m)`, which is either 0 or a value less than `n`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged.
