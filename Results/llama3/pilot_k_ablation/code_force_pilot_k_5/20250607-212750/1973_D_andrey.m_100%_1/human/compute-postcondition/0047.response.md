Output State: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `j`, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, `p` is either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `n` and `k` are positive integers where `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `i` is the integer division of `n` by `k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is the product of `i` and `max_val`, `j` is equal to `k`, and `p` is either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`.
