Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 1, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 2, p is 0.**

The code snippet assigns 0 to `p` and then encounters a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Since `p` is assigned 0, it is now 0 regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j`) are not modified by the code and retain their initial values.
