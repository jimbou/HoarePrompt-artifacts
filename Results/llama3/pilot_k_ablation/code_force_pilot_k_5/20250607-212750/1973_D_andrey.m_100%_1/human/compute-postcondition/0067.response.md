The only variable in the loop head is variable j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and k. If j is less than k + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is 4, k is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, j must be increased by 1 and k must be greater than 4.
State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 4, i is n // k - 1, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 5, p is either 0 (if it was greater than or equal to n) or its original value (if it was less than n)**
