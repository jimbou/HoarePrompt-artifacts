To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, and `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 4. The value of `k` remains the same.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is `n // k - 2`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 4, `p` is 0 if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise no changes are made to `p`.**
