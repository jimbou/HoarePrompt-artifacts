According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `k` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, the loop variable `j` is not initialized to a value that would allow the loop to execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `j` to 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, `i` * `n`) returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 1, `p` is 0**
