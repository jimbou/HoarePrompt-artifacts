Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 2, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k, p is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`. Since `m` was already defined as `i * max_val` in the initial state, this line does not change the value of `m`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `p`. Since `p` was either 0 (if it was greater than or equal to `n`) or its original value (if it was less than `n`) in the initial state, this line changes the value of `p` to 0 regardless of its previous value. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
