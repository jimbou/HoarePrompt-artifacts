To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`. This means that `i` will decrement by 1 in each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `n-2`. To execute the loop again, `i` should be decremented by 1, so `i` becomes `n-3`.

The loop will execute again if `i` is greater than 0. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `n-3` will be greater than 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 3.

The other variables `k`, `r`, and `max_val` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-2) * n)`, `max_val` is either `n-1` or `n` depending on the value of `r`.**
