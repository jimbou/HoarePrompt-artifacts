Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 1, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 3, p is 0**

The code snippet assigns 0 to `p` and then encounters a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Therefore, the only change is that `p` becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
