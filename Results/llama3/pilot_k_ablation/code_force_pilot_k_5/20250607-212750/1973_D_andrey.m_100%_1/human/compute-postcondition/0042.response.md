The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `k` is greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 5, `p` is either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`.**
