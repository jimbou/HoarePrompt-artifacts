Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 5. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then `p` is 0. Otherwise, `p` is either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`.***
