The only variables in the loop head are variables  _ and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables _ and t. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 3, t is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, _ must be increased by 1, so _ is 4, and for the loop to execute again t must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 4, stdin is empty, _ is 4, and a function named func_3 has been called and executed three times.**
