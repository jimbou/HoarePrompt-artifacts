Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, i is n // k - 4, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 5, p is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`, which was previously either 0 or greater than or equal to `n`. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables and is likely used to exit a loop or a switch statement (not shown in the provided code snippet). Since there are no other changes to the variables, the final state remains the same as the initial state, except for the value of `p`, which is now 0.
