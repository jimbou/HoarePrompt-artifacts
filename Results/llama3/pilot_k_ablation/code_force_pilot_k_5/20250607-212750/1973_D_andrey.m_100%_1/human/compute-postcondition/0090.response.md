To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the values of the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

According to the loop statement, `i` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be `n // k - 3`.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop.

The value of `k` also remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop.

The other variables `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` are not part of the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k - 3`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, and `p` is 0**
