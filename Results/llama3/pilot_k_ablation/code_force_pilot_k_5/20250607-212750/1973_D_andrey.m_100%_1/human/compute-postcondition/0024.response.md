Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer, i is n // k, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, p is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`. Since `i` is `n // k` and `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` becomes the product of `i` and `max_val`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `p`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
