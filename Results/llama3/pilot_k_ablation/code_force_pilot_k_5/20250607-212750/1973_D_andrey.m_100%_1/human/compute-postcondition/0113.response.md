Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 4, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 1, and p is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`, overwriting its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or their values.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `p`, which is now 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j`) retain their original values and properties as described in the initial state.
