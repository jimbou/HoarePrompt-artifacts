The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is `n` // `k` - 4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, `i` * `n`) returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 4. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, the state of the variables remains unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
