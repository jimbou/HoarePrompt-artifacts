Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 4, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k, and p is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, and `m` remain unchanged from their initial values. The value of `j` is equal to `k`, indicating that the loop has executed `k` times. The value of `p` is 0, which means that the loop has either completed all its iterations or was terminated early due to the condition `p >= n` being met.
