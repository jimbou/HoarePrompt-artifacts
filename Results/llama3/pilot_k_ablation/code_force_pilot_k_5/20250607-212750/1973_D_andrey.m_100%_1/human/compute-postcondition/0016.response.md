Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, k is a positive integer, i is equal to n-3, r is the return value of func_1(1, (n-3) * n), max_val is equal to n-3.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `max_val = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `max_val`, and the second line is a break statement that does not affect any variables.

Initially, `i` is equal to `n-3`, so after the first line, `max_val` becomes equal to `n-3`. The second line does not change any variables.

The other variables, `n`, `k`, and `r`, are not modified by the code snippet, so their values remain the same as in the initial state.
