Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n-3`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is equal to `n-3`. Otherwise, `max_val` is either `n-1` or `n` depending on the new value of `r`.***
