To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(n // k, 0, -1):`, which means `i` will decrease by 1 in each iteration.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`
* `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `j`
* `i` is `n // k`
* `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`
* `m` is `i * max_val`
* `j` is `k`
* `p` is either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`
* `p` is not equal to `n`

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we only need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i`, `n`, and `k`.

Since `i` is `n // k` and the loop iterates in reverse order (`-1` step), `i` will decrease by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `n // k - 1`.

The values of `n` and `k` do not change, as they are not modified by the loop iteration.

The other variables (`max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`) are not directly affected by the loop iteration and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `j`, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is `k`, and `p` is either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)` which is either 0 or a value less than `n`. Additionally, `p` is not equal to `n`.**
