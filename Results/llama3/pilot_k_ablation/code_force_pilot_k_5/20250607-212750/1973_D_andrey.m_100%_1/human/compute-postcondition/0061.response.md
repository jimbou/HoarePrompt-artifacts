To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The only object in the loop head is `j`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `k`. If `j` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3.

The other variables in the state (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n // k - 1`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 3, `p` is either 0 (if `p` is greater than or equal to `n`) or its original value (if `p` is less than `n`).**
