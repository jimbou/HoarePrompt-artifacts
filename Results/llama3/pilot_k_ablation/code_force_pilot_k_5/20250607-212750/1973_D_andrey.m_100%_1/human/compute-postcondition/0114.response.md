Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 4, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, `i` * `n`) returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i` * `max_val`, `j` is 1, and `p` is 0. If `p` is greater than or equal to `n`, then the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged. Otherwise, no changes are made to the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`.***
