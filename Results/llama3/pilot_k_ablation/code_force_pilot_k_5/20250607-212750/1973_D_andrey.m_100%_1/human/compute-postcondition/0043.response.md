Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, i is n // k, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 5, p is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the nearest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

The initial state provides information about the variables `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, `j`, and `p`. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The only variable affected by the code is `p`, which is assigned the value 0.

Therefore, the final output state includes all the variables from the initial state, with `p` being the only variable modified to 0.
