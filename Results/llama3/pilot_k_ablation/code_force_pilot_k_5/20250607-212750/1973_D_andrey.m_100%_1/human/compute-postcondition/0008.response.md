Output State: **`t` is a positive integer that must be greater than 2, stdin is empty, _ is 3, and a function named func_3 has been called and executed three times.**

The code calls the function func_3, which has already been called and executed twice before. The function is called again, making it a total of three times. The values of the other variables, `t` and `_`, remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty as there is no input operation performed.
