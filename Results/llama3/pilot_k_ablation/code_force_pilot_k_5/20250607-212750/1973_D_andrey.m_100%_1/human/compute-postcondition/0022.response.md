Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `max_val` will be set to the maximum value of `i` for which the function `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. If no such `i` is found, `max_val` will remain 0. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
