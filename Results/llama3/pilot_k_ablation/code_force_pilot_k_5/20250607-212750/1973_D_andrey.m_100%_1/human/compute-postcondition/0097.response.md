Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 3, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 2, p is 0**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to the variable `p`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

Therefore, the only change to the initial state is the assignment of the value 0 to the variable `p`. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j`) retain their initial values, as they are not modified by the code snippet.
