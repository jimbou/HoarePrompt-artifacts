To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i`, `n`, and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n // k` is greater than 0, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to `k`. Additionally, `i` will start from `n // k` and decrement by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

Since `max_val` is not in the loop head, we cannot adjust its state. However, we can infer that `max_val` is related to the function `func_1(1, i * n)`, but we don't have enough information to adjust its state.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is `n // k`, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`**

Note that we've only adjusted the states of `n`, `k`, and `i`, which are the variables in the loop head.
