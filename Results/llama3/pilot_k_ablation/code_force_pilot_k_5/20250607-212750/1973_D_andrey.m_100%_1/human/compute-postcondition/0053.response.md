Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to j, i is n // k - 1, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k, and p is 0.**

The first line of the code, `m = i * max_val`, assigns the value of `i * max_val` to `m`. Since `i` is `n // k - 1` and `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, the value of `m` becomes `i * max_val`.

The second line, `p = 0`, assigns the value 0 to `p`.

No other variables are affected by the code. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `j`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Note that the value of `p` is now 0, which is different from its initial value, which was either 0 or the result of `func_1(p + 1, m)`.
