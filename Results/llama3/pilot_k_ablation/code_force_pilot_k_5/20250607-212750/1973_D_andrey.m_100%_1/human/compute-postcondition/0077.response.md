To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(1, k + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `j` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, and `k` is a positive integer greater than 0.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `k` remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is 2
* `k` remains a positive integer greater than 0

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is a positive integer greater than 0, `i` is `n` // `k` - 2, `max_val` is the maximum value of `i` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`, `m` is `i * max_val`, `j` is 2, and `p` is 0**
