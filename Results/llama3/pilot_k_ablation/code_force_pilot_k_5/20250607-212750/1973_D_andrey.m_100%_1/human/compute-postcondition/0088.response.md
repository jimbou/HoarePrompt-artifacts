Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is n // k - 2, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 5. If p is greater than or equal to n, then p is set to 0. Otherwise, no changes are made to p.***
