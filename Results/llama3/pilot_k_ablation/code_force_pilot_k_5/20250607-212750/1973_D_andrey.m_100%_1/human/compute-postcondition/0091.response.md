Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 3, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is k, and p is 0**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `j`, or `p`. The first line reassigns the value of `m` to be equal to `i * max_val`, but since `m` was already equal to `i * max_val` in the initial state, this line does not change the value of `m`. The second line assigns the value 0 to `p`, but since `p` was already 0 in the initial state, this line also does not change the value of `p`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
