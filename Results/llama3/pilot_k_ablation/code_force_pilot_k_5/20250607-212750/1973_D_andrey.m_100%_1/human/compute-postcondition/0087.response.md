Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, i is n // k - 2, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 5, p is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line assigns the value 0 to `p`, effectively resetting its value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or the program's flow.

Given the initial state, all variables except `p` retain their original values and relationships. The value of `p` is set to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j`) are not modified by the code snippet, so their values and relationships remain unchanged.
