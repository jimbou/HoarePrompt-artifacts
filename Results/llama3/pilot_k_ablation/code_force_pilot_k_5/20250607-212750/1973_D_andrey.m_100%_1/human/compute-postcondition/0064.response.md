To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, k + 1):`. The variables involved are `j` and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 4.

The value of `k` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables `n`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `p` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 1, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 4, p is either 0 (if it was greater than or equal to n) or its original value (if it was less than n)**
