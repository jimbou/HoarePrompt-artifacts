Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than or equal to k, k is a positive integer greater than 0, i is n // k - 3, max_val is the maximum value of i such that func_1(1, i * n) returns a value less than or equal to n, m is i * max_val, j is 3, p is 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `p = 0` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `p` to 0. The second line, `break`, is a statement that is typically used to exit a loop or a switch statement. However, in this context, it does not have any effect on the variables or their values because there is no loop or switch statement to break out of.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `p` is now 0. All other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, `max_val`, `m`, and `j`) retain their original values as specified in the initial state.
