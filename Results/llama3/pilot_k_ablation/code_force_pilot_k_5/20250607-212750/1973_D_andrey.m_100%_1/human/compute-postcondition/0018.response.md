To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(n, 0, -1):`, which means the loop will iterate from `n` down to `1` in reverse order, decrementing `i` by `1` each time.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `3`.
- `k` is a positive integer (its value doesn't affect the loop directly).
- `i` is equal to `n-3`.
- `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-3) * n)`, and its value determines `max_val`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we focus on `i` and `n` since they are the variables in the loop head.

1. **Adjusting `i`**: Since `i` is currently `n-3` and the loop decrements `i` by `1` each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented to `n-4`.

2. **Adjusting `n`**: The value of `n` does not change within the loop, so it remains the same. However, since `i` has decremented and must still be greater than `0` for the loop to continue, `n` must be such that `n-4` is greater than `0`. This implies `n` must be greater than `4`.

Other variables (`k`, `r`, `max_val`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n-4`, `r` is the return value of `func_1(1, (n-4) * n)`. If `r` is less than or equal to `n`, then `max_val` is equal to `n-4`. Otherwise, `max_val` is either `n-1` or `n` depending on the new value of `r`.**
