Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the maximum value `max_val` is not found in the first iteration of the outer loop in `func_3()`. In this case, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum value `m` that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.

For example, if the input array is `[2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`, the program will not find the maximum value `max_val` in the first iteration of the outer loop, and therefore will not correctly calculate the maximum value `m` that can be achieved by splitting the array into `k` subarrays.

To fix this issue, the program should continue to iterate over the possible values of `max_val` until it finds the correct one, or until it has checked all possible values.
