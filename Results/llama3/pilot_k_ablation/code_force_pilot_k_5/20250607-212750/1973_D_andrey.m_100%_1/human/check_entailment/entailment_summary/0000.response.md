Correctness: **True**

Reasoning: 

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program starts with `func_4()`, which reads the number of test cases `t` and calls `func_3()` for each test case.

2. `func_3()` takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input, representing the length of the hidden array and the number of subarrays in the desired split, respectively.

3. The function first attempts to find the maximum value `max_val` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. This is done by iterating from `n` down to 1 and checking if `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. If such a value is found, it is stored in `max_val`.

4. If `max_val` is greater than 0, the function then attempts to find a suitable subarray size `m` by iterating from `n // k` down to 1. For each `m`, it checks if `func_1(p + 1, m)` returns a value equal to `n` for all `k` subarrays. If such an `m` is found, the function calls `func_2(m)` and returns.

5. If no suitable `m` is found, the function calls `func_2(-1)`.

6. `func_2(m)` prints an exclamation mark followed by the positive integer `m`, waits for user input, and returns the user's input as an integer.

7. `func_1(l, x)` prints a question mark followed by the positive integers `l` and `x`, waits for user input, and returns the user's input as an integer.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It attempts to find the largest value `m` such that there exists a sequence of `k-1` subarrays with `f(1, c_1) = f(c_1 + 1, c_2) = ... = f(c_{k-1}+1, n) = m`. If such an `m` is found, it prints the answer using `func_2(m)`. If no such `m` is found, it prints -1 using `func_2(-1)`.

Overall, the program's logic is correct, and it should produce the correct output for the given problem description.
