Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value m such that a hidden array can be split into exactly k subarrays, each with a product of its length and maximum equal to m. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of m.

The program consists of four functions: func_1, func_2, func_3, and func_4. func_1 is used to query the hidden array and find the smallest positive integer r such that f(l, r) = x, where f(l, r) is the maximum of the subarray a_l, ..., a_r multiplied by its size. func_2 is used to print the answer m and receive feedback from the judge. func_3 is the main function that takes two positive integers n and k as input and attempts to find the maximum value of m. func_4 is the entry point of the program that reads the number of test cases and calls func_3 for each test case.

The program's logic is correct, and it follows the problem description. The binary search approach used in func_3 is efficient and effective in finding the maximum value of m. The program also handles the case where no suitable m is found and prints -1 as the answer.

However, there are a few potential issues with the program. The program assumes that the input is valid and does not handle cases where the input is invalid. For example, if the input n or k is not a positive integer, the program may produce incorrect results or crash. Additionally, the program does not handle cases where the hidden array is empty or contains only one element.

Overall, the program is correct and efficient, but it could be improved by adding input validation and handling edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
