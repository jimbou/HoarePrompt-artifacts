Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve an interactive problem where the goal is to find the largest value `m` such that the array can be split into exactly `k` subarrays, each with the product of its length and maximum equal to `m`. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value `m`.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program starts by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, the program reads the length of the hidden array `n` and the number of subarrays `k`.
3. The program defines three functions: `func_1`, `func_2`, and `func_3`. `func_1` is used to make queries to the hidden array, `func_2` is used to print the answer, and `func_3` is the main function that solves the problem.
4. In `func_3`, the program first finds the maximum value `max_val` that can be achieved by multiplying the length of the array with the maximum value in the array. This is done by iterating from `n` to 1 and making queries to the hidden array using `func_1`.
5. Once `max_val` is found, the program iterates from `n // k` to 1 and calculates the value `m` by multiplying `i` with `max_val`. It then makes queries to the hidden array using `func_1` to check if it's possible to split the array into `k` subarrays with the product of length and maximum equal to `m`.
6. If the program finds a value `m` that satisfies the condition, it prints the answer using `func_2` and returns. If no such value is found, it prints -1 as the answer.

The program's correctness can be verified by analyzing the following aspects:

* The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables.
* The program correctly implements the binary search approach to find the maximum value `m`.
* The program correctly makes queries to the hidden array using `func_1` and handles the responses.
* The program correctly prints the answer using `func_2` and handles the response.

Based on the above analysis, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
