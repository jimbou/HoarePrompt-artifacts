Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the interactive problem described in the problem statement. The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value `m` such that the array can be split into `k` subarrays, each with a product of its length and maximum equal to `m`.

The program first finds the maximum value `max_val` such that `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. This is done by iterating from `n` to `1` and checking if `func_1(1, i * n)` returns a value less than or equal to `n`. If it does, `max_val` is set to `i` and the loop is broken.

Then, the program iterates from `n // k` to `1` and checks if the current value `i` multiplied by `max_val` can be used to split the array into `k` subarrays. This is done by calling `func_1(p + 1, m)` for each subarray and checking if the returned value is equal to `n`. If it is, the program calls `func_2(m)` to print the answer and returns.

If no such `m` is found, the program calls `func_2(-1)` to print the answer `-1`.

The program also correctly handles the input and output operations, using `sys.stdout.flush()` to ensure that the output is printed immediately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
