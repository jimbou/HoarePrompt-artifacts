Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, followed by t integers n, each representing the size of the grid.

The program's logic is as follows:

1. For each test case, it prints the points (1, 1) and (1, 2).
2. Then, for each integer i from 3 to n + 2, it prints the point (i, i).

The program's output is based on the observation that the Manhattan distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|. By printing the points (1, 1) and (1, 2), the program ensures that the Manhattan distance between these two points is 1. Then, by printing the points (i, i) for i from 3 to n + 2, the program ensures that the Manhattan distance between each of these points and the point (1, 1) is i - 1, and the Manhattan distance between each of these points and the point (1, 2) is i - 2.

The program's logic is correct because it ensures that the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of points is maximized. The program's output is consistent with the examples provided in the problem description, and it produces the correct output for the given inputs.

Correctness: **True**
