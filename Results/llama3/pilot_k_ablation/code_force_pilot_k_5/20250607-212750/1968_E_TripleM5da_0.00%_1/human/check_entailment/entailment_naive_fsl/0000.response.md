Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description asks to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells, but the program does not guarantee this. 

For example, when n = 3, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
3 3

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. A better arrangement would be:

2 1
2 3
3 1

which has a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances: {0, 1, 2, 3}.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
