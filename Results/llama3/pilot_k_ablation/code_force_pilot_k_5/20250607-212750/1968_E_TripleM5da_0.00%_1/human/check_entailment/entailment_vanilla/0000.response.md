Reasoning:

The given program is attempting to solve the problem by printing out a set of points that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.

However, upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the program is not correctly implementing the solution. The program is printing out points in a fixed pattern, regardless of the input value of n. This means that the program is not actually maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

For example, when n = 3, the program prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), and (3, 3). However, this is not the optimal solution, as the points (2, 1), (2, 3), and (3, 1) would result in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Similarly, when n = 4, the program prints out the points (1, 1), (1, 2), (3, 3), and (4, 4). Again, this is not the optimal solution, as the points (1, 1), (1, 3), (4, 3), and (4, 4) would result in a larger set of distinct Manhattan distances.

In general, the program is not correctly implementing the solution, and is instead printing out a fixed set of points that do not necessarily maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **False**
