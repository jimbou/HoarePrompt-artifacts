The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 55, `n` is 53. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, stdin contains some input**
