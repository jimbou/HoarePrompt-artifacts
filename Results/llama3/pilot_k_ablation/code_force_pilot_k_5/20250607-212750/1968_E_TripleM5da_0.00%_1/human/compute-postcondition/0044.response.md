The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 52 and 53 inclusive, `n` is greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 53. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new value of `i`. So, `i` is between 53 and 54 inclusive, and `n` is greater than or equal to 53 and less than or equal to 54.
State: **`i` is an integer between 53 and 54 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 53 and less than or equal to 54, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1 2, and the value of `i` which is between 53 and 54 inclusive is being printed twice.**
