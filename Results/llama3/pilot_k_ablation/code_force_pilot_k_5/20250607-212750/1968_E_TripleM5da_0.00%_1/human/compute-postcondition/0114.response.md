Functionality: **The function reads a series of inputs from stdin, where the first input is an integer t (1 <= t <= 50) representing the number of test cases, followed by t integers n (2 <= n <= 10^3). For each test case, it prints a sequence of numbers, starting with (1, 1) and (1, 2), and then for each integer i from 3 to n + 2, it prints (i, i). The function does not return any value, and its purpose is to generate and print a specific pattern of numbers based on the input values.**
