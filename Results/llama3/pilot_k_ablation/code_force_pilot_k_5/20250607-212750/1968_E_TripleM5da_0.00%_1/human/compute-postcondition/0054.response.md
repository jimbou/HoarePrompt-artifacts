The code prints the value of `i` twice. Based on the precondition, the value of `i` is between 53 and 54 inclusive. However, the precondition also mentions that the value of `i` is 4, which seems to be a contradiction. Since the precondition explicitly states that `i` is 4, we will use this value.

Output: **4, 4**
