The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is `n + 3` does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and i is now 3. 
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 3` (each twice) have been printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2**
