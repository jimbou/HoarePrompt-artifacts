The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer between 7 and 56 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than or equal to `i+2`. Since `i` is an integer between 7 and 56 inclusive, `i+1` is an integer between 8 and 57 inclusive. Therefore, `n` must be greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 59.
State: **`i` is an integer between 8 and 57 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 59**
