The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 6, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains some input, and the value of `i` which is 6 is printed twice**
