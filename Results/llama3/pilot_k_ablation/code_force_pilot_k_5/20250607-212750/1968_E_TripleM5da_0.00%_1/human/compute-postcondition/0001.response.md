Output State: **`i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a list of `n` integers where 2 <= n <= 10^3**.

In this output state, the value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The value of `n` is assigned the integer input from stdin, which is between 1 and 50 inclusive. The stdin now contains a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between 2 and 10^3 inclusive.
