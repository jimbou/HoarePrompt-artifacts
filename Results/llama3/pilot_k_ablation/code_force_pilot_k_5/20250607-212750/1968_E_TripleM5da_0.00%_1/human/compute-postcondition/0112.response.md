Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` (each twice) have been printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `i` has reached the value of `n + 2`, where `n` is an integer. The input from stdin is still present, and the output includes the initial print statements (1, 1 and 1, 2), followed by the value of `i` being printed twice for each iteration of the loop, starting from 3 and ending at `n + 2`.
