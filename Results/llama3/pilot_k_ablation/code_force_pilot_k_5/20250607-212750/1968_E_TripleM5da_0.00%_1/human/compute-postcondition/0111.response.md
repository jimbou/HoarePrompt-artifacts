Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 3` (each twice) have been printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` have been printed twice.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` will have been printed twice. The initial state of `n` being an integer from stdin and stdin containing some input remains unchanged.
