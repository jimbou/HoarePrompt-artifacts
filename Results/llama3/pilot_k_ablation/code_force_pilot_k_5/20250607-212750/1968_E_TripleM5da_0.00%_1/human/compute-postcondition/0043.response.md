Output State: **`i` is an integer between 52 and 53 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 53, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1 2, and the value of `i` which is between 52 and 53 inclusive is being printed twice.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be between 52 and 53 (inclusive), and the value of `n` will be between 52 and 53 (inclusive). The input from stdin remains unchanged (i.e., no input), and the output will include the initial print statement "1 2" followed by the value of `i` printed twice, which will be between 52 and 53.
