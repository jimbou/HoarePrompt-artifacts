You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: Output State: `i` is 55, `n` is 53, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1 2, and the value of `i` which is between 53 and 54 inclusive is being printed twice, and 1 is printed twice, and 1 and 2 are printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 4 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 6 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 7 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 7 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 8 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 9 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 10 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 11 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 12 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 13 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 14 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 15 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 16 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 17 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 18 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 19 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 20 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 21 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 22 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 23 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 24 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 25 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 26 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 27 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 28 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 29 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 30 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 31 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 32 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 33 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 34 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 35 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 36 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 37 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 38 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 39 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 40 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 41 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 42 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 43 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 44 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 45 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 46 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 47 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 48 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 49 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 50 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 51 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 52 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 53 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 54 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 55 is being printed twice.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` is 55, `n` is 53, and the input from stdin is empty. The output includes the initial print statements, followed by the value of `i` being printed twice for each iteration of the loop, starting from 3 and ending at 55.
```
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
