To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 2):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range from 3 to `n + 1` (since the upper bound is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified within the loop. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, as it is not related to the loop head.

The numbers 3 and 3 being printed are not relevant to the loop head, so we can ignore them.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a list of `n` integers where 2 <= n <= 10^3**
