To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 2):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of numbers from 3 to `n + 2` (exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 6, and `n` is at least 4. This means that the loop has already iterated over the values 3, 4, 5, and 6.

For the loop to execute again, the next value of `i` must be within the range of the loop. Since `i` is currently 6, the next value would be 7. However, the loop will only execute again if `n + 2` is greater than or equal to 7.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`i` is 7, `n` is at least 5**

Note that we only adjusted the states of `i` and `n`, as they are the only variables in the loop head. The value of `i` which is 6 being printed twice is not relevant to the loop's execution, so we didn't consider it when determining the next state.
