Based on the precondition, `i` is an integer between 6 and 55 inclusive, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4.

The `print` statement is `print(i, i)`, which means it will print the value of `i` twice.

Since `i` is an integer between 6 and 55 inclusive, its value can be any integer within this range. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `i` without more information.

Therefore, the output will be the value of `i` printed twice, where `i` is an integer between 6 and 55 inclusive.

Output: **i (where i is an integer between 6 and 55 inclusive), i (where i is an integer between 6 and 55 inclusive)**
