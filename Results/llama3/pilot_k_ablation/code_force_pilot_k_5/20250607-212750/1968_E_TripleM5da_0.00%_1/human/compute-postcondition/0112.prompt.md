Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 <= t <= 50) and then t integers (2 <= n <= 10^3).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(0, int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    print(1, 1)
    print(1, 2)
    for i in range(3, n + 2):
        print(i, i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a list of `n` integers where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and the value of `i` which is `n + 2` is being printed twice as `n + 2` `n + 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `i` is an integer between 52 and 53 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 52 and less than or equal to 53, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1 2, and the value of `i` which is between 52 and 53 inclusive is being printed twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: Output State: `i` is 55, `n` is 53, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1 2, and the value of `i` which is between 53 and 54 inclusive is being printed twice, and 1 is printed twice, and 1 and 2 are printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 4 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 6 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 7 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 7 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 8 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 9 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 10 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 11 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 12 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 13 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 14 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 15 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 16 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 17 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 18 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 19 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 20 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 21 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 22 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 23 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 24 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 25 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 26 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 27 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 28 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 29 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 30 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 31 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 32 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 33 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 34 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 35 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 36 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 37 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 38 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 39 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 40 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 41 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 42 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 43 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 44 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 45 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 46 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 47 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 48 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 49 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 50 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 51 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 52 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 53 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 54 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 55 is being printed twice.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` is 55, `n` is 53, and the input from stdin is empty. The output includes the initial print statements, followed by the value of `i` being printed twice for each iteration of the loop, starting from 3 and ending at 55.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` (each twice) have been printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 3` (each twice) have been printed, and this is printed: 1, 1, and this is printed: 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` have been printed twice.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
