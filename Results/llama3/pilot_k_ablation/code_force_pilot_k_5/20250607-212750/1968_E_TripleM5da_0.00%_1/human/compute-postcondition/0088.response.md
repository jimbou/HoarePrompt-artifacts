Output State: `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` (each twice) have been printed.

In natural language, after the loop finishes executing, the variable `i` will have a value equal to `n + 2`, and the variable `n` will still be an integer. The input in stdin will remain unchanged. The output will include the initial values 1 and 2, followed by each value from 3 to `n + 2`, with each of these values printed twice.
