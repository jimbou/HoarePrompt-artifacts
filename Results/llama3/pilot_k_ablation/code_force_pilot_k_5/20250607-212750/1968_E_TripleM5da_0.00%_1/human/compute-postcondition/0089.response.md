Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` (each twice) have been printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `i` will be `n + 2`, and the value of `n` will still be an integer. The input in stdin will remain unchanged. The output will include the initial values 1 and 2, followed by the values from 3 to `n + 2`, each printed twice.
