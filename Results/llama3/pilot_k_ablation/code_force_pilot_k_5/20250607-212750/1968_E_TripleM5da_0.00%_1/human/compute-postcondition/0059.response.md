The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2` and `i` is greater than or equal to 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is at least 6, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1 2, and the value of `i` which is between 53 and 54 inclusive is being printed twice, and 1 is printed twice, and 1 and 2 are printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 4 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed twice, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed twice**
