The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, i is 0 and n is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and i is now 3. 
State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a list of `n` integers where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and the numbers 1 and 2 are being printed**
