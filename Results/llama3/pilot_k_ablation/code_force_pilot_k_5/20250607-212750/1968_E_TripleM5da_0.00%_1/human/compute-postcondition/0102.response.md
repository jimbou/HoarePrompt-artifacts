To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 2):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 2`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than 1.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 5. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 5 - 2 = 3.

The other states, such as the values printed to stdout, are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains some input**
