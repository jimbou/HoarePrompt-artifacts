Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a list of `n` integers where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and the value of `i` which is `n + 2` is being printed twice as `n + 2` `n + 2`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to `n + 2`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and the input in stdin remains the same list of `n` integers. The loop will print the value of `i` (which is `n + 2`) twice, resulting in the output `n + 2` `n + 2`.
