To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input value from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 2` (each twice) have been printed.

To execute the loop again, the input value from `stdin` must be greater than `n + 2`, because the loop iterates from 0 to the input value. If the input value is not greater than `n + 2`, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` is an integer, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 3` (each twice) have been printed.**

Note that we can only adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input value from `stdin`. The other variables, such as `n`, are not part of the loop head and cannot be adjusted.
