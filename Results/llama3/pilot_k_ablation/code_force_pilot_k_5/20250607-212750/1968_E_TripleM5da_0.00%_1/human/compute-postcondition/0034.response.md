To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(3, n + 2):`

The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the loop head, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[3, n + 2)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer between 5 and 54 inclusive, and `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `n` needs to be adjusted such that the new value of `i` is still within the range `[3, n + 2)`.

Let's calculate the new value of `i`:

`i` is an integer between 5 and 54 inclusive, so the next value of `i` will be between 6 and 55 inclusive.

Now, we need to adjust `n` such that the new value of `i` is still within the range `[3, n + 2)`.

Since `i` is between 6 and 55 inclusive, we need `n + 2` to be greater than or equal to 6.

Therefore, `n` needs to be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`i` is an integer between 6 and 55 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4**
