To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. Since `i` is already between 4 and 53 inclusive, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to adjust `n` to be at least 3 for the loop to execute.

State: **`i` is an integer between 4 and 53 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains no input, and this is printed: 1 2**
