To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(0, int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input value, which is an integer.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n + 2`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, and the input value is a list of `n` integers.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the input value. Since `i` is `n + 2`, the input value must be greater than `n + 2`.

However, the input value is a list of `n` integers, where `n` is between 1 and 50 inclusive. This means that the length of the input list is `n`, not `n + 2`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the input list must have at least `n + 3` elements, not just `n` elements.

State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a list of `n + 3` integers**
