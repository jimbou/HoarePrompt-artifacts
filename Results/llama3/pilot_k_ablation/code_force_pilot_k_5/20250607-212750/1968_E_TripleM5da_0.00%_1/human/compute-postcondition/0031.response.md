To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(3, n + 2):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range `[3, n + 2)`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer between 4 and 53 inclusive. This means that `i` has already taken on the value of 3 in a previous iteration and has been incremented to a value between 4 and 53.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to the next value in the range. Since `i` is currently between 4 and 53, the next value of `i` must be between 5 and 54.

The value of `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. Since `i` is currently between 4 and 53, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5 to ensure that `i` can take on the next value in the range.

The other states, such as the input in `stdin` and the printed values, are not relevant to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is an integer between 5 and 54 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5**
