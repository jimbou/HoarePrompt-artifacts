To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(3, n + 2):`

The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is at least 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 2`. Since `i` is 4, `n + 2` must be greater than 4. Therefore, `n` must be at least 3.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 5 (since it increments by 1)
* `n` is at least 3

The other states, such as the values printed and the input in stdin, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is 5, `n` is at least 3**
