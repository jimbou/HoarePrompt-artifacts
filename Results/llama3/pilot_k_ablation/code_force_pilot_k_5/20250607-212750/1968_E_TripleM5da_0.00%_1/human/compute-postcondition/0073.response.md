To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `i` is 0, but it needs to be adjusted to 3 for the loop to execute. Also, `n` needs to be adjusted to be at least 1.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is at least 1, stdin contains some input, and this is printed: 1, 2**
