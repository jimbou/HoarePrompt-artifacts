Output State: **`i` is `n + 3`, `n` is an integer from stdin, stdin contains some input, and the values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 3` (each twice) have been printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to an integer from the input, and the value of `i` is still `n + 3`. The values 1, 2, and the values from 3 to `n + 3` (each twice) have been printed, and the stdin still contains some input.
