The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 6, and `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`i` is 6, `n` is an integer between 5 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains one input: a list of `n` integers where 2 <= n <= 10^3, and the value of `i` which is 6 is being printed twice as 6 6**
