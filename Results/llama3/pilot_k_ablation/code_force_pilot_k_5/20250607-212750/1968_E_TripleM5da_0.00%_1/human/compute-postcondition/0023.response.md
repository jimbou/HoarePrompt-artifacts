Output State: **`i` is an integer between 4 and 53 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive, stdin contains no input**.

In this output state, `n` is assigned the value of an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive from the input, and `i` is still equal to `n + 3`, so `i` is an integer between 4 and 53 inclusive. The stdin contains one input: a list of `n + 3` integers, but since `n` is assigned a value from the input, the stdin now contains no input.
