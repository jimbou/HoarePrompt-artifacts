To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(3, n + 2):`

The objects in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 2`. Since `i` is currently 6, we need to adjust `i` to be the next value in the range.

The range starts at 3, so the next value after 6 would be 7.

As for `n`, its value is currently greater than 4, but we don't know its exact value. However, since `i` is 6, we know that `n + 2` must be greater than 6. Therefore, `n` must be greater than 4.

The state of `stdin` and the printed values are not relevant to the loop head, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`i` is 7, `n` is greater than 4**
