Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem involving expected values of friendship pairs in a class. The program reads multiple test cases, each consisting of the number of children (n), the number of pairs of friends (m), and the number of excursions (k), followed by m lines containing the indices of the pair of children who are friends and their friendship value.

The program calculates the expected value of the sum of friendship values of all k pairs chosen for the excursions using modular arithmetic. It first calculates the sum of the initial friendship values (S) and the total number of possible pairs (C). Then, it calculates the numerator (num) and denominator (den) of the expected value using the given formula.

The program then finds the greatest common divisor (g) of the numerator and denominator and divides both by g to simplify the fraction. It calculates the modular inverse of the denominator (den) using the pow function with a negative exponent, which is equivalent to calculating the modular multiplicative inverse.

Finally, the program multiplies the numerator by the modular inverse of the denominator and takes the result modulo 10^9+7 to obtain the final answer.

The execution summary indicates that the function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results, which suggests that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
