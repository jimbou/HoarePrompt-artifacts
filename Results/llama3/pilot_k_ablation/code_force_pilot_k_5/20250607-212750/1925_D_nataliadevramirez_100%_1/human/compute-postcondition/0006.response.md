Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first two lines of the input, `p` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line than before**

In this output state, the value of `S` has been updated to include the third element of the second line of the input, in addition to the third element of the first line. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less line than before, as one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
