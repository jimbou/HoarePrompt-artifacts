Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 4, _ is 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before.**

The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to `n`, `p`, and `k`. It then initializes `S` to 0. The values of `T`, `MOD`, `_`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, and `ans` are not affected by this code snippet. The value of `S` is reset to 0. The value of `p` is updated to the input value, and `i` is set to this new value of `p`. The value of `C` is updated based on the new value of `n`. The values of `num` and `den` are updated based on the new values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. The value of `ans` is updated based on the new values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. The input is consumed by `p` lines.
