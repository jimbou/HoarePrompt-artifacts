Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, p is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before**

The code assigns the values of three integers from stdin to `n`, `p`, and `k`, respectively, reducing the number of lines in stdin by one. It then initializes `S` to 0. The values of `T`, `MOD`, and `_` remain unchanged.
