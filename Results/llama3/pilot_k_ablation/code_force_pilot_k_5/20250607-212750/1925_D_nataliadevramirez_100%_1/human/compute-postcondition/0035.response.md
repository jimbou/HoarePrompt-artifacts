The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If `p` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `p` is an integer and greater than or equal to 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `p` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.
State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, p is an integer and greater than 0, i is 0, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and ans is printed.**
