Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 3, `_` is 3, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer from the input, `p` is an integer and greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `C` is `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2, `num` is (`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), `den` is pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`), `ans` is ((`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`)) * pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`) % `MOD`, stdin contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before, and `ans` is printed.**

The code reads an integer from the input and adds it to the value of `S`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `S` is now increased by the third integer from the input. The other variables still have the same values as before. The stdin still contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before, and `ans` is still printed.
