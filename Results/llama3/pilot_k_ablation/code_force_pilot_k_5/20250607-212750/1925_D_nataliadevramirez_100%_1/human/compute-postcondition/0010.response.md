Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first four lines of the input, `p` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with three less lines than before**

In this output state, the value of `S` has been updated to include the third element of the fourth line of the input. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases with three less lines than before, indicating that one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
