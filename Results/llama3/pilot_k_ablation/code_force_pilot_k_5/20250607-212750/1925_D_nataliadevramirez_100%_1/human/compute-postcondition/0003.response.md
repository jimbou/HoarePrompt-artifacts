The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `p`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `p`. If `p` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `p` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0.

State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before, p must be greater than 0, i is 0**
