The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `p` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `p` must be greater than 3.
State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first three lines of the input, `p` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before**
