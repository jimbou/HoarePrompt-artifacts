To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(p):`. The objects involved are `i` and `p`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `p` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Since `p` is greater than 0, it remains the same.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first line of the input and 0, `p` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before**
