Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer from the input, `p` is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `p`, `C` is `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2, `num` is (`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), `den` is pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`), `ans` is ((`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`)) * pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`) % `MOD`, stdin contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before, and `ans` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `T` is still an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` remains 1000000007, `T` is still greater than 0, `_` is still 1, `n` and `k` are still integers, `S` has been increased by the third integer from the input for each iteration, `p` is now greater than or equal to 0 (since the loop may have executed 0 times), `i` is now equal to `p` (since the loop counter has reached the end), `C` is still `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2, `num` and `den` have been updated based on the final values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`, and `ans` is the final result of the calculation, which is printed.
