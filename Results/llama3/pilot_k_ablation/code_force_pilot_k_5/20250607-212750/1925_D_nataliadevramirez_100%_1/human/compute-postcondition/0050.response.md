The only variable in the loop head is variable _ and T, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than T, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 2, T is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again _ must be increased by 1 so _ is 3 and for the loop to execute again T must be greater than 3.
State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 3, _ is 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is the sum of the third element of all lines of the input, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and ans is printed.**
