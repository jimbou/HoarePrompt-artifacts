Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first `p` lines of the input, `p` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `p-1`, stdin contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `T`, `MOD`, `_`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. `S` is the sum of the third element of the first `p` lines of the input. `p` is greater than or equal to 0, and `i` is `p-1`. The number of lines in stdin is reduced by `p` compared to the initial state.
