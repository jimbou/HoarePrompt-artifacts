Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 0, _ is 2, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is the sum of the third element of all lines of the input, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and ans is printed.**

The final state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the variable S now holds the sum of the third element of all lines of the input. The variable i has reached the value of p, indicating that the loop has completed all its iterations. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values.
