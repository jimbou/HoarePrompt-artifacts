The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and p, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `p`. If `i` is less than `p`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `p` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again p must be greater than 4.
State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 4, `_` is 4, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `p` is an integer and greater than 4, `i` is 4, `C` is `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2, `num` is (`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), `den` is pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`), `ans` is ((`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`)) * pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`) % `MOD`, `S` is increased by the third integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before.**
