Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is increased by the third integer from the input, `p` is an integer and greater than 4, `i` is 4, `C` is `n` * (`n` - 1) // 2, `num` is (`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), `den` is pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`), `ans` is ((`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`) // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`)) * pow(2 * `C` * `C` // math.gcd(`p` * `k` * `k` - `p` * `k` + 2 * `k` * `C` * `S`, 2 * `C` * `C`), -1, `MOD`) % `MOD`, stdin contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before, and `ans` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `S` has been increased by the third integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged. The program has read one line from the input, so the number of lines in the input has decreased by one. The program is still in the state of printing the value of `ans`.
