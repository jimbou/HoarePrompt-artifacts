Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is increased by the third integer from the input, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and ans is printed.**

The code block modifies the values of `C`, `num`, `den`, and `ans`. The first line recalculates `C` as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is a new value based on the current value of `n`. The second line calculates `num` as `p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S`, which is a new value based on the current values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. The third line calculates `den` as `2 * C * C`, which is a new value based on the current value of `C`. The fourth line calculates the greatest common divisor `g` of `num` and `den` and divides both `num` and `den` by `g` to simplify the fraction. The fifth line calculates the modular multiplicative inverse of `den` modulo `MOD` and assigns it to `den`. The sixth line calculates `ans` as the product of `num` and `den` modulo `MOD`, which is the final result. The value of `ans` is printed, and the remaining test cases in stdin are processed with `p` less lines than before.
