Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T must be greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, p is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before
Code of the loop:
for i in range(p):
    S += int(input().split()[2])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first line of the input and 0, `p` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first two lines of the input, `p` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line than before

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first three lines of the input, `p` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first four lines of the input, `p` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases with three less lines than before

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first five lines of the input, `p` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
