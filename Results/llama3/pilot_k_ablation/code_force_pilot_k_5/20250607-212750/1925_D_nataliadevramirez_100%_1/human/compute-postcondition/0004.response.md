The code `S += int(input().split()[2])` accepts an input and splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. It then converts the third element of this list (index 2) to an integer and adds it to the value of `S`.

In the initial state, `S` is 0, and the stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before. This means that the first line of the input is being processed, and the third element of this line is being added to `S`.

Since the value of the third element is unknown, the output state will be an expression representing the new value of `S`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first line of the input and 0, `p` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before**
