Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than or equal to 0, _ is T, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is the sum of the third element of all lines of the input, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and the answer to the problem which is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD is being printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `_` is equal to `T`, which means the loop has executed `T` times. The values of `n`, `k`, `p`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, and `ans` are updated based on the last iteration of the loop. The value of `S` is the sum of the third element of all lines of the input. The value of `ans` is the solution to the problem, which is printed after each iteration. The input `stdin` contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before.
