Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, stdin contains multiple test cases with one less line than before
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(T):
    n, p, k = map(int, input().split())
    S = 0
    for i in range(p):
        S += int(input().split()[2])
    C = n * (n - 1) // 2
    num = p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S
    den = 2 * C * C
    g = math.gcd(num, den)
    num = num // g
    den = den // g
    den = pow(den, -1, MOD)
    ans = num * den % MOD
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is the sum of the third element of the first p lines of the input, p is greater than or equal to 0, i is p-1, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is increased by the third integer from the input, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 3, _ is 3, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is increased by the third integer from the input, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and the value of ans which is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 4, _ is 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, S is increased by the third integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and the answer to the problem which is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
