Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 4, _ is 4, n is an integer, k is an integer, p is an integer and greater than or equal to 0, i is p, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, S is increased by the third integer from the input, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before.**

The code block modifies the values of `C`, `num`, `den`, and `ans`. The variable `C` is recalculated as `n * (n - 1) // 2`, which is a new value based on the current value of `n`. The variable `num` is recalculated as `(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)`, which is a new value based on the current values of `p`, `k`, `C`, and `S`. The variable `den` is recalculated as `pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD)`, which is a new value based on the current values of `C` and `MOD`. The variable `ans` is recalculated as `((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD`, which is a new value based on the current values of `p`, `k`, `C`, `S`, and `MOD`. The variable `S` is increased by the third integer from the input for each iteration of the loop. The other variables remain unchanged.
