To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `p`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `p`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `p` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `p` is greater than 3, it must also be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, such as `T`, `MOD`, `n`, `k`, `S`, and the contents of `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first four lines of the input, `p` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases with three less lines than before**
