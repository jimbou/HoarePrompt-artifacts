Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, `MOD` is 1000000007, `T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `S` is the sum of the third element of the first three lines of the input, `p` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before**

In this output state, the value of `S` has been updated to include the third element of the third line of the input. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains multiple test cases with two less lines than before, indicating that one line has been consumed by the `input()` function.
