Output State: **T is an integer between 1 and 5 * 10^4, MOD is 1000000007, T is greater than 0, _ is 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, S is 0, p is an integer, i is p-1, C is n * (n - 1) // 2, num is (p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), den is pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD), ans is ((p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S) // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C)) * pow(2 * C * C // math.gcd(p * k * k - p * k + 2 * k * C * S, 2 * C * C), -1, MOD) % MOD, stdin contains multiple test cases with p less lines than before, and ans is printed**

The code reads three integers from the input: `n`, `p`, and `k`, and assigns them to the corresponding variables. The variable `S` is initialized to 0. The values of `T`, `MOD`, `_`, `i`, `C`, `num`, `den`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that it now contains multiple test cases with `p` less lines than before.
