According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 4 elements, water is the fourth element in the list a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the water is the fifth element in the list.
State: **The program either returns the string 'NO' if the calculated container value is less than 0, or it does not return anything if the container value is not less than 0, n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, total_water is the sum of a, target is the sum of a divided by n, water is the fifth element in the list a, and container is the previous value of container plus the difference between the fifth element in the list a and the sum of a divided by n.**
