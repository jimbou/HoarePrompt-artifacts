Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, and `container` is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is the introduction of a new variable `container` which is initialized to 0. The divisibility of `total_water` by `n` is still valid, and the relationship between `total_water` and `target` remains the same.
