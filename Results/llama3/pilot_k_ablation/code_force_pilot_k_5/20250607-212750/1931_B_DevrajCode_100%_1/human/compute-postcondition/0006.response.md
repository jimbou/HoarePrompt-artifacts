The code increments the value of `container` by the difference between `water` and `target`. Since `water` is the first element in the list `a` and `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, we can express `container` as `container` = `water` - `target` = `a[0]` - `total_water`/`n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[0]` - `total_water`/`n`, and `water` is the first element in the list `a`.**
