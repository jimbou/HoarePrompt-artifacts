Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `total_water` is divisible by `n`, and `container` is 0.
Code of the loop:
for water in a:
    container += water - target
    if container < 0:
        return 'NO'


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[0]` - `total_water`/`n`, and `water` is the first element in the list `a`. The value of `container` is larger or equal to 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n` + `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n`, and `water` is the second element in the list `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program either returns the string 'NO' if the calculated container value is less than 0, or it does not return anything if the container value is not less than 0, while maintaining the initial state of n as a positive integer, a as a list of n non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, total_water as the sum of a, target as the sum of a divided by n, and water as the third element in the list a.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The program either returns the string 'NO' if the calculated container value is less than 0, or it does not return anything if the container value is not less than 0, while maintaining the initial state of n as a positive integer, a as a list of n non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, total_water as the sum of a, target as the sum of a divided by n, water as the fourth element in the list a, and container as the previous value of container plus the difference between the fourth element in the list a and the sum of a divided by n.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *The program either returns the string 'NO' if the calculated container value is less than 0, or it does not return anything if the container value is not less than 0. The program maintains the initial state of the variables, where n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers with at least 5 elements, total_water is the sum of a, target is the sum of a divided by n, water is the fifth element in the list a, and container is the previous value of container plus the difference between the fifth element in the list a and the sum of a divided by n.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
