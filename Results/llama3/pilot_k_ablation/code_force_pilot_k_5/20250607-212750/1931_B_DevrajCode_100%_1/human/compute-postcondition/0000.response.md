Output State: **n is a positive integer, a is a list of n non-negative integers, total_water is the sum of a, target is the sum of a divided by n**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The list `a` also retains its original properties, consisting of `n` non-negative integers. The variable `total_water` is assigned the sum of all elements in list `a`, which is a specific numerical value. The variable `target` is calculated as the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, resulting in a specific numerical value as well.
