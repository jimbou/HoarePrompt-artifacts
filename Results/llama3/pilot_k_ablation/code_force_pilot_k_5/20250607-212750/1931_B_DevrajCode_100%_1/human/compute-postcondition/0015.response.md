Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n` + `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n` + `a[2]` - `total_water`/`n`, and `water` is the third element in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `container` has been updated by adding the difference between `water` and `target` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
