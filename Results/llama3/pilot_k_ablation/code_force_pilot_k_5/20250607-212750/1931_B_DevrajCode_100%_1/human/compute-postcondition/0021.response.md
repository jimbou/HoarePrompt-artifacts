Postcondition: **The program either returns the string 'NO' if the calculated container value is less than 0, or it does not return anything if the container value is not less than 0, while maintaining the initial state of n as a positive integer, a as a list of n non-negative integers with at least 4 elements, total_water as the sum of a, target as the sum of a divided by n, water as the fourth element in the list a, and container as the previous value of container plus the difference between the fourth element in the list a and the sum of a divided by n.**
