Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, and `container` is 0.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the initial state, with the exception that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `a`. The value of `container` is 0, indicating that the loop has successfully iterated over all elements in the list without returning 'NO'. The state of the other variables, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, and `target`, remains unchanged.
