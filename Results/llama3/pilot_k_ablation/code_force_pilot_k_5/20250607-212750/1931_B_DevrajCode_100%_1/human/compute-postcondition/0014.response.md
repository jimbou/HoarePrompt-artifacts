The only variable in the loop head is variable  water, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `water` is the second element in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `water` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 3 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n` + `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n`, and `water` is the third element in the list `a`.**
