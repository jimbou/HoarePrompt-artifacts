Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n` + `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n`, and `water` is the second element in the list `a`. The value of `container` is larger or equal to 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of elements in the list `a` is still a positive integer `n`. The list `a` still contains `n` non-negative integers with at least 2 elements. The total water is still the sum of all elements in the list `a`. The target is still the average of the elements in the list `a`. The container's capacity is increased by the difference between the amount of water it can hold and the target amount of water, and this difference is added to its initial capacity. The amount of water is still the second element in the list `a`. The container's capacity is still non-negative.
