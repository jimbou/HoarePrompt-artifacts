Postcondition: **The program either returns the string 'NO' if the calculated container value is less than 0, or it does not return anything if the container value is not less than 0, while maintaining the initial state of n as a positive integer, a as a list of n non-negative integers with at least 3 elements, total_water as the sum of a, target as the sum of a divided by n, and water as the third element in the list a.**
