Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers that must have at least 2 elements, `total_water` is the sum of `a`, `target` is the sum of `a` divided by `n`, `container` is `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n` + `a[1]` - `total_water`/`n`, and `water` is the second element in the list `a`. If `container` is less than 0, the program returns the string 'NO'. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
