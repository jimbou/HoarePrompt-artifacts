Reasoning: 
The given program is correct. It correctly determines if it is possible to distribute water evenly among n containers. The program first calculates the total amount of water and the target amount for each container. It then iterates over the list of water amounts, keeping track of the difference between the current container's water amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference is negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the function returns 'NO'. If the function iterates over the entire list without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly, so the function returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
