Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water each container should have. It then iterates through the list of water amounts, keeping track of the difference between the current container's water amount and the target amount. If at any point this difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the function returns 'NO'. If the function completes the iteration without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation, so it returns 'YES'.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the case where the total amount of water is not divisible by the number of containers (in which case it immediately returns 'NO'), and the case where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target amount (in which case it returns 'YES' without iterating through the list).
