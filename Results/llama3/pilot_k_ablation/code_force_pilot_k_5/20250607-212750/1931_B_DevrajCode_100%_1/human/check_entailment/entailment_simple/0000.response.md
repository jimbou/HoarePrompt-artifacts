Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `n` (the number of containers) and `a` (a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of water in each container). The function first calculates the total amount of water (`total_water`) and the target amount of water in each container (`target`) by dividing the total amount of water by the number of containers.

The function then checks if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, the function immediately returns 'NO', indicating that it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

If the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, the function iterates over the list of water amounts. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount (`water - target`). This difference is added to a running total (`container`).

If at any point the running total becomes negative, the function immediately returns 'NO', indicating that it's impossible to make the amount of water in all containers the same. This is because the running total represents the amount of water that needs to be poured from previous containers to the current container, and if this amount becomes negative, it means that there's not enough water in the previous containers to pour into the current container.

If the function iterates over the entire list of water amounts without returning 'NO', it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from previous containers to later containers. In this case, the function returns 'YES'.

Correctness: **True**
