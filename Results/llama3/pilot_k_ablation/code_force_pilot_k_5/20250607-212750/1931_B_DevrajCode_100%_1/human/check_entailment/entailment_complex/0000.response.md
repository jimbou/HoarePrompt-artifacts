Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments.

Here's why:

1. The program first checks if the total water is divisible by the number of containers. If it's not, it immediately returns 'NO', which is correct because it's impossible to distribute the water evenly in this case.

2. If the total water is divisible by the number of containers, the program calculates the target amount of water each container should have.

3. The program then iterates over the list of containers. For each container, it calculates the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. It adds this difference to a running total `container`.

4. If at any point the running total `container` becomes negative, the program immediately returns 'NO'. This is correct because it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount.

5. If the program finishes iterating over all containers without returning 'NO', it means that it is possible to distribute the water evenly among all containers. In this case, the program returns 'YES'.

Therefore, the program correctly determines whether it is possible to distribute water evenly among n containers, given a list of n non-negative integers representing the amount of water in each container.

Correctness: **True**
