Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the maximum total difference D that can be obtained by arranging the elements of list b to be as different as possible from the elements of list a. 

The program first sorts both lists a and b. Then, it uses two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of each list, to compare the absolute differences between the corresponding elements. It chooses the maximum difference at each step and adds it to the total difference D. 

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including when the maximum difference is obtained by comparing the smallest element of a with the smallest or largest element of b, or the largest element of a with the smallest or largest element of b. 

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the maximum total difference D that can be obtained.

Correctness: **True**
