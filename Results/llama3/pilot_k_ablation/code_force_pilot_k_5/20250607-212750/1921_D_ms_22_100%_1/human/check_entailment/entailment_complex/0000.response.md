Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. 

The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements in the sorted lists a and b, and prints this sum for each test case. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been read.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. The use of two pointers, a1 and a2, to traverse the sorted list a from both ends, and the use of two pointers, b1 and b2, to traverse the sorted list b from both ends, is a clever approach to find the maximum absolute differences. The program also correctly handles the cases where the maximum absolute difference is obtained by comparing an element from the start of list a with an element from the start of list b, an element from the start of list a with an element from the end of list b, an element from the end of list a with an element from the start of list b, or an element from the end of list a with an element from the end of list b.

Therefore, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for the given input.

Correctness: **True**
