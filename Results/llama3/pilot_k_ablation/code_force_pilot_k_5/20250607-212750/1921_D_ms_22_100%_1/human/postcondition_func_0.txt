This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: two integers n and m, followed by n integers a_i and m integers b_i. It then calculates the sum of the maximum absolute differences between corresponding elements in the sorted lists a and b, and prints this sum for each test case. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been read.
