Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is the next index in list a, b1 is the next index in list b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1] before a1 and b1 were incremented, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1] before a1 and b1 were incremented, dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

The code increments `ans` by the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, then increments `a1` and `b1` by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The value of `stdin` is also unchanged as no input operations are performed.
