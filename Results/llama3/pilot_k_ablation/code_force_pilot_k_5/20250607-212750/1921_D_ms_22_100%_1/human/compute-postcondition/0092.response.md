Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is an integer equal to its original value plus one, b1 is an integer equal to its original value plus one, dif1 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b2th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `a1` and `b1` are incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is increased by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the `a1th` element of `a` and the `b1th` element of `b`. The value of `stdin` remains the same as it is not affected by the code.
