Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If dif4 > dif2, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, a1 is one more than its current value, and b2 is one less than its current value.**
