The only variable in the loop head is variable a1 and a2, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable a1 and a2.  If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a2 is greater than or equal to a1, So for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than a2.
State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1.**
