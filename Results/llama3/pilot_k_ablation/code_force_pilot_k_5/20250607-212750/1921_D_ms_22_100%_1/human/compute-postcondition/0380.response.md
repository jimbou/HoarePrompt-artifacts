Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly.***
