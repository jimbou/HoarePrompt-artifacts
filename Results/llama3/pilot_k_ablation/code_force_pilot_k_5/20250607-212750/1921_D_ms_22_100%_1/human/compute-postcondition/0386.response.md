Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1.**

The code modifies the values of `ans`, `a2`, and `b2`. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b2]`. The values of `a2` and `b2` are both decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
