Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is less than or equal to a2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1.***
