Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2, a1 must be less than a2 initially, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif2, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1]. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1.**
