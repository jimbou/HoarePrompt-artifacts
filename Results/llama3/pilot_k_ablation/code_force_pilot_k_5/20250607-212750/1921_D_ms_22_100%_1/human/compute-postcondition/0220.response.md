Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, if dif3 > dif1, then a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is dif3, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, and stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**
