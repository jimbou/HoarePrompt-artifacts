The variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a2 is greater than a1. For the loop to be executed one more time, a1 must be less than a2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. a1 must be less than a2.**
