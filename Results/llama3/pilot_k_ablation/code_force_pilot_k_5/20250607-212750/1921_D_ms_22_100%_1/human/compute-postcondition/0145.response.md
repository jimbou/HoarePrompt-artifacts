Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. It also increments `a1` and `b1` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `stdin`, `a2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.
