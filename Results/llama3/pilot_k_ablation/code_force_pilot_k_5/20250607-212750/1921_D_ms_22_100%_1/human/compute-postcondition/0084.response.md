Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the element at index a1 in list a and the element at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the element at index a1 in list a and the element at index b2 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the element at index a2 in list a and the element at index b1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the element at index a2 in list a and the element at index b2 in list b. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1.**
