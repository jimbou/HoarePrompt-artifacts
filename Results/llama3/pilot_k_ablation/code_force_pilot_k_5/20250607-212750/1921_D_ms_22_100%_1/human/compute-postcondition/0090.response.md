Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif3 is larger than dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, b1 is one more than its original value, and ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b.***
