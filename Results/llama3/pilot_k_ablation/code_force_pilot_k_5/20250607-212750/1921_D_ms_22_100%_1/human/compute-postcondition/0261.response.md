Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a1 is one less than its current value, a2 is at least 2 more than its original value**
