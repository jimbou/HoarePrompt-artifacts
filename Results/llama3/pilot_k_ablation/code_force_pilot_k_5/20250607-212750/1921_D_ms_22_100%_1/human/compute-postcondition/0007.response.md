Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, ans is 0, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. The current value of dif1 is greater than the current value of dif2. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4***
