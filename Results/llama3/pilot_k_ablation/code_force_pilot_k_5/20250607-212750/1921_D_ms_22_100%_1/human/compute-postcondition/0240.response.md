Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either dif4 or dif2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and the last or second last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. The absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and the last or second last element of b. If dif4 is greater than dif2, then a2 is n - 2, b2 is m - 2, ans is dif4. Otherwise, a1 is 1, b2 is m - 2, ans is dif2.***
