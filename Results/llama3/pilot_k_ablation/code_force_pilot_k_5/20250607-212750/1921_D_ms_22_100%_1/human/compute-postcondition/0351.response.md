Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than or equal to a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b. If dif3 is greater than dif1, then ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1.**
