The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `a[a2]` and `b[b2]` for all iterations of the loop.

Since `a1` is equal to `a2`, the absolute differences between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`, `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`, `a[a2]` and `b[b2]` are the same for all iterations of the loop.

The maximum of these absolute differences is the maximum of the absolute differences between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.

The sum of these maximum absolute differences is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, `a[a1]` and `b[b2]` for all iterations of the loop.

Output: **The sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop (where a1 is equal to a2)**
