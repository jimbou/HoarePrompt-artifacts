Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, a2 is one less than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, a1 is increased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, a2 is one less than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is increased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1.***
