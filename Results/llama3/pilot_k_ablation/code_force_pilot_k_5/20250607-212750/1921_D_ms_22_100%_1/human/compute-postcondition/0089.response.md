Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is one more than its original value, b1 is one more than its original value, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are no longer valid as a1 and b1 have changed.**
