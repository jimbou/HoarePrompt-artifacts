Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a1 is either equal to its current value plus two or its current value, a2 is either decreased by 1 or at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value, a1 must be less than or equal to a2, ans is increased by dif2, b2 is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been increased by `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of `a` and the last element of `b`. The value of `a1` has been increased by 1, and the value of `b2` has been decreased by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The value of `a2` is either decreased by 1 or at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value. The value of `a1` is either equal to its current value plus two or its current value, and it must be less than or equal to `a2`.
