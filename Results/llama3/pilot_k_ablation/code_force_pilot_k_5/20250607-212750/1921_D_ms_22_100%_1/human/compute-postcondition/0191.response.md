Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

The code snippet calculates the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b` at specific indices (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`). The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly. No other variables are affected by this code block.
