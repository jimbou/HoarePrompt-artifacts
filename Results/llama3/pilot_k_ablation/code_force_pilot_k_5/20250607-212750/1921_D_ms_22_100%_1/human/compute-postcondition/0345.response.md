Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif2, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is dif2, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is equal to the original value of dif2, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. In all cases, the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b.***
