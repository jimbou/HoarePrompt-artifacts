Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1-1)th element of a and the (b1-1)th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1-1)th element of a and the b2th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the (b1-1)th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b, ans is the sum of the original value of ans and dif1**
