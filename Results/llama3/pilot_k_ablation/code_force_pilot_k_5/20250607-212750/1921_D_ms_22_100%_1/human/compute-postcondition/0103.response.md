Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is n, a2 is n - 1, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b, b1 is m, and b2 is m - 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables a1 and a2 have reached the end of the list a, and the variable ans has accumulated the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b. The variables b1 and b2 have also reached the end of the list b. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
