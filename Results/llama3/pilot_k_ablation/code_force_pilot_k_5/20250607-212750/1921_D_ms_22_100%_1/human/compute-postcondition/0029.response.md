Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the original value of dif4, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the second last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code increments the value of `ans` by the original value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the last element of `b`. It then decrements the value of `a2` by 1, making it `n - 2`, and decrements the value of `b2` by 1. The values of `dif2` and `dif4` are updated as the last elements of `a` and `b` are now the second last elements. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
