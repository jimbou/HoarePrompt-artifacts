Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, ans is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b minus 1, and b1 is 1. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then a2 is n - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, and dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the last element of b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, ans is equal to the original value of the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, and dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. If the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, and b1 is 1. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, then a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, and dif4 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the second last element of b. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, and b2 is m - 2.***
