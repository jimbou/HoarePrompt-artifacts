Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is less than or equal to a2. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1, otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the element at index a1 in list a and the element at index b1 in list b, a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1.**
