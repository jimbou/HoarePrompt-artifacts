Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif2, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 3 or n - 2, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, and ans is increased by the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b2th element of b. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b, and a2 is either n - 3 or n - 2. Otherwise, ans is the sum of its original value and dif2, and a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 1.**
