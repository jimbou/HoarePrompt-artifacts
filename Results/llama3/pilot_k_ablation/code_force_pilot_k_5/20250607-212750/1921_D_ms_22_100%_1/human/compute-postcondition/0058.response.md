Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is one more than its original value and is less than or equal to a2, b1 is one more than its original value, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1-1] and b[b1-1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1-1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1-1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is the sum of its original value and dif1.**
