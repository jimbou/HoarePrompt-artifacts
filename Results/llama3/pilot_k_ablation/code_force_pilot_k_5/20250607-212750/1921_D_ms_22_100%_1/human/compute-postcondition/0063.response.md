Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif3 > dif2, then ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1, and ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2] before the increment and decrement.**
