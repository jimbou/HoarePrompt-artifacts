Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. If dif3 > dif4, then either a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus dif3, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly, or a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of dif1, and dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, then either a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus dif4, or a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. In all cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed.***
