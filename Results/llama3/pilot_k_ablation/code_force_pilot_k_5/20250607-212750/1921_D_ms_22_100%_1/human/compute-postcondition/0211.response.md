Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three**.

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1. The values of n and m have been updated based on the input from stdin. The lists a and b have been sorted in ascending order. The variables a1, a2, b1, and b2 have been initialized to specific indices. The variable ans has been initialized to 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus three.
