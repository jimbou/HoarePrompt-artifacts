Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b2th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b, ans is the sum of its original value and dif2.**

Explanation: The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `a1`, and `b2`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the `a1`th element of `a` and the `b2`th element of `b`. The second line increments `a1` by 1, changing its value to either 1 or 2. The third line decrements `b2` by 1, but its exact value is not specified. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.
