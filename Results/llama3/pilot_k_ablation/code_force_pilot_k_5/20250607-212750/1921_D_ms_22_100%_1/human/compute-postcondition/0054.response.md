Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `a2`, and `b1`. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. The value of `a2` is decreased by 1, and the value of `b1` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
