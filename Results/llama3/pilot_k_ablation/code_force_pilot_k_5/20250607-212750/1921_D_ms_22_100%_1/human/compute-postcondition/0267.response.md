Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If dif4 > dif1, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is one more than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and a1 is one less than its current value. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, b1 is increased by 1, and a1 is equal to its current value.***
