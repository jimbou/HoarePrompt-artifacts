Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed.**

The code adds the value of `dif1` to `ans`, increments `a1` and `b1` by 1, and updates the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` based on the new values of `a1` and `b1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a2`, `b2`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
