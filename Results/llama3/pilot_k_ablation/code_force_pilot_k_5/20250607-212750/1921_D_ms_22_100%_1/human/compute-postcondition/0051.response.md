Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by either the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b or the absolute difference between the (a1-1)th element of a and the (b1-1)th element of b, and a1 and a2 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is increased by either dif1 or dif4 depending on whether dif4 is greater than dif1, and a1 and a2 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by either the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b or the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b2th element of b, and a1, a2, and b1 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is increased by either the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b or dif2, and a1 and a2 are updated accordingly.***
