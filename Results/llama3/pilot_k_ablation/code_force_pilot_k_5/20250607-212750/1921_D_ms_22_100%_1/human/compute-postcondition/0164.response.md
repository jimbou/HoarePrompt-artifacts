Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is the next index in list a, b1 is the next index in list b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1] before a1 and b1 were incremented.**
