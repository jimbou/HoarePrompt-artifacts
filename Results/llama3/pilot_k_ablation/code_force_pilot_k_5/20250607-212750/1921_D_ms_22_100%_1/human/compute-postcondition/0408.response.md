Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is the next index in the list a, b2 is the previous index in the list b, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2 + 1], ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1].**

The code modifies the values of `a1`, `b2`, and `ans`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`. The second line increments `a1` by 1, making it point to the next index in the list `a`. The third line decrements `b2` by 1, making it point to the previous index in the list `b`. The values of `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are not directly modified by the code, but their values change due to the changes in `a1` and `b2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
