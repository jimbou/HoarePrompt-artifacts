Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b2th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b.**

The code calculates the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b` at specific indices (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) and assigns these differences to variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. The initial state of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `stdin` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify these variables. The only changes are the introduction of new variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, which hold the calculated absolute differences.
