Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than or equal to a2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, and the corresponding indices a2, b2 are updated. Otherwise, a1 is the next index in a, b1 is the next index in b, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a2, b1 are updated. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, and the corresponding indices a2, b2 are updated. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2.**
