Output State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and stdin contains no input. The absolute difference between the first elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif2.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`. Then, it decrements `a2` by 1, effectively moving the end index of `a` one step to the left. Finally, it increments `b1` by 1, effectively moving the start index of `b` one step to the right. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a1`, `b2`, `dif1`, `dif2`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.
