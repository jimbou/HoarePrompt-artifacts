Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than or equal to a1 + 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2 - 1], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a1 + 1] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2 - 1], ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2].**

The code increments `ans` by `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. It then increments `a1` by 1 and decrements `b2` by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `t`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The value of `a1` is now one more than its original value, and the value of `b2` is now one less than its original value. The value of `ans` is increased by the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`.
