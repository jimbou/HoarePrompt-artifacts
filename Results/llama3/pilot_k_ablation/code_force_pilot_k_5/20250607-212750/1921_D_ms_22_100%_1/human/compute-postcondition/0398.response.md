To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `a1` and `a2` since they are the variables in the loop head.

According to the code, the loop can execute again if `a1` is less than or equal to `a2`. At the end of the last iteration, `a2` is greater than `a1`. To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust `a1` to be less than or equal to `a2`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than or equal to a2**
