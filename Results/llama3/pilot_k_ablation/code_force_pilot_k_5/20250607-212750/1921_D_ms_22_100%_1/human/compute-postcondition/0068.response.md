Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1, and ans is increased by dif1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1, and ans is increased by dif2.**
