Output State: **t is 0, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains no test cases, a1 is equal to a2, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop, and the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the variable t becomes 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variables n and m remain integers within the specified range, and the lists a and b remain sorted lists of integers within the specified range. The standard input (stdin) is empty, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The variables a1 and a2 are equal, indicating that the inner while loop has finished executing. The variable ans contains the sum of the maximum absolute differences between the elements of a and b for all iterations of the loop, and this sum is printed as the output.
