Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif1, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 3 or n - 2, ans is the sum of its original value and dif3, and b1 is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, a1 is either 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 2 or n - 1, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the (a1-1)th element of a and the (b1-1)th element of b. If dif3 <= dif4, a1 is either 0, 1 or 2, a2 is either n - 3, n - 2 or n - 1, ans is the sum of the original value of ans and either dif1 or dif4 depending on whether dif4 is greater than dif1.***
