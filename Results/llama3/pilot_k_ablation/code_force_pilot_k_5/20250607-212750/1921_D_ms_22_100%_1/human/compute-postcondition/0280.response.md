Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the last element of b, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is one more than its current value, b1 is one more than its current value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the `a1`th element of `a` and the first element of `b`. Then, it increments `a1` and `b1` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus three.
