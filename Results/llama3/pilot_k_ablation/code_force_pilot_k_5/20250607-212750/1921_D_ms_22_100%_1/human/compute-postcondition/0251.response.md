Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif1, ans is the sum of its original value and dif3, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, a1 is increased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, a2 is one less than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, a1 is increased by 1, b1 is increased by 1.**
