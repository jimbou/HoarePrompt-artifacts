Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of t, n, m, a, b, a1, dif1, dif2, and dif3 remain unchanged. The value of ans is increased by dif4, which is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. The values of a2 and b2 are decremented by 1.
