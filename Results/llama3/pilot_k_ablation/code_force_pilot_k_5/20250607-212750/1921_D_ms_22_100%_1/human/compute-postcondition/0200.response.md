Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is an integer greater than its original value, b2 is an integer less than its original value, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2 + 1], ans is an integer greater than its original value by the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1].**

In this final state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The values of `n` and `m` also remain the same as they are not affected by the code. The lists `a` and `b` are also unchanged as the code does not modify them.

The value of `a1` is incremented by 1, making it greater than its original value. The value of `b2` is decremented by 1, making it less than its original value.

The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new values of `a1` and `b2`. `dif1` is now the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b1]`, `dif2` is now the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`, `dif3` is now the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`, and `dif4` is now the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`.

The value of `ans` is incremented by the absolute difference between `a[a1 - 1]` and `b[b2 + 1]`, making it greater than its original value.

The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same as the code does not modify it.
