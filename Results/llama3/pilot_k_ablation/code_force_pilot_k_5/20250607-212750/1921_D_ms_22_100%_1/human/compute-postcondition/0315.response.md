Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of t has decreased by 1. The values of n and m have been updated to the input values. The lists a and b have been sorted in ascending order. The indices a1 and a2 now point to the first and last elements of list a, respectively. Similarly, the indices b1 and b2 now point to the first and last elements of list b, respectively. The variable ans has been initialized to 0. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus four. The sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed.
