To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `t > 0`. Since `t` is already an integer larger than 0, no adjustments are needed to the state of `t` or any other variables for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **The program is being run as the main module, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). `t` is an integer larger than 0.**
