Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the element at index a1 in list a and the element at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the element at index a1 in list a and the element at index b2 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the element at index a2 in list a and the element at index b2 in list b, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1.**
