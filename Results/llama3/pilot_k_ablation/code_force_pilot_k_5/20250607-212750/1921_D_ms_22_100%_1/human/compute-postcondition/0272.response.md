Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the last element of b, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is one less than its current value, b2 is one less than its current value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a1 is one less than its current value.**

The code block modifies the values of `ans`, `a2`, and `b2`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the `(a2+2)`th element of `a` and the last element of `b`. The second line decrements `a2` by 1, making it one less than its current value. The third line decrements `b2` by 1, making it one less than its current value. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `a1` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` also remains unchanged.
