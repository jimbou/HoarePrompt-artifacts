Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. The absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif4 is greater than dif2.***
