Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`, and `ans` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces four new variables: `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, which are assigned the absolute differences between specific elements of lists `a` and `b`. The state of `stdin` is also updated to reflect that three test cases have been processed.
