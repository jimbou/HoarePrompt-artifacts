Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is one more than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1-1)th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1-1)th element of a and the (b2+1)th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the (b2+1)th element of b, ans is the sum of its original value and dif2.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the `(a1-1)`th element of `a` and the `(b2+1)`th element of `b`. Then, it increments `a1` by 1 and decrements `b2` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `dif2` to its original value.
