Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is the next index in list a, b1 is the next index in list b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1] before a1 and b1 were incremented. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], and b2 is decreased by 1.**
