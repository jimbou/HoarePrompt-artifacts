Output State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and stdin contains no input. The current value of dif1 is greater than the current value of dif2. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b. The absolute difference between the last elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second elements of a and b.**
