Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is an integer where a2 >= a1 - 1, b2 is an integer where b2 >= b1 - 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif4.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `dif4` to its original value. The values of `a2` and `b2` have been decremented by 1, but their relationships with `a1` and `b1` remain valid. All other variables and conditions from the initial state remain unchanged.
