According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.

State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is n, a2 is n - 1, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b, b1 is m, and b2 is m - 1, and the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b which is ans is being printed**
