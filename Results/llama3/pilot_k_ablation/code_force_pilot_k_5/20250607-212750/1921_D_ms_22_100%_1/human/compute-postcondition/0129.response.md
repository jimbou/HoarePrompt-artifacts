Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second last element of b. The absolute difference between the second element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second last element of b. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4. Additionally, dif3 is less than or equal to dif2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to the original value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`. The value of `a1` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `b2` has been decremented by 1. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` have been updated accordingly, based on the new values of `a1` and `b2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
