Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: The program is being run as the main module, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). `t` is an integer larger than 0.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a1 = 0
    a2 = n - 1
    b1 = 0
    b2 = m - 1
    ans = 0
    b.sort()
    a.sort()
    while a1 <= a2:
        dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
        dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
        dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
        dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
        if dif1 > dif2:
            if dif3 > dif4:
                if dif3 > dif1:
                    ans += dif3
                    a2 -= 1
                    b1 += 1
                else:
                    ans += dif1
                    a1 += 1
                    b1 += 1
            elif dif4 > dif1:
                ans += dif4
                a2 -= 1
                b2 -= 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif2:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif2
                a1 += 1
                b2 -= 1
        elif dif4 > dif2:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is n, a2 is n - 1, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b, b1 is m, and b2 is m - 1, and the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b which is ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and b, and the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and b which is ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is n, a2 is -1, b1 is m, b2 is -1, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is equal to a2, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b which is ans is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is equal to a2, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop, and the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
