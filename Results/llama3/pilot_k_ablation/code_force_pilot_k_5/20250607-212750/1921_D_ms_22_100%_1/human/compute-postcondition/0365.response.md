Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

The code calculates the absolute differences between elements of lists `a` and `b` at specific indices (`a1`, `a2`, `b1`, `b2`) and assigns these differences to variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `a2`, `b1`, and `b2` remain unchanged.
