Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. Depending on the values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4, the values of a1, a2, b1, b2, and ans are updated accordingly, and the absolute differences between the elements of a and b are recalculated.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than or equal to a1. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and either a2 is decremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and either a2 is decremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than or equal to a2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and the corresponding indices a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, and the corresponding indices a2, b2 are updated. Otherwise, a1 is the next index in a, b1 is the next index in b, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and the corresponding indices a2, b1 are updated. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, and the corresponding indices a2, b2 are updated. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
