The code prints the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of lists `a` and `b`. This sum is calculated as the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements at indices `a1` and `a2` in list `a` and the elements at indices `b1` and `b2` in list `b`. Since `a1` is equal to `a2`, the absolute differences `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are calculated between the same elements in list `a` and different elements in list `b`. The maximum of these absolute differences is summed up to obtain the final answer `ans`.

Output: **the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of lists a and b**
