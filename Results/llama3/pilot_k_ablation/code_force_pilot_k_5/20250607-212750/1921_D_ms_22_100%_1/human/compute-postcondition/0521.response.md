Output: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is equal to a2, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop, and the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop is printed**
