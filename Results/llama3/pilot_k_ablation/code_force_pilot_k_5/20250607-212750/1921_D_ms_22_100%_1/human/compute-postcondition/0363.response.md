Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than or equal to a1. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1.***
