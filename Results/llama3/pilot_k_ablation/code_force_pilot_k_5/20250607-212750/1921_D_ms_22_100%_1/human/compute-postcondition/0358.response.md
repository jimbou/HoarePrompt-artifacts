Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 must be greater than or equal to a1. If dif3 > dif2, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, a1 is increased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1.**
