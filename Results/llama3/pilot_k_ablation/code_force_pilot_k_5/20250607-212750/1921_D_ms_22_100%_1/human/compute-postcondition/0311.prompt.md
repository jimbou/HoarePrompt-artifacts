Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, a1 and a2 are either 0 and n - 2 or 1 and n - 1, b1 is 1 and b2 is m - 1, ans is either dif3 or the original value of dif1. If dif3 <= dif4, then a1 and a2 are either 0 and n - 2 or 1 and n - 1, b1 is 1 and b2 is m - 1, ans is either dif4 or the original value of dif1. If dif1 <= dif2, then a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 1 or n - 2, b1 is 0 and b2 is either m - 1 or m - 2, ans is either dif4 or dif2. The absolute difference between the first or second elements of a and b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first or second element of a and the last or second last element of b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last elements of a and the last or second last element of b. In all cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, a2 is one less than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, a1 is increased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, a2 is one less than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is increased by the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is increased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1.

If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif3, a2 is at least 2 more than its original value minus one if dif3 > dif1, otherwise a1 is equal to its current value, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif4, a2 is one more than its original value if dif4 > dif1, b2 is one less than its original value, and a1 is one less than its current value if dif4 > dif1, otherwise b1 is increased by 1 and a1 is equal to its current value. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif2 and dif3, a2 is decreased by 1 if dif3 > dif2, otherwise a1 is reset to its original value and b2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif2. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif4 if dif4 > dif2, otherwise ans is increased by dif2, b2 is one less than its current value if dif4 <= dif2.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
