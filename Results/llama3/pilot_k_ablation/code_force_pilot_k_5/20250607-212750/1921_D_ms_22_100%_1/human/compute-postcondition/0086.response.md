The only variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is less than or equal to a2. So for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than a2.
State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 must be less than a2**
