Output State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, ans is dif3, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first elements of a and b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last elements of a and b, and stdin contains no input. The current value of dif1 is greater than the current value of dif2. Additionally, the current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be equal to `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between the last element of `a` and the first element of `b`. The value of `a2` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `b1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are still satisfied.
