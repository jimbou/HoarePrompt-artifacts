Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 3 or n - 2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b2th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, a2 is either n - 3 or n - 2, b1 is increased by 1.**

The code executes three lines. The first line increases the value of `ans` by the absolute difference between the `a2`th element of `a` and the `b1`th element of `b`, which is `dif3`. The second line decrements `a2` by 1, changing its value to either `n - 3` or `n - 2`. The third line increments `b1` by 1. No other variables are affected.
