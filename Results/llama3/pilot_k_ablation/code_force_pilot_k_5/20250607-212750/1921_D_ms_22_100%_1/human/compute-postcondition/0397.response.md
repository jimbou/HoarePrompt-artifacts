Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and either a2 is decremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and either a2 is decremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1.**
