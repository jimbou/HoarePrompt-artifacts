Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is the next index in list a, b1 is the next index in list b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

The code snippet increments `ans` by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b1]`. It then increments `a1` and `b1` by 1, effectively moving to the next index in both lists `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `t`, `a`, `b`, `a2`, `b2`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged.
