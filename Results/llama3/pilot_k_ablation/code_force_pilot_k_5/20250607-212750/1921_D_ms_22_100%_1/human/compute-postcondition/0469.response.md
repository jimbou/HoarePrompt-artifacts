Output State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, and `a2` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces new variables `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4`, which are assigned the absolute differences between specific elements of lists `a` and `b` based on the indices `a1` and `a2`.
