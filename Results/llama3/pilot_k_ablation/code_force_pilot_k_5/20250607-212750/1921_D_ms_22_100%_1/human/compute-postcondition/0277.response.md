The variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is equal to its current value or one less than its current value, and a2 is at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value or decreased by 1. For the loop to be executed one more time, a1 must be less than or equal to a2. So, a2 must be at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value if a1 is one less than its current value, otherwise a1 must be equal to its current value and a2 must be decreased by 1.

State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a1 is equal to its current value and a2 is decreased by 1 or a1 is one less than its current value and a2 is at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value**
