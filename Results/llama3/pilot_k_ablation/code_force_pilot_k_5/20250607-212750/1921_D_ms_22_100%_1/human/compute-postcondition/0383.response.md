Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is increased by `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. The value of `a2` is decremented by 1, and the value of `b1` is incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
