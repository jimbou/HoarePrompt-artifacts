Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif3 > dif2, then ans is the sum of the original value of ans and dif3, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif2.**
