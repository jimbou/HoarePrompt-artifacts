Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, ans is 0, b1 is 0, and b2 is m - 1.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is updated based on the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, ans is updated based on the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the last element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is updated based on the original value of the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, ans is updated based on the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, ans is updated based on the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is updated based on the original value of dif2, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1.

If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is the next index in list a, b1 is the next index in list b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1] before a1 and b1 were incremented. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
