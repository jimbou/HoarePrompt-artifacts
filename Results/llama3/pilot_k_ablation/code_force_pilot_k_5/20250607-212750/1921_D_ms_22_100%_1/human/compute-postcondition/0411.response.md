Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than or equal to a1 + 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a1 + 1] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a1 + 1] and b[b2 - 1], ans is increased by dif2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `n` and `m` also remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The lists `a` and `b` remain sorted, but the indices `a1` and `b2` are updated. The differences `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated based on the new values of `a1` and `b2`. The variable `ans` is increased by the value of `dif2`.
