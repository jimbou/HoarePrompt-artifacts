Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1 if dif1 >= dif3. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif2, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if dif4 > dif2, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1.**
