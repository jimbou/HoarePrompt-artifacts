Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, ans is equal to the original value of dif1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif1 is greater than the current value of dif2. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the second element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b.**

The code increments `ans` by the value of `dif1`, which is the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the first element of `b`. It then increments `a1` and `b1` by 1. As a result, `a1` and `b1` now point to the second elements of `a` and `b`, respectively. The values of `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif3`, and `dif4` are updated accordingly, with `dif1` now being the absolute difference between the second elements of `a` and `b`, and so on. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
