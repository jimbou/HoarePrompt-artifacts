Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. The absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif4. The current value of dif3 is greater than the current value of dif2.**
