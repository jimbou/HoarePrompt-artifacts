The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0 and t must be larger than 2 but two less than its original value.
State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and b, and the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between the elements of a and b which is ans is being printed**
