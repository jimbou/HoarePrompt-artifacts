Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, ans is 0, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b. The current value of dif1 is greater than the current value of dif2. The absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b.**
