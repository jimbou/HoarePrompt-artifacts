Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 is larger than dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif4 is larger than dif1, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, b1 is one more than its original value, and ans is the original value of ans plus the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, if dif3 > dif2, ans is the sum of the original value of ans and dif3, a2 is one less than its original value, and b1 is one more than its original value. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif2. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif2.**
