Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. If dif3 > dif1, then a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, ans is dif3, b1 is 1, and dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b minus 1. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, ans is dif1, and dif1 is the absolute difference between the second element of a and the second element of b. In both cases, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
