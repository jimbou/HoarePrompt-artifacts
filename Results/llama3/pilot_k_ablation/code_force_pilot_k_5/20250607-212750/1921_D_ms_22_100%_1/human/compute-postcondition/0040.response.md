Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is either 0 or 1, a2 is either n - 3 or n - 2, dif1 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the a1th element of a and the b2th element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b1th element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the a2th element of a and the b2th element of b, ans is the sum of the original value of ans and dif4.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `dif4` to its original value. The value of `a2` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `b2` has also been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
