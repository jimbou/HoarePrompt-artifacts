Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1. If dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1] if dif3 > dif2, otherwise ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1 if dif3 <= dif2. If dif3 <= dif4, if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1.**
