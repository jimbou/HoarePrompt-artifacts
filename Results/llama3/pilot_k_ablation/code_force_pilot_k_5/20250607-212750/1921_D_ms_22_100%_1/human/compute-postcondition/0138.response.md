Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is updated based on the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, ans is updated based on the absolute difference between the second last element of a and the last element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is updated based on the original value of the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, ans is updated based on the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. If the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is greater than the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, ans is updated based on the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is updated based on the original value of dif2, and a1, a2, b1, b2, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are updated accordingly.***
