Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1+1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2+2)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif3, a2 is at least 2 more than its original value minus one if dif3 > dif1, otherwise a1 is equal to its current value, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif4, a2 is one more than its original value if dif4 > dif1, b2 is one less than its original value, and a1 is one less than its current value if dif4 > dif1, otherwise b1 is increased by 1 and a1 is equal to its current value. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif2 and dif3, a2 is decreased by 1 if dif3 > dif2, otherwise a1 is reset to its original value and b2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif2. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif4 if dif4 > dif2, otherwise ans is increased by dif2, b2 is one less than its current value if dif4 <= dif2.***
