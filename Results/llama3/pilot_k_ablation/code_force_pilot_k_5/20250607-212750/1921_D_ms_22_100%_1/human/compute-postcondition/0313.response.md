Output: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is n, a2 is -1, b1 is m, b2 is -1, ans is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed**
