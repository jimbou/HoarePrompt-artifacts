Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif3, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif4, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif2 and dif3, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif2 and dif4, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1.**
