Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of n and m also remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The lists a and b are also unchanged as the code does not modify their elements. The stdin remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The values of a1, a2, b1, and b2 are updated according to the code. The value of ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1]. The value of a2 is decreased by 1, and the value of b1 is increased by 1.
