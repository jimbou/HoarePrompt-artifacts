Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. The sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. Depending on the values of dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4, the values of a1, a2, b1, b2, and ans are updated accordingly, and the absolute differences between the elements of a and b are recalculated.**
