Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif1, otherwise a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1 if dif4 > dif1, otherwise a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif2, otherwise ans is increased by dif2, a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1 if dif4 > dif2, otherwise ans is increased by dif2, a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1.**
