Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than or equal to a2. If dif3 > dif2, then ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2-1] and b[b1], and dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2-1] and b[b2]. Otherwise, a1 is the next index in the list a, b2 is the previous index in the list b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1], dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1 - 1] and b[b2 + 1], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], and dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2 + 1].**
