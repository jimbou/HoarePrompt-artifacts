Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1, a2, b1, b2 are integers, ans is the original value of ans plus either dif1 or dif4, dif1, dif2, dif3, dif4 are integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four, and the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b is printed. If dif4 > dif1, then a1 is 0, a2 is n - 2, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 2, and ans is the original value of ans plus dif4. Otherwise, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 1, b2 is m - 1, and ans is the original value of ans plus the original value of dif1. In both cases, the current value of dif1 is greater than the current value of dif2, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b.***
