Postcondition: ***stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). If the program is run as the main module, then t is 0, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains no test cases, a1 is equal to a2, ans is the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop, and the sum of the maximum of the absolute differences between a[a1] and b[b1], a[a1] and b[b2], a[a2] and b[b1], a[a2] and b[b2] for all iterations of the loop is printed.***
