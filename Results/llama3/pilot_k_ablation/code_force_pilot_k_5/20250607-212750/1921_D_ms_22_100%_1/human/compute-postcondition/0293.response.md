Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is either equal to its current value plus one or one less than its current value, a2 is either decreased by 1 or at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif2, a1 is one more than its current value, and b2 is one less than its current value.***
