Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than or equal to a1. If dif3 is greater than dif4, then if dif3 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, a2 is an integer where a2 >= a1 - 1, b2 is an integer where b2 >= b1 - 1, and ans is an integer equal to its original value plus dif4. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, a1 is increased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1.**
