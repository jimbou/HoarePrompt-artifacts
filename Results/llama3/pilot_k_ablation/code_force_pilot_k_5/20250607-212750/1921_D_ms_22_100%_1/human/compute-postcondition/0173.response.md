The only variable in the loop head is variable a1 and a2, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable a1 and a2.  If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is less than or equal to a2, So for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than a2.
State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]**
