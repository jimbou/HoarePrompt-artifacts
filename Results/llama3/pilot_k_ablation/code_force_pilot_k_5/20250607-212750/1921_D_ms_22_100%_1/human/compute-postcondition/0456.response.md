Output State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is as follows: The value of t remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of n and m also remain the same as they are not modified by the code. The lists a and b remain sorted and their elements are within the specified ranges. The indices a1, a2, b1, and b2 are still valid, but a2 and b2 are decremented by 1. The differences dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are still valid, but dif4 is added to ans.
