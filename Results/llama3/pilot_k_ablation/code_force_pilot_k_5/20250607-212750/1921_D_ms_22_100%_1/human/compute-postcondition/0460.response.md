Output State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1.**

The code executes three lines. The first line adds the value of dif3 to ans. The second line decrements a2 by 1. The third line increments b1 by 1. The values of t, n, m, a, b, a1, dif1, dif2, and dif4 remain unchanged.
