Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 1, a2 is n - 1, ans is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, and the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, b2 is m - 2**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to the absolute difference between the first element of `a` and the last element of `b`, which is `dif2`. The value of `a1` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `b2` has been decremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
