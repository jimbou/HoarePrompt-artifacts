Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2], ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of t, n, m, a, b, stdin, a1, dif1, dif2, and dif4 remain unchanged. The value of ans is increased by dif3, which is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1]. The value of a2 is decreased by 1, and the value of b1 is increased by 1.
