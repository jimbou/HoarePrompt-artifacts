Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1, dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2].**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a2`, `dif1`, and `dif3` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is increased by `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a1]` and `b[b2]`. The value of `a1` is incremented by 1, and the value of `b2` is decremented by 1. The values of `dif2` and `dif4` are updated based on the new values of `a1` and `b2`.
