The only variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is either equal to its current value plus one or one less than its current value, a2 is either decreased by 1 or at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than or equal to a2.
State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the last element of b, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three, a1 is either equal to its current value plus one or one less than its current value, a2 is either decreased by 1 or at least 2 more than its original value minus one or one more than its original value, a1 must be less than or equal to a2**
