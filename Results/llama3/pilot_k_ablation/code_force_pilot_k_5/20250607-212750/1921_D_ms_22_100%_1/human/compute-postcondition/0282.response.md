Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the last element of b, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been increased by the value of `dif4`, which is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of `a` and the last element of `b`. The value of `a2` has been decreased by 1, and the value of `b2` has also been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
