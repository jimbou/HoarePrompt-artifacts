Output State: **The program is being run as the main module, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three lines. The first line contains two integers n and m (1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_i (1 <= a_i <= 10^9). The third line contains m integers b_i (1 <= b_i <= 10^9). `t` is an integer larger than 0.**

In natural language, the program is still being run as the main module, and the standard input contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been read and processed. The variable `t` now holds the number of test cases, which is a positive integer. The remaining test cases in the standard input still have three lines each, with the first line containing two integers `n` and `m`, the second line containing `n` integers, and the third line containing `m` integers.
