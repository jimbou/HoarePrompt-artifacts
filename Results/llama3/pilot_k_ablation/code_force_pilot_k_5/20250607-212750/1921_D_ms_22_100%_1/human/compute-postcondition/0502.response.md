The only variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is less than a2, so for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than a2.
State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2, a1 must be less than a2 initially, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1. a1 must be less than a2.**
