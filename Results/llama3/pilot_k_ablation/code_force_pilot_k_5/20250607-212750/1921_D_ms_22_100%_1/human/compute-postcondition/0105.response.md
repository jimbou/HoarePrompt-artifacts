The code prints the sum of the absolute differences between each element of the list `a` and the closest element of the list `b`. Where `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers and `b` is a sorted list of `m` integers.
Output: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is n, a2 is n - 1, ans is the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b, b1 is m, and b2 is m - 1, and the sum of the absolute differences between each element of a and the closest element of b which is ans is being printed**
