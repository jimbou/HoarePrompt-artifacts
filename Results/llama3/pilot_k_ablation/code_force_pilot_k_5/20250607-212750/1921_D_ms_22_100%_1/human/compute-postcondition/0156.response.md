The variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2. If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is less than or equal to a2, but a2 is decreased by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time a2 needs to be greater than a1 after being decreased by 1, meaning a2 must be greater than a1 + 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, and a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif2, and a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. a2 must be greater than a1 + 1**
