Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two, a1 is less than a2. If dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1.***
