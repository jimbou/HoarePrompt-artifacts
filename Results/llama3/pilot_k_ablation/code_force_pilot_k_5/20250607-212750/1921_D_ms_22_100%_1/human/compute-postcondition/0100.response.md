Postcondition: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, if dif4 > dif2, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, a1 is one more than its original value, b2 is one less than its original value, and ans is the sum of its original value and dif2.**
