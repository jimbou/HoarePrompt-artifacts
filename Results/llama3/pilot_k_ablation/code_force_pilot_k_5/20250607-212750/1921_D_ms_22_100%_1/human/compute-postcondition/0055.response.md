Output State: **t is an integer larger than 0 but one less than its original value, n and m are integers where 1 <= n <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, a1 is incremented by 1, b1 is incremented by 1, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1] before the increment, dif1, dif2, dif3, and dif4 are no longer valid as a1 and b1 have changed**
