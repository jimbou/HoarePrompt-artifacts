Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is 0, a2 is n - 1, b1 is 0, b2 is m - 1, ans is 0, and stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
while a1 <= a2:
    dif1 = abs(a[a1] - b[b1])
    dif2 = abs(a[a1] - b[b2])
    dif3 = abs(a[a2] - b[b1])
    dif4 = abs(a[a2] - b[b2])
    if dif1 > dif2:
        if dif3 > dif4:
            if dif3 > dif1:
                ans += dif3
                a2 -= 1
                b1 += 1
            else:
                ans += dif1
                a1 += 1
                b1 += 1
        elif dif4 > dif1:
            ans += dif4
            a2 -= 1
            b2 -= 1
        else:
            ans += dif1
            a1 += 1
            b1 += 1
    elif dif3 > dif4:
        if dif3 > dif2:
            ans += dif3
            a2 -= 1
            b1 += 1
        else:
            ans += dif2
            a1 += 1
            b2 -= 1
    elif dif4 > dif2:
        ans += dif4
        a2 -= 1
        b2 -= 1
    else:
        ans += dif2
        a1 += 1
        b2 -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif2, ans is dif3, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif2, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is dif4, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is dif2, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif1, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1 if dif1 >= dif3. If dif3 is not greater than dif4, then if dif4 is greater than dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif1 is not greater than dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], and either a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1 if dif3 > dif2, or a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1. Otherwise, if dif4 > dif2, then ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, and b2 is decremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif3, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif1 and dif4, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b1 is incremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 is greater than dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif2 and dif3, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b1 is increased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the maximum of dif2 and dif4, and either a1 is incremented by 1 and b2 is decremented by 1, or a2 is decreased by 1 and b2 is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2, a1 must be less than a2 initially, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is increased by the maximum of dif4 and dif1, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is increased by the maximum of dif3 and dif2, a2 is decreased by 1, and b1 is increased by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], a1 is incremented by 1, b2 is decremented by 1.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
