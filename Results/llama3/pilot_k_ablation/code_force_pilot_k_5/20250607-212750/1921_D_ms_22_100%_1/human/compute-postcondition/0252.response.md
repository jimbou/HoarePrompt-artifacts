Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the first element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the last element of a and the last element of b, ans is the sum of its original value and dif3, a2 is one less than its original value, b1 is one more than its original value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

In this final state, the value of `ans` has been updated by adding `dif3` to its original value. The value of `a2` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `b1` has been incremented by 1. All other variables, including `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif2`, `dif4`, and the contents of `stdin`, remain unchanged.
