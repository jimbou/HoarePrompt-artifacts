Output State: **t is an integer larger than 1 but two less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, dif1 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the first element of b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the (a2-1)th element of a and the last element of b, ans is increased by the absolute difference between the (a1)th element of a and the last element of b, a1 is one more than its current value, b2 is one less than its current value, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three.**

The code block increments `ans` by the value of `dif2`, which is the absolute difference between the `(a1)`th element of `a` and the last element of `b`. Then, it increments `a1` by 1 and decrements `b2` by 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `dif1`, `dif3`, and `dif4` remain unchanged. The value of `a1` is increased by 1, and the value of `b2` is decreased by 1. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, minus three.
