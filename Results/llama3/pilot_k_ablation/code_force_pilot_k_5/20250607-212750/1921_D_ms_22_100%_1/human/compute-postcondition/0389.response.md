Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b2]. If dif3 > dif4, then if dif3 > dif1, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1. If dif3 <= dif4, then if dif4 > dif1, ans is increased by dif4, a2 is decreased by 1, and b2 is decreased by 1. Otherwise, ans is increased by dif1, a1 is incremented by 1, and b1 is incremented by 1.***
