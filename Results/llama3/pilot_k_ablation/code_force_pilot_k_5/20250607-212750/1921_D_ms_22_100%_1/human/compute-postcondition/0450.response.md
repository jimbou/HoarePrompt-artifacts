Postcondition: ***t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9. If dif1 > dif2, then if dif3 > dif4, ans is the maximum of dif3 and dif1, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif4, then ans is the maximum of dif4 and dif1, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif1 <= dif2, then if dif3 > dif2, ans is dif3, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. If dif3 <= dif2, then if dif4 > dif2, ans is dif4, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly. Otherwise, ans is dif2, and a1, a2, b1, b2 are updated accordingly.***
