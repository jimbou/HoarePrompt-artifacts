Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a2 is greater than or equal to a1, dif1 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif2 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a1 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, dif3 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b1 in list b, dif4 is the absolute difference between the integer at index a2 in list a and the integer at index b2 in list b, ans is increased by dif3, a2 is decreased by 1, b1 is increased by 1.**
