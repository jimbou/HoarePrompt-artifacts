The only variables in the loop head are a1 and a2, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables a1 and a2.  If a1 is less than or equal to a2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, a1 is less than a2, So for the loop to be executed one more time a1 must be less than a2.
State: **t is an integer larger than 2 but three less than its original value and the original value of t must be at least 4, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than a2.**
