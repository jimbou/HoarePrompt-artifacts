Output State: **t is an integer larger than 3 but three less than its original value, n is an integer where n >= 1, m is an integer where 1 <= m <= 2 * 10^5, a is a sorted list of n integers where 1 <= a_i <= 10^9, b is a sorted list of m integers where 1 <= b_i <= 10^9, a1 is less than or equal to a2, dif1 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b1], dif2 is the absolute difference between a[a1] and b[b2], dif3 is the absolute difference between a[a2-1] and b[b1], dif4 is the absolute difference between a[a2-1] and b[b2], ans is increased by the absolute difference between a[a2] and b[b1].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `ans`, `a2`, and `b1`. The first line increments `ans` by the value of `dif3`, which is the absolute difference between `a[a2]` and `b[b1]`. The second line decrements `a2` by 1, effectively shifting the index `a2` one position to the left in the sorted list `a`. The third line increments `b1` by 1, effectively shifting the index `b1` one position to the right in the sorted list `b`. 

As a result, the values of `dif3` and `dif4` are updated to reflect the new indices `a2-1` and `b1+1`. The value of `ans` is increased by the original value of `dif3`. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `a1`, `dif1`, and `dif2` remain unchanged.
