Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, y is 0, rev_res is an empty string, list_len and max_power are strings representing the first two space-separated inputs, operational_list is a sorted list of strings from the second input line, sorted by the difference in length between each string and its counterpart with trailing zeros removed.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that is a suffix of the string at index 0 of `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 1, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 1. `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index 1 in `operational_list`. If `x` is even, all trailing zeros are removed from the string at index 1 in `operational_list` before the concatenation.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 2, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index 2 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value, the string at index 1 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed, and the string at index 2 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 3, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 3. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index 3 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index 3 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 4, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 4. `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index 4 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
