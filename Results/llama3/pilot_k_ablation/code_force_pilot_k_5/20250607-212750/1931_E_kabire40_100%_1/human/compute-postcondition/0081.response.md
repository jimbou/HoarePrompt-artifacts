Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 4, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is at least 4, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of `operational_list[x]`, with trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the value of `operational_list[x]` to its previous value, and then removing any trailing zeros. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Note that `x` is still at least 4, and `operational_list` is still a sorted list of strings.
