The only variable in the loop head is variable `x` and `list_len`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `list_len`. If `x` is less than `list_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is 7, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 6. For the loop to execute again `x` is increased by 1 so `x` is 8 and for the loop to execute again `list_len` must be greater than 8.
State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 8, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 8**
