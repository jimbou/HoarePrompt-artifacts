Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 1, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is at least 2, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by concatenating its previous value with the value of operational_list[x] and removing any trailing zeros. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains at least two unconsumed test cases.
