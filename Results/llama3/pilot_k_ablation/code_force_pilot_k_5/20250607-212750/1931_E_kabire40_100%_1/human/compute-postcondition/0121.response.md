Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is equal to the integer value of `list_len`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed if the index of the element is even. The current value of `rev_res` has a length of at least `int(max_power) + 1`***
