Postcondition: ***stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least three test cases consumed, y is 1, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 2, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings. If x is even, x is 3 and rev_res is a string that is the first string in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if x is divisible by 2, otherwise the string at index x in operational_list. If x is not divisible by 2, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if x is divisible by 2, otherwise the string at index x in operational_list and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed.***
