Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least three test cases consumed, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is not divisible by 2, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The standard input still contains a sequence of test cases, but at least three test cases have been consumed. The variable `y` remains 1. The string `list_len` still represents an integer greater than 0, and `max_power` still represents the second space-separated input. The list `operational_list` is still sorted. The value of `x` is still not divisible by 2. The string `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string at index `x` in `operational_list` to its previous value.
