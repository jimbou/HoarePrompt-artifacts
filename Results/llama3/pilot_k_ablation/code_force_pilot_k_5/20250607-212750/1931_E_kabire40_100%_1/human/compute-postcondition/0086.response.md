Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 5, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is at least 5, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed if `x` is odd, otherwise without any changes.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code appends the value of `operational_list[x]` to `rev_res`. If `x` is odd, trailing zeros are removed from the concatenated string. The values of other variables remain unchanged.
