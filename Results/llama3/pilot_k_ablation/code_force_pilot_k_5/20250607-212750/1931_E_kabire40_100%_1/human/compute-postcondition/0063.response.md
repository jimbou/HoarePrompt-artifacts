Postcondition: ***stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least four test cases consumed, y is 1, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the strings in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if the index is even, otherwise the string at the index in operational_list. If the length of rev_res is at least int(max_power) + 1, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.***
