Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 5, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 6, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the last character of `operational_list[6]` if it is not '0', otherwise it is the concatenation of its previous value and the last non-'0' character of `operational_list[6]`**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `rev_res`, which is updated by appending the last character of `operational_list[6]` to its previous value, unless the last character is '0', in which case it appends the last non-'0' character of `operational_list[6]`.
