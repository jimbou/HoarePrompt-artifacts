Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 2, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is at least 3, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of operational_list[x].**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by concatenating its previous value with the string at index x in operational_list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed.
