Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is equal to the integer value of `list_len`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed if the index of the element is even.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input state remains unchanged except for the loop variables. The variable `x` is now equal to the integer value of `list_len`, and `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed if the index of the element is even.
