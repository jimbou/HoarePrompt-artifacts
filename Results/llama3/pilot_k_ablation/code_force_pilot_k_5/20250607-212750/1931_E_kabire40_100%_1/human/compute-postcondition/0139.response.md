Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 4, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 5. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list`.***
