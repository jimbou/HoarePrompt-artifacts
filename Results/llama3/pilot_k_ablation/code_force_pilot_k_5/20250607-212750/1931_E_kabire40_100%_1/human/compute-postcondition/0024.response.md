Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is equal to the integer value of `list_len`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed from the strings at even indices.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input stream has been consumed, the value of `y` remains unchanged, the length of the list and the maximum power are still represented as strings, and the operational list remains sorted. The loop counter `x` has reached the length of the list, and the result string `rev_res` is the concatenation of all strings in the operational list, with trailing zeros removed from the strings at even indices.
