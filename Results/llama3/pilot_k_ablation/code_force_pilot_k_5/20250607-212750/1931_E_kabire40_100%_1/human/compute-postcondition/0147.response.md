Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 6, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 7. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the last character of `operational_list[6]` if it is not '0', otherwise it is the concatenation of its previous value and the last non-'0' character of `operational_list[6]`. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is increased by the 7th element of `operational_list`.***
