Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 2, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index 2 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by concatenating its previous value with the string at index 2 in `operational_list` (since `x` is 2) and removing all trailing zeros from the resulting string. The other variables remain unchanged.
