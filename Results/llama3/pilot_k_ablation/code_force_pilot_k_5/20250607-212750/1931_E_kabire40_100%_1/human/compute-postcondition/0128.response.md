The only variable in the loop head is variable  y, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 3, `int(input())` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `int(input())` must be greater than 4.
State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is equal to the integer value of `list_len`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed if the index of the element is even. If the length of `rev_res` is at least `int(max_power) + 1`, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.**
