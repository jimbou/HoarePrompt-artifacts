Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 4, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is at least 4, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value, `operational_list[x]`, and the value of `operational_list[x]`, with trailing zeros removed if `x` is odd, otherwise without any changes.**

In natural language, the output state is: The stdin still contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed. The values of `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still at least 4. The value of `rev_res` is updated by concatenating its previous value with the value of `operational_list[x]`. If `x` is odd, trailing zeros are removed from the concatenated string; otherwise, the concatenated string remains unchanged.
