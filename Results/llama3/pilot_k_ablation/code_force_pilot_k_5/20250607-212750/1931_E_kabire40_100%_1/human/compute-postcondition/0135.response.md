Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings. If `x` is an even integer of at least 1, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of the string in `operational_list` at index `x` with all trailing zeros removed and the original value of `rev_res`. If `x` is an odd integer of at least 1, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list`.***
