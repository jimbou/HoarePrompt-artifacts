Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for x in range(int(list_len)):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
    else:
        rev_res += operational_list[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is at least 1. If x is even, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the string at index x in operational_list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 1, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is at least 2. If x is even, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the string at index x in operational_list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 2, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is at least 3. rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of operational_list[x], with trailing zeros removed if x is odd, otherwise without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 4, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is at least 4. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of `operational_list[x]`, with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value, `operational_list[x]`, and the value of `operational_list[x]`, with trailing zeros removed if `x` is odd, otherwise without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 2, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 5, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is at least 5. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of `operational_list[x]`, with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value, `operational_list[x]`, and the value of `operational_list[x]`, with trailing zeros removed if `x` is odd, otherwise without any changes, and `rev_res` is appended with `operational_list[x]` with trailing zeros removed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
