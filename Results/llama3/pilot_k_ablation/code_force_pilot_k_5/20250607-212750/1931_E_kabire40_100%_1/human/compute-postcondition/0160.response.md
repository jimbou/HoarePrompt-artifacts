Output State: **stdin contains an empty sequence of test cases, y is equal to the number of test cases, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the strings in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if the index is even, and the original string if the index is odd. If the length of rev_res is at least int(max_power) + 1, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that the loop has finished executing all the test cases in the input. The loop counter `y` has reached the total number of test cases, and the input buffer `stdin` is empty. The variables `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x` still hold their last values from the last iteration of the loop. The variable `rev_res` holds the concatenated string of the last test case, with trailing zeros removed from even-indexed strings. The output of the program is either 'Sasha' or 'Anna', depending on the length of `rev_res` compared to `int(max_power) + 1`.
