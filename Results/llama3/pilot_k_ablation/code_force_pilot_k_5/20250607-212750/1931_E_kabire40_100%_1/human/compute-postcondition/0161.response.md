Functionality: **This function processes a sequence of test cases from standard input. Each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers (n and m), and the second line contains n integers. The function sorts the integers based on their length and trailing zeros, then concatenates them in a specific order (removing trailing zeros from even-indexed integers). If the length of the concatenated string is greater than or equal to m + 1, it prints 'Sasha'; otherwise, it prints 'Anna'. The function repeats this process for each test case in the input sequence.**
