Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than `i + 1`, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `rev_res` is a string that is either the first element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed (if `x` is even) or the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list` (if `x` is odd) and then the string at index `x` in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed, `x` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string at index `x` in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
