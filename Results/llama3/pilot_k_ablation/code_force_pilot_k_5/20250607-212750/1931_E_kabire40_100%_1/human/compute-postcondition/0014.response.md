Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 2, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 2, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value, the string at index 1 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed, and the string at index 2 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The standard input still contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed. The variable `y` remains 0. The variable `list_len` still represents an integer greater than 2 as a string. The variable `max_power` still represents the second space-separated input as a string. The `operational_list` remains a sorted list of strings. The variable `x` is still 2. The variable `rev_res` now holds the concatenation of its previous value, the string at index 1 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed, and the string at index 2 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.
