The code `rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')` appends the string value of `operational_list[x]` with all trailing zeros removed to the end of `rev_res`. Since `x` is 0 and `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `operational_list[x]` refers to the first string in the list. The `rstrip('0')` method removes all trailing zeros from this string.

Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least four test cases consumed, `y` is 1, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 0 and is even, `rev_res` is a string that is the first string in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.**
