Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 8, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 8, `rev_res` is increased by the 9th element of `operational_list`**.

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by adding the 9th element of the `operational_list` to it. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed.
