Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, y is 3, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is not divisible by 2, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index x in operational_list.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by concatenating the string at index `x` in `operational_list` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed.
