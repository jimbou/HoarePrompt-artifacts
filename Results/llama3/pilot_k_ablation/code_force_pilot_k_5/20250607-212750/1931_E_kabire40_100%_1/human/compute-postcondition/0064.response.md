To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for y in range(int(input())):`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `y` and the number of test cases in `stdin`. If `y` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1, and `stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least four test cases consumed. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, and `stdin` must still contain at least one unconsumed test case.

State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least three test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the strings in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if the index is even, otherwise the string at the index in operational_list. If the length of rev_res is at least int(max_power) + 1, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.**
