Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least three test cases consumed, y is 1, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 2, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings. If x is even, x is 2 and rev_res is a string that is the first string in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed. If x is not divisible by 2, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by appending the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
