Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than `i + 1`, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `i + 1` in `operational_list`, `x` is `i + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string at index `i + 1` in `operational_list` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
