Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than `x + 1` if `x` is even, otherwise greater than `i + 3`, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is `i + 2`. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is the first element of `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed if `x` is the same as `i + 2`, otherwise it is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `i + 2` in `operational_list`.***
