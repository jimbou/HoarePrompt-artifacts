Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains a sequence of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and m. The second line contains n integers. n is a positive integer, m is a non-negative integer.
Code of the loop:
for y in range(int(input())):
    rev_res = ''
    list_len, max_power = input().split()
    operational_list = sorted(input().split(), key=lambda x: len(x.rstrip(
        '0')) - len(x))
    for x in range(int(list_len)):
        if x % 2 == 0:
            rev_res += operational_list[x].rstrip('0')
        else:
            rev_res += operational_list[x]
    if len(rev_res) >= int(max_power) + 1:
        print('Sasha')
    else:
        print('Anna')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is equal to the integer value of `list_len`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all strings in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed from the strings at even indices. If the length of `rev_res` is at least `int(max_power) + 1`, then 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least four test cases consumed, y is 1, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the strings in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if the index is even, otherwise the string at the index in operational_list. If the length of rev_res is at least int(max_power) + 1, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the values of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed if x is even, otherwise without any changes, for all x in the range of list_len. If the length of rev_res is at least int(max_power) + 1, then 'Sasha' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is equal to the integer value of `list_len`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of all elements in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed if the index of the element is even. If the length of `rev_res` is at least `int(max_power) + 1`, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, y is 4, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the strings in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if the index is even, and the original string if the index is odd. If the length of rev_res is at least int(max_power) + 1, 'Sasha' is printed. Otherwise, 'Anna' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
