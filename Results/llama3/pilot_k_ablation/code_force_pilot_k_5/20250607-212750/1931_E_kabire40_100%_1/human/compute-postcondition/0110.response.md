Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than `i + 3`, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is `i + 2`, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `i + 2` in `operational_list`.**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by concatenating its previous value with the string at index `i + 2` in `operational_list`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that since `x` is equal to `i + 2`, the index used to access `operational_list` is `i + 2`.
