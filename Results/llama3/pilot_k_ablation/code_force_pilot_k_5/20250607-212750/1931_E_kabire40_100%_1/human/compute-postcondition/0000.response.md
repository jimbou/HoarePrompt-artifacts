According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and the `input()` function. For the loop to execute, `input()` must return a value that can be converted to an integer and that integer must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains a sequence of test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the stdin must contain at least one test case and y is 0.
State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases that must have at least one test case, y is 0**
