Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least three test cases consumed, y is 1, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 1, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings. If x is even, x is 2 and rev_res is a string that is the first string in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if x is divisible by 2, otherwise the string at index x in operational_list. If x is not divisible by 2, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed if x is divisible by 2, otherwise the string at index x in operational_list and the string at index x in operational_list with all trailing zeros removed and the string at index x in operational_list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `rev_res` has been updated by appending the string at index `x` in `operational_list` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of test cases with at least three test cases consumed. The values of `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, and `operational_list` are the same as before.
