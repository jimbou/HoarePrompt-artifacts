Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 3, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than `i + 4`, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is `i + 3`, `rev_res` is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `x` in `operational_list` with trailing zeros removed if `x` is the same as `i + 2`, otherwise it is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index `i + 2` in `operational_list` and then the string at index `x` in `operational_list`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The code concatenates the string at index `x` in `operational_list` to `rev_res`. The values of `stdin`, `y`, `list_len`, `max_power`, `operational_list`, and `x` remain the same. The value of `rev_res` is updated by concatenating the string at index `x` in `operational_list` to its previous value. If `x` is the same as `i + 2`, the string at index `x` is concatenated with trailing zeros removed. Otherwise, the string at index `i + 2` is concatenated with trailing zeros removed, and then the string at index `x` is concatenated.
