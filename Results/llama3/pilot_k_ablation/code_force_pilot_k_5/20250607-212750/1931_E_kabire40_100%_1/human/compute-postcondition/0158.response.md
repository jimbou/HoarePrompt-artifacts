Output: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is equal to the integer value of `list_len`, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of the strings in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed if the index is even, and the original string if the index is odd. The length of `rev_res` is less than `int(max_power) + 1`, and 'Anna' is being printed**
