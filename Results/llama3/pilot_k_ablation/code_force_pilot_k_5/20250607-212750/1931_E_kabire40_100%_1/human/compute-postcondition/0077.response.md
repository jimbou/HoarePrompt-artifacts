Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than 2, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is at least 3. If x is even, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the value of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the string at index x in operational_list with trailing zeros removed.**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated based on the value of x. If x is even, rev_res is now the concatenation of its previous value and the value of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed. If x is odd, rev_res is now the concatenation of the original rev_res and the string at index x in operational_list with trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged.
