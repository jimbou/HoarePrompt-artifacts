Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, y is 3, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is an empty string.**

The first line of the code snippet assigns an empty string to the variable `rev_res`, effectively resetting its value. The second line reads two space-separated inputs from stdin and assigns them to the variables `list_len` and `max_power`, respectively. The third line reads a sequence of strings from stdin, sorts them based on the length of the string without trailing zeros, and assigns the sorted list to the variable `operational_list`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code snippet. The value of `y` also remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code snippet. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that at least one test case has been consumed.
