Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the values of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed if x is even, otherwise without any changes, for all x in the range of list_len.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the state of the variables remains the same as before, except for the variable `rev_res`. The value of `rev_res` is now a string that is the concatenation of the values of `operational_list[x]` for all `x` in the range of `list_len`, with trailing zeros removed if `x` is even, and without any changes if `x` is odd.
