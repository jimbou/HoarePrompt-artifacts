Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 6, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 7, `rev_res` is increased by the 7th element of `operational_list`**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by adding the 7th element of `operational_list` to its previous value, since `x` is odd (7). The other variables remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed.
