Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case consumed, `y` is 0, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 2, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is 2. If `x` is even, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value and the string at index 2 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed. If `x` is odd, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of its previous value, the string at index 1 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed, and the string at index 2 in `operational_list` with all trailing zeros removed.***
