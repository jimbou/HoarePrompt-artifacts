Output: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 0, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is equal to the integer value of list_len, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the values of operational_list[x] with trailing zeros removed if x is even, otherwise without any changes, for all x in the range of list_len. The current value of rev_res has a length of at least int(max_power) + 1, and 'Sasha' is being printed**
