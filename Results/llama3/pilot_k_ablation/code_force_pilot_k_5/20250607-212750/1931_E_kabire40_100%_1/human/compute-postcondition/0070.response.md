Output State: **stdin contains a sequence of test cases with at least two test cases unconsumed, y is 2, list_len is a string representing an integer greater than or equal to 1, max_power is a string representing the second space-separated input, operational_list is a sorted list of strings, x is at least 1 and is an odd number, rev_res is a string that is the concatenation of the original rev_res and the string at index x in operational_list**

In this output state, the value of rev_res has been updated by concatenating the string at index x in operational_list to its original value. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the index x is an odd number greater than or equal to 1, so the string concatenated to rev_res is the string at an odd index in operational_list.
