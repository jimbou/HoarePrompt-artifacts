Output State: **`stdin` contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed, `y` is 4, `list_len` is a string representing an integer greater than 0, `max_power` is a string representing the second space-separated input, `operational_list` is a sorted list of strings, `x` is an even integer of at least 1, `rev_res` is a string that is the concatenation of the string in `operational_list` at index `x` with all trailing zeros removed and the original value of `rev_res`**

In this output state, the value of `rev_res` has been updated by concatenating the string in `operational_list` at index `x` with all trailing zeros removed. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a sequence of test cases with at least one test case unconsumed.
