Functionality: **This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers to create two lists, ans1 and ans2, containing duplicate elements from the input, and prints the elements of ans2. The function repeats this process for all test cases.**
