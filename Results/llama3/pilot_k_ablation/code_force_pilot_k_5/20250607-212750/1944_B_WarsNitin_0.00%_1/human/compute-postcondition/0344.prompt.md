Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, i is equal to 0, k is equal to 2 times the value of the second input integer, l is an empty list, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is equal to the value of the first input integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and stdin contains no inputs.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans1`, `ans2` are lists, `i` is 1, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` is reduced by 2. Otherwise, `l` contains the element at index `i - 1` of `b` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 2, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to the third element of `b` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the first element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 3, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to the third element of `b` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the first element of `b` and the second element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 4, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to the fourth element of `b` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the first element of `b`, the second element of `b`, and `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 5, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if the 4th element of `b` is not in `ans1`, `l` has an additional element which is the 4th element of `b`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
