Postcondition: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 4, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is equal to 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to the fourth element of `b` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the first element of `b`, the second element of `b`, and `b[i - 1]`.**
