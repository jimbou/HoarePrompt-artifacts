Output State: **ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and all the elements from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and all the elements from l, i is equal to len(l), k is equal to 0, l is an empty list, q is equal to 0, t is greater than 0, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.**

The loop iterates over the list `l` and appends each element to `ans1` and `ans2`. Since `k` is equal to 0, the loop breaks after the first iteration. Therefore, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `ans1` contains all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, and all the elements from `l`.
* `ans2` contains two copies of each duplicate element from `c` and all the elements from `l`.
* `i` is equal to the length of `l`, since the loop iterates over the entire list.
* `k` remains equal to 0, since it is not modified in the loop.
* `l` is an empty list, since all its elements have been appended to `ans1` and `ans2`.
* `q` is equal to 0, since `len(l)` is 0.
* `t` is greater than 0, since it is not modified in the loop.
* `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged, since they are not affected by the loop.
