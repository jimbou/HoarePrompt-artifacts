Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
