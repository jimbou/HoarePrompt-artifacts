Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 4. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. Additionally, if the (4-1)th element of `b` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list containing the (4-1)th element of `b` which is the third element of `b` since list indices start at 0.***
