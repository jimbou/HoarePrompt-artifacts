To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. 

State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `k` is equal to `req`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the element at index `n - 1` of `b`.**
