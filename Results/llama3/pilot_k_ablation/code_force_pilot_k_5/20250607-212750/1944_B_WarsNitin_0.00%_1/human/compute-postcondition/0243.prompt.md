Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, i is equal to len(l), k is 0 if it was 0 before the code execution, otherwise k is 2 times its original value, q is len(l) + 1, t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, l is an empty list, req is equal to k.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `k` is 2 less than its original value, `q` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` and `ans2` are empty lists, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `k` is 2 times its original value if `k` is not 0, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, and `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`. Additionally, if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `req` is equal to `k` which is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is 0, then `req` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `k` is 2 less than its original value, and all other variables remain unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` and `ans2` are empty lists, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` regardless of whether `b[i - 1]` is in `ans1` or not, `k` is 2 times its original value if `k` is not 0, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, and `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, `k` is reduced by 2, `ans2` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list with an additional element `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, `k` is decreased by 2, and the other variables remain unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, a new list `l` is created that includes the integer at index `i-1` of `b`, otherwise no changes are made to the variables.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 5 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 6, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans2`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a` are unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list with an additional element `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
