Output State: **ans1 is a list, ans2 is a list with two additional elements equal to c[i], i is 5, q is equal to 2, t is greater than 2, n must be greater than 5, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, k is equal to k - 2.**

In this output state, the code has appended two elements equal to c[i] to the list ans2. The value of i remains unchanged at 5. The values of q, t, n, b, c, and a also remain unchanged. The value of k has been decremented by 2.
