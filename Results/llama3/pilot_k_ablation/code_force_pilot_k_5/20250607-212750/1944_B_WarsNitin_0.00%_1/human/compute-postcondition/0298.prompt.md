Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from `c`, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is equal to 0, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and the element at index i of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and the element at index i of l, i is 0, k is equal to 0, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l), t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and the element at index i of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and the element at index i of l, i is 1, k is equal to 0, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 2 elements, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l), t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l, i is 2, k is equal to 0, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 2 elements, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l), t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l and the element at index 3 of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l and the element at index 3 of l, i is 3, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 3 elements, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l), t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l and the element at index 3 of l and the element at index 4 of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l and the element at index 3 of l and the element at index 4 of l, i is 4, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 4 elements, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l), t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
