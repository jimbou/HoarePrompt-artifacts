State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to `req - 2`, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains four copies of the current value of `c[i]`, and `k` is equal to `req - 4`.**
