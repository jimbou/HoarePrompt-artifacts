Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, `i` is 1, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`, and the current value of `k` is 0, which is also equal to twice the original value of k. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`.**
