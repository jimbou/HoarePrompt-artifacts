Postcondition: ***`ans1` contains all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` contains four or six copies of the current value of `c[2]`, `l` contains all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `i` is 3, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains two additional copies of `c[3]` and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2` and `k`.***
