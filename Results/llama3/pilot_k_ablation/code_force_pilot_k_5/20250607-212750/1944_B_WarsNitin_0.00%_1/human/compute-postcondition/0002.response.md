Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, l is an empty list.**

In this output state, the values of `t` and `q` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 1. The variables `n` and `k` are assigned new values based on the input. The list `a` is created from the input, and then split into two lists `b` and `c`, each containing `n` integers. Both `b` and `c` are sorted in ascending order. The lists `ans1`, `ans2`, and `l` are initialized as empty lists. The variable `req` is assigned the value of `2k`, which is an even integer.
