Output State: **ans1 is a list, ans2 is a list containing two copies of the current value of c[i], i is 2, q is equal to 2, t is greater than 2, n must be greater than 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, k is equal to k - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans2` has been modified to include two copies of the current value of `c[i]`, and the value of `k` has been decremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
