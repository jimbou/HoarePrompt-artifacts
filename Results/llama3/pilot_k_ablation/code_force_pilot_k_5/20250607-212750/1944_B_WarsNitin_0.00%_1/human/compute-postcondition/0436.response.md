Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains the element at index 3 of `b`. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
