The code prints the elements of the list `ans1`. Based on the precondition, `ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b` with `len(l)` additional elements from `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `ans1` will only contain pairs of equal elements from `b`.

Output: **pairs of equal elements from the sorted list b**
