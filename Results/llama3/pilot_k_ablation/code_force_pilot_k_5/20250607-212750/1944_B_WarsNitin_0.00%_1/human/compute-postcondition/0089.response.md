Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], `i` is n+2, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, `l` is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element minus three elements, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with all variables retaining their original values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, but this does not affect the values of the variables.
