Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` both have the value of `l[i]` appended to them, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains 0 if it was 0 before the code execution, all other variables retain their original values.**

The provided code snippet consists of two lines, both of which append the value of `l[i]` to `ans1` and `ans2`, respectively. The initial state indicates that `ans1` and `ans2` already have the value of `l[i]` appended to them, so the code snippet does not modify their values further. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but this change is not reflected in the output state as it is not a variable that is being modified by the code. The value of `k` remains 0 if it was 0 before the code execution, but this is not a change caused by the code snippet. All other variables retain their original values, as they are not modified by the code.
