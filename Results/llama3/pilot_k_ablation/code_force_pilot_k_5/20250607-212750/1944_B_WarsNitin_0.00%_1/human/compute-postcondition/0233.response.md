Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `l` is a list that includes the integer at index `i-1` of `b`.**

The code appends the integer at index `i-1` of the sorted list `b` to the list `l`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `l` now includes the integer at index `i-1` of `b`, which is a sorted list of `n` integers.
