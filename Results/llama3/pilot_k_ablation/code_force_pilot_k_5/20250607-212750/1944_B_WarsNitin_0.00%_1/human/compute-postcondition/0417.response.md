Output State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
