Postcondition: ***`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 5 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 6, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, `k` is reduced by 2, and `ans2`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a` are unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list with an additional element `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
