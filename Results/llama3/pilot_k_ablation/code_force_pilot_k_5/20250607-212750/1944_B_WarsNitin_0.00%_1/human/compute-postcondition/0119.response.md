Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include `b[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans1` is still a list, but its contents are not specified. The value of `ans2` is still an empty list. The value of `k` is still an integer equal to its original value minus 2, but only if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, and `k` is still an integer equal to its original value minus 2.
