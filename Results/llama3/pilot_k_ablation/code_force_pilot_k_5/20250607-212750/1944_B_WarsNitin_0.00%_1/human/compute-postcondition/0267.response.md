Postcondition: ***`ans1` contains all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` contains four copies of the current value of `c[2]`, `l` contains all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `i` is 2, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
