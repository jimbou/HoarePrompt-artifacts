Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `i` is 5, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`, `req`, `ans2`, and `k` are updated values, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
