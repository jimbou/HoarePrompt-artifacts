Based on the precondition, `ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, and all the elements from `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `ans1` only contains the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice.

The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of `ans1` as separate values, without any separator or formatting.

Output: **the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice**
