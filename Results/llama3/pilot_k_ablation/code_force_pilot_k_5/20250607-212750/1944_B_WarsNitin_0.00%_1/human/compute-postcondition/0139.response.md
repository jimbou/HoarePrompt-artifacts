Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 5, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 5, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the 6th element of b, k is reduced by 2.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only affects the variables `ans1` and `k`. The list `ans1` now contains two copies of the 6th element of the sorted list `b`, and the value of `k` is reduced by 2.
