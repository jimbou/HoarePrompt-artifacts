Output State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 0, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `l` must have at least 1 element, `k` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
