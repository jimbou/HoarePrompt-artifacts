Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer and must be at least 3, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 3, ans1 is a list containing all the elements of b that appear twice, ans2 is a list containing four copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i], l is a list containing all the elements of b that appear once and are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then l also contains b[n - 1]. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then k is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, otherwise k is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
