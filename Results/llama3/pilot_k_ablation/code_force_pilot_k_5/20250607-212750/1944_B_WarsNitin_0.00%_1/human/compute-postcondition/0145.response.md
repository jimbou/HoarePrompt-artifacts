Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is `n`, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1` and also contains `b[n - 1]`, and `k` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `q` is still 1, there are still multiple test cases minus 2 in the stdin, `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a list of 2n integers, `b` is still a sorted list of n integers, `c` is still a sorted list of n integers, `req` is still an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is still `n`, `ans1` is still a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is still an empty list, `l` is now a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1` and also contains the last element of `b` which is `b[n - 1]`, and `k` is still 0.
