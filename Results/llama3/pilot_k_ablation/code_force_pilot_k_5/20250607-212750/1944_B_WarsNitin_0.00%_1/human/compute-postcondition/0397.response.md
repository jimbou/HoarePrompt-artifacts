Output State: **ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b with an additional element from l, ans2 is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[i] with an additional element from l, i is 4, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, ans1 has one more element than before, ans2 has one more element than before, l has one less element than before.**

In this output state, the values of ans1, ans2, and l have been updated. ans1 and ans2 both have one more element than before, which is the element at index i in list l. List l has one less element than before because one of its elements has been appended to ans1 and ans2. All other variables remain unchanged.
