Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 2 times the number of times `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, `i` is `n`, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each element in `c` that appears at least twice, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, but the program execution breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement.
