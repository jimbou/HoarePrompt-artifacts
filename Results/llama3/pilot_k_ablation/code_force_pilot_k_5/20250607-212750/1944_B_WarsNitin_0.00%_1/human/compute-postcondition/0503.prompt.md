Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is the number of test cases, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n.
Code of the loop:
for q in range(t):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    b = a[:n]
    c = a[n:]
    b.sort()
    c.sort()
    ans1 = []
    ans2 = []
    k = 2 * k
    req = k
    l = []
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
            ans1.append(b[i])
            ans1.append(b[i])
            k -= 2
        elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[i - 1])
    if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[n - 1])
    k = req
    for i in range(1, n):
        if k == 0:
            break
        if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
            ans2.append(c[i])
            ans2.append(c[i])
            k -= 2
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if k == 0:
            break
        ans1.append(l[i])
        ans2.append(l[i])
    print(*ans1)
    print(*ans2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice and additional elements from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and additional elements from l, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element minus len(l) elements, and k is 0, and the list ans2 is printed, which contains two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and additional elements from l

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans1 and ans2 both have the values of l[i] appended to them for all i in range(len(l)), i is equal to len(l), k remains 0 if it was 0 before the code execution, all other variables retain their original values, and the values of ans1 which are the values of l[i] appended to ans1 for all i in range(len(l)) are being printed, and the values of ans2 which are the values of l[i] appended to ans2 for all i in range(len(l)) are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and all the elements from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and all the elements from l, i is equal to len(l), k is equal to 0, l is an empty list, q is equal to 0, t is greater than 0, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and all the elements of ans2 are printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b with len(l) additional elements from l, ans2 is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[i] with len(l) additional elements from l, i is 0, l is an empty list, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, k is equal to 0, and the elements of ans2 are printed which is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[0] with 0 additional elements from l

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: ans1 is a list containing the element at index 2 of l, the element at index 1 of l, the element at index 4 of l, the element at index 3 of l, and the element at index 4 of l, ans2 is a list containing the element at index 2 of l, the element at index 1 of l, the element at index 4 of l, the element at index 3 of l, and the element at index 4 of l, i is 4, q is equal to 2, t is greater than 2, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, l must have at least 4 elements, and the elements of ans2 which are the element at index 2 of l, the element at index 1 of l, the element at index 4 of l, the element at index 3 of l, and the element at index 4 of l are being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
