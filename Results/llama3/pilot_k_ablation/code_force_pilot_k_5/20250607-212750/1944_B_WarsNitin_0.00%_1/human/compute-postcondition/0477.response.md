To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element. Since `l` contains the element at index `n - 1` of `b` if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, we need to adjust the state of `l` to have at least one element.

State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 0, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `k` is equal to 0, `l` must have at least 1 element**
