Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, `i` is n, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`, and `k` is equal to twice the original value of k. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`. `i` is 1, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer and must be at least 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing all the elements of b that appear twice, ans2 is a list containing four copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i], l is a list containing all the elements of b that appear once and are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then l also contains b[n - 1]. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then k is an integer equal to its original value minus 2, otherwise k is an integer equal to its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 3, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is a list containing four copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]`, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 4, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is a list containing four copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` plus two additional copies of `c[i]`, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 4, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues with the current values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `i`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, and `k`

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *The program maintains the conditions that `t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer and must be at least 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 5, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is a list containing four copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` plus two additional copies of `c[i]`, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`, and if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to its original value minus 2. Otherwise, the program maintains the current value of `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
