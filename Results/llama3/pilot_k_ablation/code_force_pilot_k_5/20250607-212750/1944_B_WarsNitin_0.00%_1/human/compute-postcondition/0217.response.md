Postcondition: ***`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is 0, then `req` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `k` is 2 less than its original value, `q` is 1, and `t` is greater than 1. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` and `ans2` are empty lists, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `k` is 2 times its original value if `k` is not 0, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, and `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`.***
