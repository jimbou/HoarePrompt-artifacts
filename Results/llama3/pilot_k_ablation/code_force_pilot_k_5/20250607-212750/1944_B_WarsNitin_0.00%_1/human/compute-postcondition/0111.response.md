Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 1, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`.***
