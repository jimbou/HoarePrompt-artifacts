Output State: **ans1 is a list, ans2 is a list containing two copies of the current value of c[i], i is 1, q is equal to 2, t is greater than 2, n must be greater than 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, k is equal to k - 2.**

In this output state, the value of ans2 has been modified to include two copies of the current value of c[i]. The value of k has also been decremented by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
