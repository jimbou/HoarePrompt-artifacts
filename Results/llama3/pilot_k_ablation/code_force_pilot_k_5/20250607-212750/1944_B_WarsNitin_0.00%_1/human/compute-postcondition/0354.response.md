Output State: **ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is a list with two elements equal to c[i], i is 1, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and k is equal to req - 2.**

The code appends the value of `c[i]` to `ans2` twice, effectively adding two elements equal to `c[i]` to `ans2`. Since `i` is 1, `c[i]` is equal to `c[1]`, which is equal to `c[0]` due to the precondition. Therefore, `ans2` now contains two elements equal to `c[0]`. The value of `k` is decremented by 2, resulting in `k` being equal to `req - 2`. No other variables are affected by the code.
