Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is n, ans1 is a list containing all the elements of b that appear twice, ans2 is an empty list, l is a list containing all the elements of b that appear once and are not in ans1, and k is 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop iterates from 1 to n-1. If the current element of b is equal to the previous element, it is added to ans1 twice and k is reduced by 2. If the current element of b is not equal to the previous element and the previous element is not in ans1, it is added to l. This process continues until k becomes 0 or i reaches n. At the end, ans1 contains all the elements of b that appear twice, l contains all the elements of b that appear once and are not in ans1, and k is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
