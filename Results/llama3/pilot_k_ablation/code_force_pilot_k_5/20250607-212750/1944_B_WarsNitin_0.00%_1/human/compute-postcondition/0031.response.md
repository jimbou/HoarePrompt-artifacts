Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 4, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the 4th element of b.**

In this output state, the value of k has been decremented by 2, and the 4th element of list b has been appended twice to the list ans1. All other variables remain unchanged.
