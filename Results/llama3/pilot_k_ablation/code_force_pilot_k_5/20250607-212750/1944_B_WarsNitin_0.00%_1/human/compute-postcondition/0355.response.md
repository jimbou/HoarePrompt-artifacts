Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req` or `req - 2`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `req - 2`. Otherwise, `ans2` is an empty list and `k` remains equal to `req`.***
