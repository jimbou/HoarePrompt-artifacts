The code prints the values of `ans2` which are the values of `l[i]` appended to `ans2` for all `i` in range(len(l)). Since `ans2` contains the same values as `ans1`, and `ans1` contains the values of `l[i]` appended to it for all `i` in range(len(l)), the print statement will output the values of `l[i]` for all `i` in range(len(l)).

Output: **the values of l[i] for all i in range(len(l))**
