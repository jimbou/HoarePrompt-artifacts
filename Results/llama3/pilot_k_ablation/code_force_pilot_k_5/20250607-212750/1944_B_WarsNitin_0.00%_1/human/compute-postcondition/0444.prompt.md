Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, i is 0, l is an empty list, q is equal to 2, t is greater than 2, n is an integer, k is equal to 2 times the integer value of the first input, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two occurrences of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, `l` contains the element at index `i - 1` of `b` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` has an additional element `b[1]`. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 3, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if the element at index `i-1` of `b` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains the element at index 2 of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains the element at index 3 of `b`. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 5, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if the element at index 4 of `b` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains the element at index 4 of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
