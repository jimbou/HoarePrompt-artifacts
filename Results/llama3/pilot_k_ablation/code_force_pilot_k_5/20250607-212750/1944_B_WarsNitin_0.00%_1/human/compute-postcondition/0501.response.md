The code prints the elements of the list `ans2` which are the element at index 2 of `l`, the element at index 1 of `l`, the element at index 4 of `l`, the element at index 3 of `l`, and the element at index 4 of `l`. Since the exact elements of `l` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of these elements. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output these elements in the specified order.

Output: **the element at index 2 of l, the element at index 1 of l, the element at index 4 of l, the element at index 3 of l, and the element at index 4 of l (where these elements are from the list l)**
