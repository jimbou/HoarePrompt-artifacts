Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`, `k` is 0, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `l` is an empty list, `req` is equal to `k` which is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and we exit the current loop or if statement.
