Based on the precondition, the print statement will print the elements of the list `ans2`. The list `ans2` contains two copies of each element in `c` that appears at least twice and additional elements from `l`. Since `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element minus `len(l)` elements, the additional elements from `l` will be included in `ans2`.

Output: **Two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and additional elements from l**
