Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 5, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `ans1`, `ans2`, `i`, `l`, `q`, `t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
