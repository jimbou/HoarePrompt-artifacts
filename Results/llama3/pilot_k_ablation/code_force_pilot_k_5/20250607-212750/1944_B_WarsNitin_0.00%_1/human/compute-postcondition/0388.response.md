Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b` with an additional element from `l`, `ans2` is a list with an even number of elements equal to `c[i]` with an additional element from `l`, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
