Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list containing the element at index 2 of l, the element at index 1 of l, the element at index 4 of l, and the element at index 3 of l, `ans2` is a list containing the element at index 2 of l, the element at index 1 of l, the element at index 4 of l, and the element at index 3 of l, `i` is 4, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, `a` is a list of len(a) integers, `l` must have at least 4 elements. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
