Output State: **ans1 is a list containing two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, i is at least 1 and at most n-1, n is an integer and at least 2, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, l is an empty list, k is 2 less than its original value, q is 1, t is greater than 1.**

In this output state, the code has appended two copies of the current value of `b[i]` to the list `ans1`. The value of `k` has been decremented by 2. The values of `ans2`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `c`, `a`, `l`, `q`, and `t` remain unchanged. Note that since `k` was originally 2 times its original value, it is now 2 less than that, which means it is now equal to its original value.
