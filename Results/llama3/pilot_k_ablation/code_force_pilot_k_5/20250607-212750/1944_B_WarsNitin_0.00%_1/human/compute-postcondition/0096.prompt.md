Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1. If the last element of b is not in ans1, it is now in l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice, and k is 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element minus one element.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n+1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element minus two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n+1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element minus two elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n+1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice, an additional element from l, and an additional element from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice, an additional element from l, and an additional element from l, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element minus four elements.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n+1, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice, an additional element from l, and an additional element from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice, an additional element from l, an additional element from l, and an additional element from l, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 2 elements minus five elements. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
