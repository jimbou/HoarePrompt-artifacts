The `print(*ans1)` statement will print the elements of the list `ans1`.

Since `ans1` has the values of `l[i]` appended to it for all `i` in range(len(l)), it contains all the elements of the list `l`.

Therefore, the print statement will output all the elements of the list `l`.

Output: **all elements of the list l**
