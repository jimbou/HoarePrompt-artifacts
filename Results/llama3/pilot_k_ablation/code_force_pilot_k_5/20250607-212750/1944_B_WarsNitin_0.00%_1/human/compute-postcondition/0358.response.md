Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req` or `req - 2`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
