Output State: **ans1 has two additional elements equal to b[i], k is decreased by 2, ans2 is unchanged, i is unchanged, n is unchanged, b is unchanged, c is unchanged, a is unchanged**

In this output state, ans1 has two additional elements equal to b[i], which means that the value of b[i] is appended to ans1 twice. The value of k is decreased by 2, which means that k is now k - 2. The other variables, ans2, i, n, b, c, and a, remain unchanged.
