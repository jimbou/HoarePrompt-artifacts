Postcondition: **`ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `l` is an empty list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. The current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.**
