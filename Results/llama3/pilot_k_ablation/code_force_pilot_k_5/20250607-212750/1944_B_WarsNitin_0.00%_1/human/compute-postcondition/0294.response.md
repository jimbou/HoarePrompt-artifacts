To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(l)):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of list `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `l` must have at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 4 elements, because `i` is now 4 and the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `l`.

The other variables in the state, such as `ans1`, `ans2`, `q`, `t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a`, are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, and the element at index `i` of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l` and the element at index 3 of `l`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from `c` and the element at index `i` of `l` and the element at index `i` of `l` and the element at index 3 of `l`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least 4 elements, `q` is equal to `len(l)` + 1 if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l)` + 1, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a)` - `n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.**
