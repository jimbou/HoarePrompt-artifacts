To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` has increased, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 2, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.**
