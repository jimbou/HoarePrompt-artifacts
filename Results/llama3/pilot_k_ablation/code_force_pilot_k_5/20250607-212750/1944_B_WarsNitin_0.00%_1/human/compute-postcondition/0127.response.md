Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 3. If b[i - 1] is not in ans1, then l is a list containing the (i-1)th element of b, which is the 2nd element of b since i is 3. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
