Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer and must be at least 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 2, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`, `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `k` is an integer equal to its original value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code only contains a break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or if statement it is currently in. The values of all variables remain the same, but the program will no longer execute the code inside the loop or if statement it was in.
