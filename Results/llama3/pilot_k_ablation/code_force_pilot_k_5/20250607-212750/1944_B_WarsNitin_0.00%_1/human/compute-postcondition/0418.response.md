Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
