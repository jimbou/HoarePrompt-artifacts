Postcondition: **The program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement when `k` is 0, or continues execution with the updated values of `req`, `ans2`, and `k` when `k` is not 0, maintaining the conditions that `t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `i` is 4, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, and `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`.**
