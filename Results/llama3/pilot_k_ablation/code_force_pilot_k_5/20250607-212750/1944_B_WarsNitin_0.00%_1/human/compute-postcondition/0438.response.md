Output State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 5, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program execution is interrupted, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
