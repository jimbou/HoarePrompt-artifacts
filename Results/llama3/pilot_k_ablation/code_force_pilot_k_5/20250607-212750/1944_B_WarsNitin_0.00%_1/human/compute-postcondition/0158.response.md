Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer and must be at least 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing all the elements of b that appear twice, ans2 is a list containing four copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i], l is a list containing all the elements of b that appear once and are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then l also contains b[n - 1], k is an integer equal to its original value minus 2.**

The code block modifies the state of the variables as follows: The first line appends the value of `c[i]` to `ans2`. Since `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, `ans2` now contains four copies of `c[i]`. The second line appends the value of `c[i]` to `ans2` again. The third line decrements `k` by 2. No other variables are affected.
