Postcondition: ***`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is 2, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
