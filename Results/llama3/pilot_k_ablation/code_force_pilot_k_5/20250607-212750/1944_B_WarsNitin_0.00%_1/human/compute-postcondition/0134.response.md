Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 4. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[3]` and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list containing the `(i-1)`th element of `b`, which is the 3rd element of `b` since `i` is 4. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now contains an additional element equal to the `(i-1)`th element of `b` which is the 3rd element of `b` since `i` is 4.***
