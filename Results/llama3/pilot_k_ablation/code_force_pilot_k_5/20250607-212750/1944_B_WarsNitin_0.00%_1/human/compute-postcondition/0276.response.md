Output State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from `c`, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is equal to 0, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.**

The loop will continue to execute until `i` is equal to `n` or `k` is equal to 0. In each iteration, if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, two copies of `c[i]` will be appended to `ans2` and `k` will be decreased by 2. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, no changes will be made to `ans2` and `k`. The loop will terminate when `i` is equal to `n` or `k` is equal to 0. At this point, `ans1` will still contain all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `l` will still contain all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` will still be greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` will still be an integer, `b` will still be a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` will still be a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, and `a` will still be a list of `len(a)` integers.
