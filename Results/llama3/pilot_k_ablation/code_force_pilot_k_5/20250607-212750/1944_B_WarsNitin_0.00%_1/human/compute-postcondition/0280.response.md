Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from `c`, `i` is 0, `k` is equal to 0, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element, `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
