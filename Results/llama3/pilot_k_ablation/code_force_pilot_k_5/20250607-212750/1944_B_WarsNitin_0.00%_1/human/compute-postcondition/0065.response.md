Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, otherwise `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 4, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
