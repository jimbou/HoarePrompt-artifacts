Postcondition: ***`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, `k` is decreased by 2, and the other variables remain unchanged. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, a new list `l` is created that includes the integer at index `i-1` of `b`, otherwise no changes are made to the variables.***
