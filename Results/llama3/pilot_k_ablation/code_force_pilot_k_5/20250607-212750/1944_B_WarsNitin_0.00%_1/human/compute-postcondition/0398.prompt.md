Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list with an even number of elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req` or `req - 2 * x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(l)):
    if k == 0:
        break
    ans1.append(l[i])
    ans2.append(l[i])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b with an additional element from l, ans2 is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[i] with an additional element from l, i is 0, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element with the first element removed, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, k is not equal to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b with an additional element from l, ans2 is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[i] with an additional element from l, i is 1, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b with an additional element from l, ans2 is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[i] with an additional element from l, i is 2, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, ans1 has an additional element from l, ans2 has an additional element from l.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b with an additional element from l, ans2 is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[i] with an additional element from l, i is 3, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 2 elements, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b with an additional element from l, ans2 is a list with an even number of elements equal to c[i] with an additional element from l, i is 4, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than or equal to 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, ans1 has one more element than before, ans2 has one more element than before, l has one less element than before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
