Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, l is an empty list, i is 1. The current value of b[i - 1] is not in ans1. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1].***
