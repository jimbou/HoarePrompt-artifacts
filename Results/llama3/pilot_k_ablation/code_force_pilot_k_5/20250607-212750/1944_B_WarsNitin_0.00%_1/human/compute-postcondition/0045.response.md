Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, k is 0, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is n, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1. If the last element of b is not in ans1, it is now in l.***
