Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `l` is a list with an additional element `b[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged, the value of `i` is still between 3 and `n-1` (inclusive), `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, the lists `b` and `c` are still sorted and have the same lengths, and the list `a` has the same length. The list `l` now has an additional element, which is the `(i-1)`th element of the list `b`.
