The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `i` is 5, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, and `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`, `req`, `ans2`, and `k` are updated values**
