Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 3, `ans1` contains two additional elements equal to `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `l` is a list containing the value of `b[1]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `q`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remain unchanged. The value of `k` is still an even integer equal to twice its original value, but its actual value is not specified. The value of `i` is still 3. The value of `ans1` is updated to include two additional elements equal to `b[i]` if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`. The value of `l` is updated to contain the value of `b[1]` if `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
