Output State: **ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, ans2 is a list containing two copies of the current value of c[i], i is 1, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1, t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer greater than 1, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, k is equal to req - 2, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l).**

In this output state, the code has appended two copies of the current value of c[i] to ans2, and decremented k by 2. The values of ans1, l, t, n, b, c, and a remain unchanged. The value of k is updated to req - 2, and the value of q remains dependent on whether the last element of b is in ans1.
