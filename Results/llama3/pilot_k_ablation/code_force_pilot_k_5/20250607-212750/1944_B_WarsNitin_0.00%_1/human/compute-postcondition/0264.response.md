Postcondition: ***The program continues with the current values of ans1, ans2, i, l, t, n, b, c, a, and q. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then ans2 contains four copies of the current value of c[i], and k is decreased by 2. Otherwise, the values of ans1, ans2, i, l, t, n, b, c, a, and q remain unchanged. In either case, ans1 contains all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, l contains all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1, t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer greater than 3, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l).***
