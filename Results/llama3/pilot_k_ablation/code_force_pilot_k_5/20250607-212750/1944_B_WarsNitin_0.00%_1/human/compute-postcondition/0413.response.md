Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `l` is a list containing the element at index `i - 1` of `b`, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. The element at index `i` of `b` is not equal to the element at index `i - 1` of `b`. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is in `l` but not in `ans1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `l` now contains the element at index `i - 1` of `b`, which is not equal to the element at index `i` of `b` and is not in `ans1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
