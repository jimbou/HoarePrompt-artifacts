The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 5, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers**
