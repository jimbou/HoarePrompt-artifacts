Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 times the number of times c[i] is equal to c[i-1], i is n+2, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice and an additional element from l, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element minus three elements. If k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
