Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 2 if c[i] is equal to c[i-1], otherwise req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 2, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1, ans2 is a list containing two copies of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i-1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of the current value of c[i], k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4 if c[i] is equal to c[i-1], otherwise k is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k.***
