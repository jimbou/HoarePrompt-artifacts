Output State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `k` is equal to `req` and is currently equal to 0. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the element at index `n - 1` of `b`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
