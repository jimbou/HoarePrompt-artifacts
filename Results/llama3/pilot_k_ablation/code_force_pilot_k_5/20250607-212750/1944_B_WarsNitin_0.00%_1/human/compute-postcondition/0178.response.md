Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer and must be at least the original value of `n`, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k` minus 4 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is equal to the original value of `n`, `ans1` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear twice, `ans2` is a list containing four copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is a list containing two copies of `c[i]` plus two additional copies of `c[i]`, `l` is a list containing all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1` and is not empty, `k` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain the same, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2.
