Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is greater than 5, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, i is 5, ans1 is a list containing two copies of each element in b that appears at least twice, l is a list containing the elements in b that appear only once and are not in ans1, req, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each element in c that appears at least twice, k is k minus 2.**

The code block appends two copies of the element at index `i` in list `c` to list `ans2`, and then decrements the value of `k` by 2. The value of `i` is 5, so the element at index 5 in list `c` is appended to `ans2` twice. The value of `k` is decreased by 2. No other variables are affected by the code block.
