Output State: **ans1 has two additional elements equal to b[i], k is reduced by 2, ans2 is unchanged, i is unchanged, n is unchanged, b is unchanged, c is unchanged, a is unchanged.**

The code snippet modifies the state of `ans1` by appending the value of `b[i]` twice, effectively adding two elements to the list. The value of `k` is decreased by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
