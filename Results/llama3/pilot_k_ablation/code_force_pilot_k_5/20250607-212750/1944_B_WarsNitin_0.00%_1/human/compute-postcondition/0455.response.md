Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 1, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains two copies of the current value of `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, no change is made.***
