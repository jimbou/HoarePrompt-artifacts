Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, `i` is 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the additional note that we have broken out of a loop or if statement.
