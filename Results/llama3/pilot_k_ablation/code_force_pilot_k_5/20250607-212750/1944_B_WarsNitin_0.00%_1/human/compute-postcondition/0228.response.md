Postcondition: ***`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]`, `k` is reduced by 2, `ans2` is unchanged, `i` is unchanged, `n` is unchanged, `b` is unchanged, `c` is unchanged, `a` is unchanged. Otherwise, if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list with an additional element `b[i - 1]`.***
