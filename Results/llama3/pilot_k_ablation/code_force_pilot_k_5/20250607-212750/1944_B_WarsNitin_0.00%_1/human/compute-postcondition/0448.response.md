Output State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `k` is equal to `req`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the element at index `n - 1` of `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `req`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans1` still contains its original elements, `ans2` remains empty, and the values of `i`, `q`, `t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a` are unchanged. Additionally, if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` still contains the element at index `n - 1` of `b`.
