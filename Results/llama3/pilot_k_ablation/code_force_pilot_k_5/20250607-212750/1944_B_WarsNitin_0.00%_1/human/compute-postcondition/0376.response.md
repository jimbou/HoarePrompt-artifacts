Output State: **`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list with an even number of elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req` or `req - 2 * x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

* `ans1` remains a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`.
* `ans2` becomes a list with an even number of elements equal to `c[i]`, where `i` is the last index of the loop.
* `i` is equal to `n`, which means the loop has executed `n-1` times.
* `l` remains a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`.
* `q` and `t` remain unchanged, with `q` equal to 1 and `t` greater than 1.
* `n` is greater than or equal to 1, which means the loop has executed at least once.
* `b` and `c` remain sorted lists of integers.
* `a` remains a list of `len(a)` integers.
* `k` is either equal to `req` or `req - 2 * x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer. This means that `k` has been decremented by 2 in each iteration where `c[i]` is equal to `c[i-1]`.
