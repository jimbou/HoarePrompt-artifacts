Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 5. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the original values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `i`.***
