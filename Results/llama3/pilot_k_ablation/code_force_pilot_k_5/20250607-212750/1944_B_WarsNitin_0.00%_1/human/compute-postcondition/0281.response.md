Output State: **ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and the element at index i of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and the element at index i of l, i is 0, k is equal to 0, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 1 element, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l), t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.**

In this output state, the code has appended the element at index `i` of list `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2`. The value of `i` remains 0, and `k` is still equal to 0. List `l` remains unchanged, containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, with at least one element. The value of `q` depends on whether the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, and `t` is still greater than `len(l) + 1`. The values of `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged.
