The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 5. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 5 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 6, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.**
