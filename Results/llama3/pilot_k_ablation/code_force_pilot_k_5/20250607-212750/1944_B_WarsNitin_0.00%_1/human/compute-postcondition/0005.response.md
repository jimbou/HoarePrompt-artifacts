Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value and is currently 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k and is currently 0, `l` is an empty list, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 1. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
