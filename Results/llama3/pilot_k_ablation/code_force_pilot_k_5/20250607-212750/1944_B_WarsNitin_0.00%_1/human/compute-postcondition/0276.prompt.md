Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is equal to `req`, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to `req - 2`, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to `req - 2`, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains four copies of the current value of `c[i]`, and `k` is equal to `req - 4`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *The program continues with the current values of ans1, ans2, i, l, t, n, b, c, a, and q. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then ans2 contains four copies of the current value of c[i], and k is decreased by 2. Otherwise, the values of ans1, ans2, i, l, t, n, b, c, a, and q remain unchanged. In either case, ans1 contains all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, l contains all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1, t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer greater than 3, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l).

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`ans1` contains all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` contains four or six copies of the current value of `c[2]`, `l` contains all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `i` is 2, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to `k - 2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`ans1` contains all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` contains four or six copies of the current value of `c[2]`, `l` contains all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `i` is 3, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains two additional copies of `c[3]` and `k` is decreased by 2. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans2` and `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
