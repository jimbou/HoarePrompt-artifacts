Output State: **ans1 and ans2 both have the values of l[i] appended to them for all i in range(len(l)), i is equal to len(l), k remains 0 if it was 0 before the code execution, all other variables retain their original values.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the lists `ans1` and `ans2` will contain all the elements of `l`, the variable `i` will be equal to the length of `l`, and the variable `k` will remain 0 if it was 0 before the loop started. All other variables will retain their original values.
