Output State: **ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l and the element at index 3 of l and the element at index 4 of l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and the element at index i of l and the element at index i of l and the element at index 3 of l and the element at index 4 of l, i is 4, l is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1 and must have at least 4 elements, q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l), t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers.**

The code appends the element at index `i` of `l` to both `ans1` and `ans2`. Since `i` is 4, this means that the element at index 4 of `l` is added to both lists. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
