Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 1, `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `q` is still 1, and there are still multiple test cases minus 2 in stdin. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, `i`, `ans1`, and `ans2` remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the value of `b[i - 1]`, which is not present in `ans1`. Also, `b[i]` is still not equal to `b[i - 1]`.
