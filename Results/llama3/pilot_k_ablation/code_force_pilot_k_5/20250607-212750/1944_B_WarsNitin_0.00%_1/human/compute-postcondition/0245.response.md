Output State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is 0, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and the last element of `b`, `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l)`, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the last element of `b`, which is not a duplicate element. The length of `l` has increased by 1, so `q` is now equal to `len(l)`. The other variables remain unchanged.
