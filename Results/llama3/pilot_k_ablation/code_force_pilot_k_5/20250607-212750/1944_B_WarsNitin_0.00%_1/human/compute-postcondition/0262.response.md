Postcondition: **The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if k is equal to 0, otherwise, the program continues with the current values of ans1, ans2, i, l, t, n, b, c, a, and q, where ans1 contains all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, ans2 contains two copies of the current value of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is an empty list, i is 3, l contains all the non-duplicate elements from b that are not in ans1, t is greater than len(l) + 1, n is an integer greater than 3, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and q is equal to len(l) + 1 if the last element of b is in ans1, otherwise q is equal to len(l).**
