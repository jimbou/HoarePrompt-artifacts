Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is n, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, l is an empty list, and k is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 2. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 is a list containing two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, and k is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 is a list, ans2 is an empty list, and l is a list containing b[i - 1] if b[i - 1] is not in ans1. If k is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 3. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then ans1 has two additional elements equal to b[3] and k is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then if b[i - 1] is not in ans1, l is a list containing the (i-1)th element of b, which is the 2nd element of b since i is 3. If k is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 4. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list containing the `(i-1)`th element of `b`, which is the 3rd element of `b` since `i` is 4. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, `l` now contains an additional element equal to the `(i-1)`th element of `b` which is the 3rd element of `b` since `i` is 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 5. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the original values of `t`, `q`, `stdin`, `n`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `i`. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the 6th element of `b`, and `k` is reduced by 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, if the 4th element of `b` is not in `ans1`, a list `l` is created containing the 4th element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
