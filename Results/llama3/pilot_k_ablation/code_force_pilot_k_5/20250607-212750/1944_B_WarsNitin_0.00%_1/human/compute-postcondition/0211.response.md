Postcondition: ***`ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `l` is an empty list. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `req` is equal to `k` which is 0. If `k` is not 0, `k` is 2 times its original value, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`. Additionally, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`.***
