Postcondition: ***`ans1` and `ans2` both have the value of `l[i]` appended to them, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains 0 if it was 0 before the code execution, all other variables retain their original values, `l` must have at least `i+2` elements. If `k` was 0 before the code execution, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
