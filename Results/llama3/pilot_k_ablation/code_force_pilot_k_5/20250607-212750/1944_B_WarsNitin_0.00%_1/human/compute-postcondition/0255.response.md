The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `k` is equal to `req - 2`, and `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`**
