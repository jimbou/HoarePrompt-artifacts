Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `k` is equal to `req`. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the element at index `n - 1` of `b`.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 1, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains two copies of the current value of `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, no change is made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 2, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` contains two copies of the current value of `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, no change is made. If `k` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 3, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 4, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is a list, `i` is 5, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two additional elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
