To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `l`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `l`. If `l` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute.

State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from `c`, `i` is 0, `k` is equal to 0, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element, `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers**
