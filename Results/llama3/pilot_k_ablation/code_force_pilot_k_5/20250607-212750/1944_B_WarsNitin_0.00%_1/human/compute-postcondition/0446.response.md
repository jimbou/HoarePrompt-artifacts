Output State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is a list containing the element at index `n - 1` of `b`, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the element at index `n - 1` of `b`, which is the last element of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.
