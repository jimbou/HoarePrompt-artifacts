Postcondition: **`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two or four elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req`, `req - 2`, or `req - 4`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list with four elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is either equal to `req - 2` or `req - 4`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
