Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 5, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 5, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the 5th element of b.**

The code appends the 5th element of list b to ans1 twice, then decrements k by 2. The value of k is reduced by 2, and ans1 now contains two copies of the 5th element of b. No other variables are affected.
