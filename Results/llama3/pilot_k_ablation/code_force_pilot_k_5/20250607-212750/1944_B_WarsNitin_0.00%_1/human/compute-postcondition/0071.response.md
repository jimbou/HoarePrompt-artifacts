Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is greater than 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `i` is 5, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`, `req`, `ans2`, and `k` are updated values. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
