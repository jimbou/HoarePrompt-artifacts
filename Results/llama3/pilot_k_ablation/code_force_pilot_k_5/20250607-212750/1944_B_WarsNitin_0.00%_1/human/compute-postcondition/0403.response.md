The only variable in the loop head is `q` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `q` and `t`. If `q` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `q` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `q` must be increased by 1, so `q` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
