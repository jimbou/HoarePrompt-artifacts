Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The variables `t`, `q`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `req`, and `i` retain their original values and properties as specified in the initial state. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
