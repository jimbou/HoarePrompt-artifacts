According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is the number of test cases, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0 and `q` is now 0. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n**
