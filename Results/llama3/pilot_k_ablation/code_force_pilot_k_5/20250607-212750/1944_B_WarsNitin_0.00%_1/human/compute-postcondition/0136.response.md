The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 5**
