To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to but not including `n`). 

State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to `req`, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers**
