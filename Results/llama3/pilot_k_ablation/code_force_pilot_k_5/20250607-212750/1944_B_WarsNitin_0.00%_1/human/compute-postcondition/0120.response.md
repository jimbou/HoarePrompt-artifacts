Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the current value of `b[i]`, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`, and `k` is an integer equal to its original value minus 2. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is terminated.**
