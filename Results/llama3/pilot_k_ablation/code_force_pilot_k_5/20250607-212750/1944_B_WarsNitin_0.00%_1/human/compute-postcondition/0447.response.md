Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` contains the element at index `n - 1` of `b`.***
