The code prints all the elements of the list `ans2`. The list `ans2` contains two copies of each duplicate element from the list `c` and all the elements from the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `ans2` only contains two copies of each duplicate element from the list `c`.

Output: **two copies of each duplicate element from the list c**
