Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is `n`, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`, and the last element of `b` is now in `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` is still greater than 0, `q` is still 0, there are still multiple test cases minus 1 in stdin, `n` is still an integer, `k` is still 0, `a` is still a list of 2n integers, `b` is still a sorted list of n integers, `c` is still a sorted list of n integers, `req` is still an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is still `n`, `ans1` is still a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, and `l` is now a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`, including the last element of `b` which is now in `l`.
