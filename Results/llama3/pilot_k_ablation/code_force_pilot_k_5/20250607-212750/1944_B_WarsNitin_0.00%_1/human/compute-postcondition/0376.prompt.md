Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is equal to the value of the first input integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is equal to `req`. If the last element of `b` is not in `ans1`, then the last element of `b` is included in `l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
        ans2.append(c[i])
        ans2.append(c[i])
        k -= 2


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req` or `req - 2`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` has two elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is equal to `req - 2`. Otherwise, `ans2` is an empty list and `k` remains equal to `req`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two or four elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 2, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req`, `req - 2`, or `req - 4`. If `k` is 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two or four elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 3, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 3, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req`, `req - 2`, or `req - 4`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list with four elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is either equal to `req - 2` or `req - 4`. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two or four elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 4, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req`, `req - 2`, `req - 4`, or `req - 6`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list with four elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is either equal to `req - 2`, `req - 4`, or `req - 6`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is either an empty list or a list with two or four elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 5, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is either equal to `req`, `req - 2`, `req - 4`, or `req - 6`. If `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list with four elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is either equal to `req - 2`, `req - 4`, or `req - 8`. If `c[i]` is not equal to `c[i - 1]`, then `ans2` is a list with two elements equal to `c[i]` and `k` is either equal to `req`, `req - 2`, `req - 4`, or `req - 6`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
