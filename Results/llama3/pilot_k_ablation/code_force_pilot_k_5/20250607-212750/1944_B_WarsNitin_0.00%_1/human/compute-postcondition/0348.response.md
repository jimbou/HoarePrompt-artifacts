Output State: **`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is equal to the value of the first input integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is equal to `req`. If the last element of `b` is not in `ans1`, then the last element of `b` is included in `l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `req`. All other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the last element of `b` and the list `l` still apply.
