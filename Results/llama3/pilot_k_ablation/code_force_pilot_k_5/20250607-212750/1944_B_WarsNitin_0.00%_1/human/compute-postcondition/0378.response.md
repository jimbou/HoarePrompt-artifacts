Postcondition: ***`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is a list with an even number of elements equal to `c[i]`, `i` is 0, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1` and must have at least 1 element, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and `k` is equal to 0, which means `k` is either equal to `req` or `req - 2 * x`, where `x` is a non-negative integer***
