Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is a list containing two copies of the current value of b[i], ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, l is an empty list, i is 1. The current value of b[i] is equal to the current value of b[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been reduced by 2, and `ans1` now contains two copies of the current value of `b[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
