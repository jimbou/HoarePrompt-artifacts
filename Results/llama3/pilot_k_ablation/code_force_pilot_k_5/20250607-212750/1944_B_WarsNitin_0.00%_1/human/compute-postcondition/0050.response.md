Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 1, `ans1` is a list containing two copies of each element in `b` that appears at least twice, `l` is a list containing the elements in `b` that appear only once and are not in `ans1`. If the last element of `b` is not in `ans1`, it is now in `l`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
