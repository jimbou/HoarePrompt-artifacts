Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer greater than 4, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 4, ans1 has two additional elements equal to b[i], k is an integer equal to its original value minus 2.**

In this output state, the code has appended two elements equal to `b[i]` to `ans1`, and decreased the value of `k` by 2. All other variables remain unchanged.
