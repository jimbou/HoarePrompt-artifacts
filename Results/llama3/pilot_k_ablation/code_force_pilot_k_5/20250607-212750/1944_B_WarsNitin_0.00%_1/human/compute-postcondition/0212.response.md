Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `l` is a list containing `b[i - 1]`, `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `req` is equal to `k` which is 0. If `k` is not 0, `k` is 2 times its original value, `q` is `len(l) + 1`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The lists `ans1` and `ans2` remain empty. The value of `i` is still between 1 and `n-1`, and `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2. The lists `b`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the element `b[i - 1]`. The condition that `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]` and `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1` still holds. The values of `k`, `q`, and `t` are updated accordingly, and if `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
