Output State: **t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 3, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value minus 2, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 3, ans1 contains two additional elements equal to b[i], l is a list containing the value of b[1].**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been decreased by 2, and `ans1` now contains two additional elements equal to `b[i]`. The value of `l` is still a list containing the value of `b[1]`. All other variables remain unchanged.
