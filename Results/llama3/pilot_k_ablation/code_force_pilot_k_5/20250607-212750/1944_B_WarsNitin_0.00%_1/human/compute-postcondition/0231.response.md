Postcondition: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 5, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.**
