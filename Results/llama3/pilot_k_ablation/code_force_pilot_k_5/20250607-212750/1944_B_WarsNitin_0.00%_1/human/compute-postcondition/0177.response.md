Postcondition: ***t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer and must be at least the original value of n, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is equal to the original value of n, ans1 is a list containing all the elements of b that appear twice, ans2 is a list containing four copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] plus two additional copies of c[i], l is a list containing all the elements of b that appear once and are not in ans1 and is not empty. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then l also contains b[n - 1]. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then k is equal to its original value minus 2. Otherwise, the program maintains the current value of k, i is 0, and the current value of k is 0.***
