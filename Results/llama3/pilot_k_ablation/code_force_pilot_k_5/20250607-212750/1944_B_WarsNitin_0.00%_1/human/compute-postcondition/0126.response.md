Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 3, `l` is a list containing the (i-1)th element of `b`, which is the 2nd element of `b` since i is 3. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 1, `q` is still 1, there are still multiple test cases minus 2 in the stdin, `n` is still an integer greater than 2, `a` is still a list of 2n integers, `b` and `c` are still sorted lists of n integers, `req` is still an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is still 3. A new list `l` is created containing the 2nd element of `b`. If `k` is 0, we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
