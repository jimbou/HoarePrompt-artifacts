Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, ans1 is an empty list, ans2 is an empty list, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, l is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n):
    if k == 0:
        break
    if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
        ans1.append(b[i])
        ans1.append(b[i])
        k -= 2
    elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
        l.append(b[i - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is greater than 0, q is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an even integer equal to twice its original value, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is 1. If b[i] is equal to b[i - 1], then k is decreased by 2, ans1 contains two copies of the current value of b[i]. If b[i] is not equal to b[i - 1], then if k is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. l contains b[i - 1] if b[i - 1] is not in ans1, otherwise l is an empty list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 2. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` contains two additional elements equal to `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` does not contain `b[i - 1]` and `l` is a list containing the value of `b[1]`. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` contains two additional elements equal to `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` does not contain `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[1]` and `b[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 4. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the 4th element of `b` is equal to the 3rd element of `b`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the 4th element of `b`. If the 4th element of `b` is not equal to the 3rd element of `b`, then if the 3rd element of `b` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list containing the 3rd element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 5. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If the 5th element of `b` is equal to the 4th element of `b`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` is a list containing two copies of the 5th element of `b`. If the 5th element of `b` is not equal to the 4th element of `b`, then if the 4th element of `b` is not in `ans1`, `l` is a list containing the 4th element of `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
