The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`ans1` is a list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 4, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` has two additional elements equal to `b[i]` and `k` is equal to `k - 2`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then if the element at index `i-1` of `b` is not in `ans1`, `l` contains the element at index 2 of `b`.**
