Output State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `l` contains the element at index `i - 1` of `b`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. The element at index `i` of `b` is not equal to the element at index `i - 1` of `b`. The current value of `b[i - 1]` is in `l` but not in `ans1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `l` now contains the element at index `i - 1` of `b`, which is not equal to the element at index `i` of `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The element at index `i - 1` of `b` is now in `l` but still not in `ans1`.
