Output State: **ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is a list with four elements equal to c[i], i is 4, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1, q is 1, t is greater than 1, n is greater than 4, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and k is either equal to req - 4 or req - 6.**

The code snippet appends `c[i]` to `ans2` twice, effectively adding two elements equal to `c[i]` to `ans2`. Since `ans2` was either an empty list or a list with two or four elements equal to `c[i]`, it now becomes a list with four elements equal to `c[i]`. The value of `k` is decreased by 2, making it either equal to `req - 4` or `req - 6`. No other variables are affected by the code snippet.
