Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `q` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an even integer equal to twice its original value, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 3. If `k` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `k` is decreased by 2 and `ans1` contains two additional elements equal to `b[i]`. If `b[i]` is not equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` does not contain `b[i - 1]`. If `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `b[1]` and `b[i - 1]`.***
