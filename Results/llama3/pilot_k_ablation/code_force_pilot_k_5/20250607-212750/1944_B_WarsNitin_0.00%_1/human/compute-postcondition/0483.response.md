Output State: **`ans1` is a list containing the element at index i of l, `ans2` is a list containing the element at index i of l, `i` is 1, `q` is equal to 2, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, `a` is a list of len(a) integers, `l` must have at least 2 elements and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables maintain their initial values, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
