Output State: **ans1 is a list of pairs of equal elements from b, ans2 is an empty list, i is equal to n, l is a list of elements from b that are not in ans1 and includes the last element of b, q is equal to 1, t is greater than 1, n is equal to the value of the first input integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and k is equal to 0 or a positive even number.**

In this output state, the only change is that the last element of b is now included in the list l. The other variables remain unchanged. The list l now contains all elements from b that are not in ans1, including the last element of b.
