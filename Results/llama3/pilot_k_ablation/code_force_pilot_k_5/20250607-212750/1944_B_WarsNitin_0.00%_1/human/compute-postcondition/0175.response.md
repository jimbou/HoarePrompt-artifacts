Output State: **t is greater than 1, q is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, n is an integer and must be at least the original value of n, a is a list of 2n integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of n integers, req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k minus 4 if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise req is an even integer equal to twice the original value of k, i is equal to the original value of n, ans1 is a list containing all the elements of b that appear twice, ans2 is a list containing four copies of c[i] if c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], otherwise ans2 is a list containing two copies of c[i] plus two additional copies of c[i], l is a list containing all the elements of b that appear once and are not in ans1. If b[n - 1] is not in ans1, then l also contains b[n - 1]. If c[i] is equal to c[i - 1], then k is equal to its original value minus 2. Otherwise, the program maintains the current value of k.**

This output state means that after the loop executes all its iterations, the values of `t`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `req` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is now equal to the original value of `n`. The list `ans1` still contains all the elements of `b` that appear twice. The list `ans2` contains four copies of `c[i]` if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise it contains two copies of `c[i]` plus two additional copies of `c[i]`. The list `l` contains all the elements of `b` that appear once and are not in `ans1`, and if `b[n - 1]` is not in `ans1`, then `l` also contains `b[n - 1]`. The value of `k` is equal to its original value minus 2 if `c[i]` is equal to `c[i - 1]`, otherwise it maintains its current value.
