Output State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is equal to `n`, `k` is equal to `req`, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to `len(l) + 1` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated to be equal to `req`, while all other variables remain unchanged. The lists `ans1`, `ans2`, `l`, `b`, `c`, and `a` retain their original properties, and the relationships between `q`, `t`, and `len(l)` are still valid.
