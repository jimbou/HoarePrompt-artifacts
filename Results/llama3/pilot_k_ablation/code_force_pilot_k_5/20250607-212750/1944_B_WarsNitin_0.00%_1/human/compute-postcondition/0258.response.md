Output State: **ans2 contains four copies of the current value of c[i], k is equal to req - 4, all other variables remain unchanged**

The code block modifies the state of `ans2` and `k`. The first two lines append the current value of `c[i]` to `ans2` twice, resulting in `ans2` containing four copies of `c[i]`. The third line decrements `k` by 2, making it equal to `req - 4`. All other variables, including `ans1`, `i`, `l`, `t`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a`, remain unchanged.
