To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

State: **`ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to 2 times the value of the second input integer, `l` is an empty list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, and stdin contains no inputs.**
