Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `q` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of 2n integers, `b` is a sorted list of n integers, `c` is a sorted list of n integers, `req` is an even integer equal to twice the original value of `k`, `i` is 1, `ans1` is an empty list, `ans2` is an empty list, `l` is an empty list. The current value of `b[i]` is equal to the current value of `b[i - 1]`. If `k` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
