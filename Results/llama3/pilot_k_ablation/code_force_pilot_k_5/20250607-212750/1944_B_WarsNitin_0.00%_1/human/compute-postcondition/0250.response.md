Output State: **`ans1` is a list containing all the duplicate elements from `b`, each appearing twice, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `k` is equal to 0, `l` is a list containing all the non-duplicate elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to `len(l)` if the last element of `b` is in `ans1`, otherwise `q` is equal to `len(l)`, `t` is greater than `len(l) + 1`, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
