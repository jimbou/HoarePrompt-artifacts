Postcondition: ***`ans1`, `ans2` are lists, `i` is 1, `l` is a list, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers. If `b[i]` is equal to `b[i - 1]`, then `ans1` contains two copies of the current value of `b[i]` and `k` is reduced by 2. Otherwise, `l` contains the element at index `i - 1` of `b` if `b[i - 1]` is not in `ans1`, otherwise `l` is an empty list.***
