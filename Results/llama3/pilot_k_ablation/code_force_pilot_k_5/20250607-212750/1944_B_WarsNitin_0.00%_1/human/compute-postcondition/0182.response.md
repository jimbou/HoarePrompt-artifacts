Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` both have the value of `l[i]` appended to them, `i` is incremented by 1, `k` remains 0 if it was 0 before the code execution, all other variables retain their original values and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `ans1` and `ans2` remain the same as they were before the code execution, with the value of `l[i]` appended to them. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `k` remains 0 if it was 0 before the code execution. All other variables retain their original values. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
