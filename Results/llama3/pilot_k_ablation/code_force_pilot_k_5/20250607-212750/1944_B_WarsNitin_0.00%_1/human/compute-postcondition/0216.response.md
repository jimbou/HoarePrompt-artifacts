Output State: **`ans1` and `ans2` are lists, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `n` is an integer and at least 2, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `req` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `ans1`, `ans2`, `i`, `n`, `b`, `c`, and `a` remain unchanged. The value of `req` is now 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
