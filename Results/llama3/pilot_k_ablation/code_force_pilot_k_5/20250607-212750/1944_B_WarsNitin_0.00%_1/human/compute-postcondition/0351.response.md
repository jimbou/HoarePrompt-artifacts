Output State: **`ans1` is a list of pairs of equal elements from `b`, `ans2` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `l` is a list of elements from `b` that are not in `ans1`, `q` is equal to 1, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is greater than 1, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `c` is a sorted list of `len(a) - n` integers, `a` is a list of `len(a)` integers, `k` is equal to `req` and is currently equal to 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged.
