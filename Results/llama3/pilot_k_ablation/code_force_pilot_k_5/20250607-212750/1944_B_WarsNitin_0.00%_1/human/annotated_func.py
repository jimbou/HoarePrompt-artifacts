#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4, 1 <= k <= floor(n/2)). The second line contains 2n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_2n (1 <= a_i <= n). Every integer from 1 to n occurs exactly twice in a. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 * 10^4.
    t = int(input())
    for q in range(t):
        n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        b = a[:n]
        
        c = a[n:]
        
        b.sort()
        
        c.sort()
        
        ans1 = []

        req = k
        
        l = []
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            if b[i] == b[i - 1]:
                ans1.append(b[i])
                ans1.append(b[i])
                k -= 2
            elif b[i - 1] not in ans1:
                l.append(b[i - 1])
        
        if b[n - 1] not in ans1:
            l.append(b[n - 1])
        
        k = req
        
        for i in range(1, n):
            if k == 0:
                break
            if c[i] == c[i - 1]:
                ans2.append(c[i])

                k -= 2
        
        for i in range(len(l)):
            if k == 0:
                break
            ans1.append(l[i])
            ans2.append(l[i])

        print(*ans2)
        
    #State: ans1 is a list containing all the duplicate elements from b, each appearing twice, and all the elements from l, ans2 is a list containing two copies of each duplicate element from c and all the elements from l, i is equal to len(l), k is equal to 0, l is an empty list, q is equal to t, t is greater than or equal to 0, n is an integer, b is a sorted list of n integers, c is a sorted list of len(a) - n integers, a is a list of len(a) integers, and all the elements of ans2 are printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains 2n integers. The function then processes these integers to create two lists, ans1 and ans2, containing duplicate elements from the input, and prints the elements of ans2. The function repeats this process for all test cases.
