Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by finding two arrays l and r each of length 2k such that l is a subset of [a_1, a_2, \ldots a_n] and r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \ldots a_{2n}] and the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

The program first sorts the input arrays b and c. Then it iterates over the sorted arrays to find duplicate elements and adds them to ans1 and ans2. If there are remaining elements in l that have not been added to ans1 and ans2, it adds them to both arrays. This ensures that the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

The program correctly handles the case where k is less than or equal to n/2, as required by the problem statement. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple solutions, as it can output any one of them.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
