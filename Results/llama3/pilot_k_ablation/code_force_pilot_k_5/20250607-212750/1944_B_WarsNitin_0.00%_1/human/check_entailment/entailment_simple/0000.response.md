Reasoning: The given Python program is correct. It correctly solves the problem by finding two arrays l and r each of length 2k such that l is a subset of [a_1, a_2, ..., a_n] and r is a subset of [a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, ..., a_{2n}] and the bitwise XOR of elements of l is equal to the bitwise XOR of elements of r.

The program first reads the input and initializes the necessary variables. It then sorts the first half of the array a and the second half of the array a separately. It then iterates over the sorted arrays to find the duplicate elements and adds them to the answer arrays ans1 and ans2. If there are remaining elements in the arrays that are not duplicates, it adds them to the answer arrays as well.

The program then prints the answer arrays ans1 and ans2.

Correctness: **True**
