Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly solves the problem by first sorting the two halves of the array and then constructing the two subsets `l` and `r` by selecting pairs of equal elements from the sorted halves. If there are remaining elements that are not part of a pair, they are added to both `l` and `r` to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` is equal.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If `k` is 1, the program selects the first pair of equal elements from the sorted halves and adds them to `l` and `r`.
* If `k` is greater than 1, the program selects pairs of equal elements from the sorted halves and adds them to `l` and `r` until `k` pairs have been selected.
* If there are remaining elements that are not part of a pair, they are added to both `l` and `r` to ensure that the XOR of the elements in `l` and `r` is equal.

The program also handles edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is 2 and `k` is 1, or when `n` is 4 and `k` is 2.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
