Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000).**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to be the first two positive integers from the input, and the stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each with two positive integers. The value of `t` is still a positive integer between 1 and 1000.
