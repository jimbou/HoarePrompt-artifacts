Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). Additionally, n is larger than or equal to k, and n is not equal to k. The current value of `k-1` is less than the current value of `n-k+1`, 'YES' is being printed, and the number 2 is being printed, and this is printed: the value of `n - k + 1` and the number 1**
