Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). Additionally, n is larger than or equal to k, and n is not equal to k. Also, k - 1 is not less than n - k + 1, and 'NO' is being printed**
