Functionality: **Determines if a given pair of positive integers `n` and `k` can be combined in a specific way and prints the result. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO'. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 1. If `n` is larger than `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1` and prints 'YES' followed by the number 2, the value of `n-k+1`, and the number 1 if true, otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
