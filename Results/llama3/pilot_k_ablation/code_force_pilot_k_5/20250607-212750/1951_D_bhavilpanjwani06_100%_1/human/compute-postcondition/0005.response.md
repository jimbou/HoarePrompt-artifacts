Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). Additionally, n is larger than or equal to k. The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`.***
