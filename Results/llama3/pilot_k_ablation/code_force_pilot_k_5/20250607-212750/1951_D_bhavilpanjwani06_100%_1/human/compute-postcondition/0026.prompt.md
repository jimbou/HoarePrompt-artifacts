You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18).
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    if (n < k) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        if (n == k) :
            print('YES')
            #This is printed: YES
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
            print(1)
            #This is printed: 1
        else :
            if (k - 1 < n - k + 1) :
                print('YES')
                #This is printed: YES
                print(2)
                #This is printed: 2
                print(n - k + 1, 1)
                #This is printed: n - k + 1 (where n - k + 1 is a positive integer), 1
            else :
                print('NO')
                #This is printed: NO
            #State: *`n` and `k` are positive integers, `n` is larger than or equal to `k`, and `n` is not equal to `k`. stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). If `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the value of `n-k+1`, and the number 1. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1. If `n` is not equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the value of `n-k+1`, and the number 1, if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.
    #State: *`n` and `k` are positive integers, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1. If `n` is larger than `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the value of `n-k+1`, and the number 1, if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). The current value of `n` is less than the current value of `k`, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_2: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). Additionally, n is larger than or equal to k, and n is not equal to k. Also, k - 1 is not less than n - k + 1, and 'NO' is being printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Use Natural language easily understandable by humans and strictly reply with the format: Functionality: ** your response here **
