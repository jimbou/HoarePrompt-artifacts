Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two positive integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 10^18), where t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 1000). If `n` is less than `k`, 'NO' is printed. If `n` is equal to `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 1. If `n` is larger than `k`, 'YES' is printed, followed by the number 2, the value of `n-k+1`, and the number 1, if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
