Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly handles all possible cases:

- If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels.
- If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' and sets up one stall with a price of 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels.
- If n is larger than k, it checks if k-1 is less than n-k+1. If true, it prints 'YES' and sets up two stalls with prices n-k+1 and 1, allowing Alice to buy exactly k jewels. If false, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly k jewels.

The program correctly implements the greedy strategy of Alice and the constraints of Bob's store. It also handles the edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**
