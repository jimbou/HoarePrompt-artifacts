Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if Bob can set up at most 60 stalls and set the prices for the stalls such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If n is less than k, it prints 'NO' because Alice cannot buy k jewels with less than k coins.

2. If n is equal to k, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 1 and the price 1. This is because Alice can buy k jewels with k coins if the price of each jewel is 1.

3. If n is larger than k, it checks if k-1 is less than n-k+1. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 2, the value of n-k+1, and the price 1. This is because Alice can buy k-1 jewels with n-k+1 coins if the price of each jewel is 1, and then buy 1 more jewel with the remaining coins if the price of each jewel is 1.

4. If none of the above conditions are true, it prints 'NO' because it is impossible for Bob to set up the stalls and prices such that Alice buys exactly k jewels.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output for each case.

Correctness: **True**
