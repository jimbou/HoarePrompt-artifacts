Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly handles all possible cases:

1. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible for Alice to buy exactly `k` jewels with less than `k` coins.

2. If `n` is equal to `k`, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 1, indicating that Alice can buy exactly `k` jewels with `n` coins by setting the price of each jewel to 1.

3. If `n` is larger than `k`, it checks if `k-1` is less than `n-k+1`. If true, it prints 'YES' followed by the number 2, the value of `n-k+1`, and the number 1. This is because Alice can buy `k-1` jewels at the first stall with price `n-k+1` and 1 jewel at the second stall with price 1, leaving her with 0 coins. If `k-1` is not less than `n-k+1`, it prints 'NO' because it's impossible to set the prices such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and prints the correct output based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
