Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when `n` is greater than `k` and `k - 1` is greater than or equal to `n - k + 1`. In this case, the program prints 'NO', but it is actually possible to set up the stalls such that Alice buys exactly `k` jewels.

For example, if `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the program prints 'NO', but it is possible to set up the stalls with prices `4, 3, 2, 1` to make Alice buy exactly `3` jewels.

The correct solution should consider all possible cases and provide a correct output for each case.
