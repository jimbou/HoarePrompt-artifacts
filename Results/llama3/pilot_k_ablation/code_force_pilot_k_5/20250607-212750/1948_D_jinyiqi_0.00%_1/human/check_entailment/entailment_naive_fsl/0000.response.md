Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for the case when the input string contains only one character, which is a question mark. In this case, the program should print 2, because the longest tandem repeat substring that can be formed by replacing the question mark with a lowercase Latin letter is "aa". However, the program prints 0, because it does not handle this special case correctly.

Here is the incorrect part of the code:

```
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
```

This loop starts from `n // 2`, which means it will not consider the case when `n` is 1. To fix this, the loop should start from `n`, not `n // 2`. 

Here is the corrected code:

```
for j in range(n, 0, -1):
```

With this correction, the program will work correctly for all cases, including the one mentioned above.
