Output State: **`count` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `n - j`, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is less than `n - j`. If `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n - j`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `count` will be either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to the difference between `n` and `j`. The values of `j` and `n` remain unchanged, with `j` being at least 0 and `n` being greater than `j`. The value of `k` will be less than the difference between `n` and `j`. If the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` in the string `s` are either '?' or equal to each other, then `count` will be a positive integer less than or equal to `n - j`. Otherwise, `count` will be 0.
