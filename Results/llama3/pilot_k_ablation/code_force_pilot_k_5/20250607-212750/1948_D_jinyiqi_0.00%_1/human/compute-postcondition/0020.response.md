Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n // 2 + 1`, `count` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been reset to 0, while the values of `stdin`, `t`, `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged. The conditions related to the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` of string `s` and the value of `count` are no longer applicable since `count` has been reset.
