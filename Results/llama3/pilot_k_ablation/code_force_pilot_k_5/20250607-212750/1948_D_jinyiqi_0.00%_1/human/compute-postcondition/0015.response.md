Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is 1 plus its previous value which was not equal to `j` but now it can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`. If either the character at index `k` of string `s` is '?' or the character at index `k + j` of string `s` is '?' or the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` of string `s` are the same, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal and neither of them is a question mark.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings. The value of `n` is still at least 4, and `j` and `k` are still equal to `n // 2` and `n - j`, respectively. The condition for `count` being 1 or 0 is still the same, but now `count` can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`.
