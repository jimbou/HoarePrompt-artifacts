Output State: **`count` is 1 or 2, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 1. If `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. If `count` was initially 0, it is now 1. If `count` was initially 1, it is now 2. The values of `j`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The condition that determines the value of `count` is still valid, but now `count` is either 1 or 2, depending on the initial value of `count` and the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`.
