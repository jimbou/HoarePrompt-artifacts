Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` must be at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, `k` is 0. Additionally, `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal and neither of them is a question mark.**

The code sets the value of `count` to 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings. The relationship between `n` and `j` is still valid, and `k` remains 0. The conditions for `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are also still valid.
