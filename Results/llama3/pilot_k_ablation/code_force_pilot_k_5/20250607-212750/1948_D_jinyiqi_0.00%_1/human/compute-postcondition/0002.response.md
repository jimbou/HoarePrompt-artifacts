To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `k`, `n`, and `j`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `n - j` is greater than 0, because the range function will generate at least one value (0) if `n - j` is 1 or more.
2. Since `j` is `n // 2`, we know that `j` is at least 1 (because `n` must be at least 2).
3. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 3, so that `n - j` is at least 1.

The states of `stdin`, `t`, and `count` do not affect the execution of the loop, so they do not need to be adjusted.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` must be at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0, `k` is 0**
