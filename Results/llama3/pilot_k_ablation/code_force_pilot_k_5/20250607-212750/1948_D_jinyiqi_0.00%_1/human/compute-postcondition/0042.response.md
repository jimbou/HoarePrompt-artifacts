Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1, `n - j` is greater than 1. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is a question mark, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 0 if `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` and neither of them is a question mark, otherwise `count` is 1.***
