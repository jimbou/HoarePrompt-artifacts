Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1, `count` is 2 if `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is a question mark, otherwise `count` is 1, `n - j` is greater than 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings. The values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still the same. The value of `count` is now 2 if `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is a question mark, otherwise it is 1. The condition `n - j` is greater than 1 is still valid.
