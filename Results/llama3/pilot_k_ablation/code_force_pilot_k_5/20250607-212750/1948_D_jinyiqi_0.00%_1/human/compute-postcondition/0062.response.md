Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0, `s[k]`, `s[k + j]` are not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**

The code `count = 0` resets the value of `count` to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings. The values of `n`, `j`, `k`, `s[k]`, and `s[k + j]` are still the same as in the initial state.
