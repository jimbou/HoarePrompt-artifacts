The only variables in the loop head are variable `k`, `n` and `j`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `n` and `j`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `n - j - 1`, `n` is at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 1 so `k` is `n - j` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `n` and `j` must be `n // 2`. 
State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`. If either the character at index `k` of string `s` is '?' or the character at index `k + j` of string `s` is '?' or the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` of string `s` are the same, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal and neither of them is a question mark. `count` is not equal to `j`.**
