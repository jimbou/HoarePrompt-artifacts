Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the same input, and the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still the same. The condition that `count` is not equal to `j` is still valid.
