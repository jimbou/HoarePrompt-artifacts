Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 1, `k` is 0, and either the character at index `k` of string `s` is '?' or the character at index `k + j` of string `s` is '?' or the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` of string `s` are the same.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and conditions. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing an integer `t` followed by `t` strings. The relationship between `n` and `j` is still valid, with `j` being half of `n`. The condition regarding the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` of string `s` also holds true.
