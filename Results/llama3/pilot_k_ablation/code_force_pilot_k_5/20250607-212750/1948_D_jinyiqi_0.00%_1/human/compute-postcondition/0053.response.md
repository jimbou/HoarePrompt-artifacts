Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 7, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 4, `n - j` is greater than 4, `count` is 0.**

The code sets the value of `count` to 0, regardless of the previous conditions. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings, and the conditions on `n`, `j`, `k`, and `n - j` are still valid.
