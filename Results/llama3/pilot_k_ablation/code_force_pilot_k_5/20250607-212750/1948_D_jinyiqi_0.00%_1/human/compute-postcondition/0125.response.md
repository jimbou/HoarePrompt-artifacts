Postcondition: ***`count`, `j`, `n`, `k` are integers. `count` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 1, `k` is less than `n - j`. If `s[k]` is equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
