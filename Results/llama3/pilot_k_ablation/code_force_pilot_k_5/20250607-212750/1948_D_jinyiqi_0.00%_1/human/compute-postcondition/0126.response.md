The only variable in the loop head is variable k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable k and n - j. If k is less than n - j, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, k is at least 1, n - j is greater than k. For the loop to execute again k must be increased by 1 and n - j must be greater than k.
State: **`count` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 2`, `k` is at least 2, `k` is less than `n - j`. If `s[k]` is equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. Otherwise, `count` is 0.**
