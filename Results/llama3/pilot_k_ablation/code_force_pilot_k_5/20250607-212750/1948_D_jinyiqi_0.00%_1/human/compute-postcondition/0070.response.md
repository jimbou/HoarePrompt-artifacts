Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2 - 1`. `count` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, while all other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The stdin still contains the input data, and the relationships between `n`, `j`, and `k` are still valid.
