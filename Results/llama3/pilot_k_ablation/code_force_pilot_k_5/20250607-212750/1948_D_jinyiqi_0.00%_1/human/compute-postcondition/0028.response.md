Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is the old value of `k` plus 2, `count` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings, and the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still the same as before.
