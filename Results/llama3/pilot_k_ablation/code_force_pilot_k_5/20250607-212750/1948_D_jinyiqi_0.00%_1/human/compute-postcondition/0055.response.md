Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is `j` if all pairs of characters `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are equal or either of them is a question mark for all `k` in range `[0, n - j)`, otherwise `count` is less than `j`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has checked all pairs of characters `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` for all `k` in the range `[0, n - j)`. If all pairs of characters are equal or either of them is a question mark, then the `count` is equal to `j`. Otherwise, the `count` is less than `j`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `j` remain unchanged, and `k` has reached its final value of `n - j`.
