The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `n // 2 - 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` is at least 1, so `n // 2 - 1` is at least 0. Therefore, `k` is `n - (n // 2 - 1)`, which is `n - n // 2 + 1`, which is `n // 2 + 1`. Since `count` is either 0 or a value equal to `j`, `count` is either 0 or `n // 2 - 1`.

State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n // 2 + 1`, `count` is either 0 or `n // 2 - 1**
