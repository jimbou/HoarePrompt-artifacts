Output State: **`count` is 0, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is n - j + 1**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The values of `j`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, with `j` still being at least 0, `n` still being greater than `j`, and `k` still being equal to `n - j + 1`.
