Output State: **`count` is either 1, 2, or 3, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 2**

The value of `count` is incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, or 3. The values of the other variables are not affected, so `j` is still at least 0, `n` is still greater than `j + 1`, and `k` is still at least 2.
