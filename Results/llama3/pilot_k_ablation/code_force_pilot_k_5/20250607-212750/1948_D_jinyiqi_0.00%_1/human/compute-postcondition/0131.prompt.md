Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n // 2, 0, -1):
    count = 0
    for k in range(0, n - j):
        if s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j]:
            count += 1
        else:
            count = 0
        if count == j:
            print(count * 2)
            return


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is either 0 or a value equal to `j`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is `j` if all pairs of characters `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are equal or either of them is a question mark for all `k` in range `[0, n - j)`, otherwise `count` is less than `j`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The loop will execute until `k` reaches `n - j`, at which point `k` will be out of range for the loop condition `range(0, n - j)`. At this point, the loop will terminate, and the final value of `count` will be printed if it is equal to `j`. If `count` is not equal to `j`, the loop will terminate without printing anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `count` is 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n - j, `j` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is n - j. If `s[k]` is equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `count` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `n - j`, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is less than `n - j`. If `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is a positive integer less than or equal to `n - j`. Otherwise, `count` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
