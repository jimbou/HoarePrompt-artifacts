Postcondition: ***stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. n is at least 2 and greater than j, j is n // 2 - 2, k is n // 2. If s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j], then count is either 1, 3 or 4. Otherwise, count is 0.***
