Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 5, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is the old value of `k` plus 2. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` equals `s[k + j]`, then `count` is either 2, 3, 4, or `j` plus its previous value (which was not equal to `j` but now can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`). Otherwise, `count` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The input contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The value of `n` is at least 5, and `j` is half of `n`. The value of `k` is increased by 2 from its previous value. The value of `count` is increased by 1 from its previous value, which was either 1, 2, 3, or `j` plus its previous value (which was not equal to `j` but now can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`).
