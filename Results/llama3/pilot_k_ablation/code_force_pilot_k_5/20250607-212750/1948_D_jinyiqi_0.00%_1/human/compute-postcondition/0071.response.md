Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2 - 1`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 3. If `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 0. Otherwise, `count` is 2.***
