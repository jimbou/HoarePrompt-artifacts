Output State: **`count` is 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., n - j, `j` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is n - j. If `s[k]` is equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `count` variable will have a value between 0 and `n - j` (inclusive), `j` will still be at least 1, `n` will still be greater than `j`, and `k` will be equal to `n - j`. The value of `count` will depend on the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` for each iteration of the loop. If `s[k]` is equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` will remain 0.
