Output State: **`count` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `j` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The values of `j`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, so `j` is still at least 1, `n` is still greater than `j`, and `k` is still 3.
