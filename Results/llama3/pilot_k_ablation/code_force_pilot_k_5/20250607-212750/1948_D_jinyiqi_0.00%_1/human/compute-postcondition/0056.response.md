The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, which is at least 1 since `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be decreased by 1, so `j` is `n // 2 - 2`.
State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is `j` if all pairs of characters `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are equal or either of them is a question mark for all `k` in range `[0, n - j)`, otherwise `count` is less than `j`.**
