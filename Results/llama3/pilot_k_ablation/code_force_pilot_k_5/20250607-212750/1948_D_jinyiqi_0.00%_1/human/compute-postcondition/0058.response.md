The only variables in the loop head are variables  k, n and j, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `j`. If `n - j` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n - j`, `count` is 0 and `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. So for the loop to be executed  `n` must be greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2` and `k` is 0.
State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0**
