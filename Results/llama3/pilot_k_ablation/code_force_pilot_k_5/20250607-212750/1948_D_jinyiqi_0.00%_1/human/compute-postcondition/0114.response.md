The only variables in the loop head are variables  k, n and j, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `n` and `j`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j`, `n` is greater than `k + j`. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 1 so `k` is at least 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `k + j` so `n` is greater than `j + 1`. 
State: **`count` is 0 or 1, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 1. If `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.**
