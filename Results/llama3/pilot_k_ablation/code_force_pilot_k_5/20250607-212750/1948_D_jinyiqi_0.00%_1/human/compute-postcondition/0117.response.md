Postcondition: ***`count`, `j`, `n`, `k` are integers. `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 1. If `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?', then `count` is 2. If `s[k]` is not '?' and not equal to `s[k + j]`, and `s[k + j]` is not '?', then `count` is 0. Otherwise, `count` is 1.***
