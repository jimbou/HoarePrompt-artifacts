Postcondition: ***`count` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 2`, `k` is at least 2, `k` is less than `n - j`. If `s[k]` is equal to `?`, `s[k + j]` is equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
