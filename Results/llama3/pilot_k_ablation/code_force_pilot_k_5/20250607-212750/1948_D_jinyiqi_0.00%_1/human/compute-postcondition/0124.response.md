Output State: **`count` is 0, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 1, `k` is less than `n - j`**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been reset to 0, while the values of `j`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The conditions that `n` is greater than `j + 1` and `k` is less than `n - j` are still valid.
