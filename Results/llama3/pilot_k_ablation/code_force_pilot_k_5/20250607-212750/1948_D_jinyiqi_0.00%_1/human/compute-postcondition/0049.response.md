Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 6, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 3, `n - j` is greater than 3, and `count` is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to 0, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings, and the relationships between `n`, `j`, and `k` are still valid.
