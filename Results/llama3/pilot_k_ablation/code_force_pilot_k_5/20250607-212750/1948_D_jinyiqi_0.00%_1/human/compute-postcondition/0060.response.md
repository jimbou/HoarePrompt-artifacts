Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is 0, `count` is 1. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or equal to `s[k + j]`, or `s[k + j]` is '?'**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `count` has been incremented by 1, so its new value is 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
