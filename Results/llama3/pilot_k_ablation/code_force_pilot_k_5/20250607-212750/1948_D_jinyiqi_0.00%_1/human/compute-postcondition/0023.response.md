Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is the old value of `k` plus 1, `count` is either 1, 2, 3, or `j` plus its previous value (which was not equal to `j` but now can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`).**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `count` can now be 1, 2, 3, or `j` plus its previous value, which was not equal to `j` but now can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings, and the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` remain the same.
