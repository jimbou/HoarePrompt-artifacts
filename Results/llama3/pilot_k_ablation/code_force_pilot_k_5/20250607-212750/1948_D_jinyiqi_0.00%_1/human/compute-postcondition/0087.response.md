Output State: **`count` is 0, `j` is at least 1, `n` is greater than `j`, `k` is 0, and either `s[k]` is not equal to `?`, or `s[k + j]` is not equal to `?`, or `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `count`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The precondition that `count` is 0 is still valid after the code has been executed, and the other preconditions remain unchanged.
