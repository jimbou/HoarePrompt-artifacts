The only variables in the loop head are variables  k, n and j, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k`, `n` and `j`. If `k` is less than `n - j`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is `n // 2 - 1`, `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`. For the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 1 so `k` is `n // 2` and for the loop to execute again `n - j` must be greater than `n // 2`. 
State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2`, `count` is either 0, 2 or 3**
