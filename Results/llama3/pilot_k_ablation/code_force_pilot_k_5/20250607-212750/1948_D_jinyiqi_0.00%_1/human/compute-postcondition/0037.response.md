Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0, `count` is 0, `n - j` is greater than 0. Additionally, `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal, and neither of them is a question mark.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state because the code only assigns a value of 0 to the variable `count`, which was already 0 in the initial state. Therefore, none of the variables have changed, and the output state remains the same as the initial state.
