The code prints the value of `count` multiplied by 2.
Since `count` is either 0 or `j`, and `j` is `n // 2`, the printed value will be either 0 or `n`.
Output: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 3, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is 0. If either the character at index `k` of string `s` is '?' or the character at index `k + j` of string `s` is '?' or the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` of string `s` are the same, then the current value of `count` is `j`. Otherwise, `count` is 0 and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal and neither of them is a question mark, and the value of count * 2 is printed which is either 0 or n.**
