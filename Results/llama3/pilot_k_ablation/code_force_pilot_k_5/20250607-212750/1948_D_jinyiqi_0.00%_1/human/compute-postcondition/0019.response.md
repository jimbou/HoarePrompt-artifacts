Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 4, `j` is `n // 2`, `k` is `n // 2 + 1`. If either the character at index `k` of string `s` is '?' or the character at index `k + j` of string `s` is '?' or the characters at indices `k` and `k + j` of string `s` are the same, then `count` is 2 plus its previous value which was not equal to `j` but now it can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`. Otherwise, `count` is 1 and `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are not equal and neither of them is a question mark.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The conditions for updating `count` remain the same, but now `count` can be equal to `j` if its previous value was `j-1`.
