Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2`, `count` is either 1, 3 or 4**

The code increments the value of `count` by 1. Since `count` was initially either 0, 2, or 3, it is now either 1, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
