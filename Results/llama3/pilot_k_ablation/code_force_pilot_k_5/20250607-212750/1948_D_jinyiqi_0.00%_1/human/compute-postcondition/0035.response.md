Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 0, `count` is 1, `n - j` is greater than 0. The current value of `s[k]` is either '?' or the current value of `s[k + j]` is '?' or the current value of `s[k]` is equal to the current value of `s[k + j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The input in `stdin` is still the same, and the conditions on `n`, `j`, `k`, and the relationship between `s[k]` and `s[k + j]` are still valid.
