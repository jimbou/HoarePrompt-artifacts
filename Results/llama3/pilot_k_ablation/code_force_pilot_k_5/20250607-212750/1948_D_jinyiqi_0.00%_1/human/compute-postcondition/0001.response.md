Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` must be at least 2, `j` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0**

In natural language, the output state is: The input contains an integer `t` between 1 and 1000, followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. The variable `n` must be at least 2, and `j` is equal to half of `n`. A new variable `count` has been introduced and is initialized to 0.
