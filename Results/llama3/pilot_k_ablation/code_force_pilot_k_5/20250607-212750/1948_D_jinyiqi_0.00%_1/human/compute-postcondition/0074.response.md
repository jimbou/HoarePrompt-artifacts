Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `n // 2`, `count` is 0**

The code sets the value of `count` to 0. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin remains the same, containing an integer `t` followed by `t` strings. The relationships between `n`, `j`, and `k` remain unchanged.
