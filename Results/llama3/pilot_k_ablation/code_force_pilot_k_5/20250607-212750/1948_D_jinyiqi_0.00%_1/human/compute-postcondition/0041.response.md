Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 1, `count` is 0, `n - j` is greater than 1**

The code sets the value of `count` to 0, regardless of the previous value of `count`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `count` is no longer dependent on the values of `s[k]` and `s[k + j]`. The rest of the conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
