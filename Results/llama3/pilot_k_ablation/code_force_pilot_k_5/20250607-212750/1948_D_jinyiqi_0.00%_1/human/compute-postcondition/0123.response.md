The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, so the value of `count` is now 1, 2, 3, or 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 1, `k` is less than `n - j`.
Output State: **`count` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 1, `k` is less than `n - j`.**
