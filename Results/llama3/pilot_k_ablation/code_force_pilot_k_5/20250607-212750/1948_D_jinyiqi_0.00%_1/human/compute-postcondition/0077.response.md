Output State: **`stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. n is at least 2 and greater than j, j is n // 2 - 2, k is n // 2 + 1. If s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j], then count is either 2, 4 or 5. Otherwise, count is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been incremented by 1. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an integer t followed by t strings, and the relationships between n, j, and k are still valid. The condition for `count` has been updated to reflect the increment operation.
