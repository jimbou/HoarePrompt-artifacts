Postcondition: ***`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 7, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is 4, `n - j` is greater than 4. If `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]` or either of them is a question mark, then `count` is 5. If `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` and neither of them is a question mark, then `count` is 3. If `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` and either of them is a question mark, then `count` is 4. If `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` and neither of them is a question mark, and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]` and either of them is a question mark, then `count` is 2. If none of the above conditions are met, then `count` is 1. Otherwise, `count` is 0.***
