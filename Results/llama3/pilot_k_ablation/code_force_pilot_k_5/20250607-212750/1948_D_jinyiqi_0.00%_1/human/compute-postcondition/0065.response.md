Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, `j` is `n // 2 - 2`, `k` is `k + 1`. If `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, then `count` is 2. Otherwise, `count` is 1 and `s[k]`, `s[k + j]` are not equal to '?' and `s[k]` is not equal to `s[k + j]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `count` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `count` is now 2 if `s[k]` is '?' or `s[k + j]` is '?' or `s[k]` is equal to `s[k + j]`, otherwise it is 1. The input in `stdin` and the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are the same as before.
