Output State: **`count` is 0, `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, `k` is at least 2**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to 0, while the values of `j`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The conditions that `j` is at least 0, `n` is greater than `j + 1`, and `k` is at least 2 are still valid.
