Output State: **`count` is 0, `j` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, the loop will execute until `k` reaches `n - j`, at which point `k` will be out of range for the loop condition `range(0, n - j)`**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been initialized to 0. The value of `j` is still greater than 0 and has been decreased by 1. The loop condition remains the same, and the loop will continue to execute until `k` reaches `n - j`.
