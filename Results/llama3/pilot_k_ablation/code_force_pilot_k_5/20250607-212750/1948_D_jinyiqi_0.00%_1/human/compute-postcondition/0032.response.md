Output State: **`stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= `t` <= 1000) followed by `t` strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000, `n` is at least 2, `j` is `n // 2 - 1`, `k` is `n // 2 + 1`, `count` is 0**

In this output state, the value of `count` has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains an integer `t` followed by `t` strings, and the values of `n`, `j`, and `k` are still valid as per the initial state.
