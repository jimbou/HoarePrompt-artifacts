To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop condition. The loop head contains the variable `k` and the expression `n - j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is `n // 2` and `n` is at least 2 and greater than `j`, and `j` is `n // 2 - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be less than `n - j`. Since `k` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we can increment `k` by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `k` is `n // 2 + 1`.

The state of `n` and `j` remains the same, as they are not modified by the loop.

The state of `s` (stdin) and `count` is not relevant to the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust them.

The state of `t` is also not relevant to the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust it.

State: **`stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings, each consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, with a length between 1 and 5000. n is at least 2 and greater than j, j is n // 2 - 2, k is n // 2 + 1. If s[k] == '?' or s[k + j] == '?' or s[k] == s[k + j], then count is either 1, 3 or 4. Otherwise, count is 0.**
