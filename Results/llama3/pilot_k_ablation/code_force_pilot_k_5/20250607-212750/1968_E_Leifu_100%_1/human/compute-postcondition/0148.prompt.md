Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: a list of t integers (n) where 2 <= n <= 10^3
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    print('1 1')
    print('1 2')
    if n == 3:
        print('2 3')
    elif n >= 4:
        print('2 4')
        for j in range(4, n + 1):
            print(str(j) + ' ' + str(j))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n-1` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' has been printed, and '1 2' has been printed, and either '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is assigned the value `int(input())` where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed in the format 'x x'.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' has been printed, and '1 2' has been printed, and either '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin.pop(0))` where `stdin.pop(0)` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed in the format 'x x', and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is less than 4, the state remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
