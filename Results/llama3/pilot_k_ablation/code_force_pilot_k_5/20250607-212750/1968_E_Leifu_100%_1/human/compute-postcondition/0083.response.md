The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 7, `n` is greater than or equal to 7. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 8, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 8.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 8, `j` is 8, stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' has been printed, '4 4' has been printed, '5 5' has been printed, and '6 6' has been printed, and '7 7' is printed, and '8 8' is printed**
