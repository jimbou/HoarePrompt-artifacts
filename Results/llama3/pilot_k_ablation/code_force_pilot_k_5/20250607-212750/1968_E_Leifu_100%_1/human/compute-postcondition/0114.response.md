Output State: `t` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' has been printed, and '1 2' has been printed, and either '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is assigned the value `int(input())` where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and this is printed: '4 4', and '5 5' is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and this is printed: '6 6' if `n` is greater than or equal to 6, and this is printed: '7 7' if `n` is greater than or equal to 7, and this is printed: '8 8' if `n` is greater than or equal to 8, and this is printed: '9 9' if `n` is greater than or equal to 9, and this is printed: '10 10' if `n` is greater than or equal to 10, and so on up to `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 10.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 (inclusive), and the standard input is empty. The program has printed '1 1', '1 2', '1 2', and either '2 3' if `n` is 3 or '2 4' if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, followed by `n` and a space and `n` if `n` is greater than or equal to 4. Then, '1 1', '1 2', and '2 4' are printed. The loop variable `j` is equal to `n`. The program has also printed '4 4', and if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, it has printed '5 5', and if `n` is greater than or equal to 6, it has printed '6 6', and so on up to 'n n' if `n` is greater than or equal to 10.
