Output State: `t` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' has been printed, and '1 2' has been printed, and either '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin.pop(0))` where `stdin.pop(0)` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, `j` is `n`, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed in the format 'x x', and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), and the standard input is empty. The numbers '1 1', '1 2', '1 2', '2 3' (if `n` is 3) or '2 4' (if `n` is greater than or equal to 4), and `n` followed by a space and `n` (if `n` is greater than or equal to 4) have been printed. Additionally, '1 1', '1 2', and either '2 3' (if `n` is 3) or '2 4' (if `n` is greater than or equal to 4) have been printed. The value of `n` has been assigned the value of the integer input from the standard input. The numbers '1 1', '1 2', and '2 4' have been printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' has been printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' has been printed. The variable `j` is equal to `n`, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` have been printed in the format 'x x'. Finally, '1 1', '1 2', and '2 4' have been printed.
