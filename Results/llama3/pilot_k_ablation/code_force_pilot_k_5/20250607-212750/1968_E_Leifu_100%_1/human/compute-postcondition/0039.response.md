Based on the precondition, the code will print '2 3' when the print statement is executed.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The precondition states that if `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), and the specific case of `n` being 3 is mentioned, it implies that `n` is indeed 3 in this scenario.
* The print statement `print('2 3')` is executed, which simply prints the string '2 3' to the console.

Therefore, the output will be the string '2 3'.

Output: **2 3**
