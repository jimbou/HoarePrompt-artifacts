To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4 and `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3 (inclusive). To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables, `t`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' is printed, j is 5**
