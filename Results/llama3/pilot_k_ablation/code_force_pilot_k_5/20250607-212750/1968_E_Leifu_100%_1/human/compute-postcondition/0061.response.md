To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `t` is greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The value of `t` remains the same, but we know that `t` is greater than 1, so it must be at least 2.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n-1` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.**
