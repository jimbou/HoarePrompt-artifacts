According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 7, `n` is an integer between 7 and 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 8, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 8.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 8 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' is printed, j is 8, and this is printed: '5 5', and this is printed: '6 6', and this is printed: '7 7'**
