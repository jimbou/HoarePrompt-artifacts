The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed.**
