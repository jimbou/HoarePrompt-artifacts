Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 (inclusive) but not equal to 3, stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), this is printed: `j` + ' ' + `j`.

This output state means that after the loop executes all the iterations, the values of `t`, `i`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged. The loop has printed all the numbers from 4 to `n` (inclusive) along with their squares.
