The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.
State: **`t` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' has been printed, and '1 2' has been printed, and either '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin.pop(0))` where `stdin.pop(0)` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, `j` is 5, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed in the format 'x x', and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and '4 4' is printed**
