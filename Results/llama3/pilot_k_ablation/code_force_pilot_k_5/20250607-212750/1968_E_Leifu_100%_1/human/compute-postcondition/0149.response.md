Functionality: **This function reads a positive integer t from standard input, followed by t integers n, each between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive). It then prints a series of lines to standard output, where each series consists of '1 1', '1 2', and either '2 3' (if n is 3) or '2 4' followed by 'j j' for all integers j from 4 to n (inclusive). The function repeats this process t times, emptying the standard input in the process.**
