The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is an integer greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 5, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' has been printed, `j` is 5, and this is printed: '4 4'**
