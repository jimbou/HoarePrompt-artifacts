Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` has been updated to the integer input from stdin, which is now empty. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The print statements that were previously printed remain the same.
