The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n-1` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, `j` is 5, and "5 5" is printed**
