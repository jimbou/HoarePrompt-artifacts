The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 7, `n` is greater than 6 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 8 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 7.
State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 7 and less than or equal to 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n-1` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed, '2 4' has been printed, '4 4' has been printed, '4 4' has been printed, '5 5' has been printed, '5 5' has been printed, `j` is 8, '6 6' has been printed, '7 7' has been printed**
