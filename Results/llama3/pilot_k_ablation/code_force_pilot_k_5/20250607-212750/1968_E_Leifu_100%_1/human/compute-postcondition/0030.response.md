Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10^3 (inclusive) but not equal to 3, stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will include all the initial conditions that were not affected by the loop, such as `t` being greater than 0, `i` being 0, and the presence of a list of `n` integers in stdin. Additionally, the numbers '1 1', '1 2', and '2 4' will have been printed. The loop will have iterated from `j = 4` to `j = n`, printing each value of `j` followed by a space and itself.
