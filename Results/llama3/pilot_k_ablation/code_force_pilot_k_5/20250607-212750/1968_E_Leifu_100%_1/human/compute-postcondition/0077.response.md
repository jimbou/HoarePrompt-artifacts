To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in range(4, n + 1):`, so we can only adjust the states of `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5 and `n` is an integer greater than 5.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 6. Since `n` is already greater than 5, it remains the same.

The other variables, such as `t`, `i`, `stdin`, and the printed output, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 5, `j` is 6, stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' has been printed, '4 4' has been printed, and '5 5' has been printed**
