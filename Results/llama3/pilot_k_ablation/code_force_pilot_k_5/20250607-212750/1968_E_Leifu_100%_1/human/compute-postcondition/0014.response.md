The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 4, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is greater than 0, i is 0, n is an integer between 4 and 10^3 (inclusive) but not equal to 3, stdin contains a list of n integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, and '2 4' is printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 4 and j is now 4. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' is printed, j is 4**
