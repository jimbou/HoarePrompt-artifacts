Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n-1` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed. If `n` is 2, nothing else is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to be an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), and the stdin now contains a list of `n-1` integers. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The print statements that were previously printed remain the same, and no new print statements have been added.
