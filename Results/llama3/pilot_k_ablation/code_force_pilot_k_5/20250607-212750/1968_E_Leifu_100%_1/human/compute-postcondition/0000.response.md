Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: a list of t integers (n) where 2 <= n <= 10^3**.

In this output state, the value of `t` has been assigned the first input from stdin, which is a positive integer. The stdin now contains a list of `t` integers (n), where each `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^3.
