Output State: **`t` is 0, `i` is `t`, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed `t` times, '1 2' has been printed `t` times. If `n` is 3, '2 3' has been printed `t` times. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' has been printed `t` times, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` has been printed followed by a space and `j` has been printed `t` times.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the variables `t`, `i`, and `n` have reached their final values. The input stream `stdin` is empty, and the output stream contains the results of the loop's execution, which include the repeated printing of '1 1' and '1 2', and either '2 3' or '2 4' and the series of numbers from 4 to `n` in the format 'x x', depending on the value of `n`.
