Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' has been printed, and for all integers `j` from 4 to `n` (inclusive), `j` is printed followed by a space and `j` is printed, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and either '2 3' is printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' is printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations from 4 to `n` (inclusive), printing each number `j` followed by a space and itself. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, and the input stream `stdin` is still empty. The initial prints of '1 1', '1 2', and '1 2' are still present, as well as the print of '2 4'. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed, otherwise, '2 4' and `n` followed by a space and `n` are printed. Finally, '1 1', '1 2', and '2 4' are printed again.
