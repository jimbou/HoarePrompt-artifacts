The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 7, `n` is an integer between 8 and 10^3 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 8 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than or equal to 8.
State: **`t` is at least 4, `i` is 4, `n` is an integer between 8 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' has been printed, and '1 2' has been printed, and either '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is assigned the value `int(stdin.pop(0))` where `stdin.pop(0)` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer, and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed. If `n` is 3, '2 3' is printed. If `n` is greater than or equal to 4, '2 4' is printed, `j` is 8, and a series of numbers from 4 to `n` are printed in the format 'x x', and '1 1' is printed, and '1 2' is printed, and '2 4' is printed, and '4 4' is printed, and '5 5' is printed, and '6 6' is printed, and '7 7' is printed, and '7 7' is printed**
