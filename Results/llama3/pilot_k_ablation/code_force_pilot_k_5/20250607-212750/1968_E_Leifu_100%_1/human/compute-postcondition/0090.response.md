Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed and `n` is printed followed by a space and `n` is printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and '1 1' has been printed, and '1 2' has been printed, and either '2 3' has been printed if `n` is 3 or '2 4' has been printed if `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `n` is assigned the value `int(input())` where `input()` accepts an integer and `int` converts it to an integer.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still at least 3, the value of `i` is still 3, the value of `n` is now an integer between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive) that has been input by the user, the standard input is empty, and the same print statements have been executed as before. Additionally, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer input by the user.
