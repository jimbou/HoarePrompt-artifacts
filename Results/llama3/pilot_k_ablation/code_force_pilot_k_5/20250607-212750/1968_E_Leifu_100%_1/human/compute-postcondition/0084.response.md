Based on the precondition, we know that `j` is 8. The print statement is concatenating the string representation of `j` with a space and then again with the string representation of `j`.

So, when the print statement is executed, it will print the string representation of `j` (which is '8') followed by a space and then again the string representation of `j` (which is '8').

Output: **8 8**
