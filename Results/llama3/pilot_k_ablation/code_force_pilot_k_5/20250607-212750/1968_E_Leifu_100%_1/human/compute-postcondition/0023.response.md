To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(4, n + 1):`

The variables involved in the loop head are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. Since `j` is currently 6, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 7.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables `t`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 7 and 10^3 (inclusive), stdin contains a list of `n` integers, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' is printed, j is 7, and this is printed: '5 5', and this is printed: '6 6'**
