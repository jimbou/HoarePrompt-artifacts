To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 4 (since the range starts from 4). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, stdin is empty, '1 1' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '1 2' has been printed, '2 4' has been printed, `j` is 4**
