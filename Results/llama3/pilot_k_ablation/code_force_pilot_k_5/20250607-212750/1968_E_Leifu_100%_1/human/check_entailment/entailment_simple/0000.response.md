Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. For n = 2, it prints (1, 1) and (1, 2). For n = 3, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 3). For n >= 4, it prints (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4), and then for each j from 4 to n, it prints (j, j).

The program's logic is based on the observation that the maximum size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances is achieved when the cells are placed in a way that maximizes the number of distinct distances between them. The program's output for each test case is consistent with the examples provided in the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
