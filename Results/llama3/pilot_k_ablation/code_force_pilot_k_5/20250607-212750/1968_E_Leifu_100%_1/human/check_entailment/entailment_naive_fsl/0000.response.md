Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 6, the program outputs:

1 1
1 2
2 4
4 4
5 5
6 6

However, the correct output for n = 6 should be:

1 4
1 5
1 6
5 2
5 5
6 1

The program does not correctly maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells.
