Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first element in `arrC`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n`.***
