Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is 1, If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been updated to 1, and the value of `ans` is determined based on the value of `k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is equal to `n`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
