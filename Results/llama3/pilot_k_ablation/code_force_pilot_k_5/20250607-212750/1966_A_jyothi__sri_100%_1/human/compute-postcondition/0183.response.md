Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, a new key-value pair is added to the `hashmap` dictionary, where the key is the value of `i` (which is the fourth element in `arrC`) and the value is 1.
