Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 5 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, `i` is added to `hashmap` with a frequency of 1. If the frequency of `i` in `arrC` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.***
