Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is 1, i is the third element in arrC. If the value of the key i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of t, n, k, and arrC remain the same. The hashmap now has a key-value pair where the key is the third element in arrC (i) and its value is 1. The other key-value pairs in hashmap remain the same. The value of ans is still between 1 and 99 (inclusive) if the value of the key i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k.
