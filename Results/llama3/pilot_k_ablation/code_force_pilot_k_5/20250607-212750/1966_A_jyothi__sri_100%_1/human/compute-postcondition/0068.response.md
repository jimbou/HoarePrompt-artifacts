Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `k-1`, regardless of the previous conditions. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, and `i` remain unchanged.
