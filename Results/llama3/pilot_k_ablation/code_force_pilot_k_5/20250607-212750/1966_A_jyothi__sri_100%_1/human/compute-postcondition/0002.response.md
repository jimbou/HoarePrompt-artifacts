Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n.**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin contains t-1 test cases because two lines of input are consumed by the code for each test case. The values of n and k are updated based on the input from stdin. The list arrC is populated with n integers from the second line of each test case. The hashmap is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variable ans is assigned the value of n.
