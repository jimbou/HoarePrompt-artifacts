Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is either increased by 1 if `i` was already in `hashmap`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `hashmap`. `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`.**
