Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is the first element in the list, hashmap contains the key i with a value of 1, and i is not a key in hashmap is no longer true because i is now a key in hashmap.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of t, n, k, arrC, and ans remain the same. The hashmap now contains the key i with a value of 1, indicating that the frequency of i in arrC is 1. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases. The value of i is still the first element in the list. However, the condition that i is not a key in hashmap is no longer true because i is now a key in hashmap.
