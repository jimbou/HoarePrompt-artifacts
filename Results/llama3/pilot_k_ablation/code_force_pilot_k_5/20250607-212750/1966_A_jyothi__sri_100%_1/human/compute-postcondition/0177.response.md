Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, `hashmap` has a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. However, a new key-value pair is added to `hashmap` where the key is `i` and the value is 1. This means that `i` is now a key in `hashmap` with a value of 1. The value of `ans` is not affected by this code snippet, so it is not included in the output state.
