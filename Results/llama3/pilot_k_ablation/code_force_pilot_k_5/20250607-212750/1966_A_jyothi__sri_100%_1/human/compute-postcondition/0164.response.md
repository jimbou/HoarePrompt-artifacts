Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `i` is the first element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, `stdin` contains no input, and `i` is in `hashmap`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that `hashmap` now contains `i` as a key with a value of 1, and `i` is now in `hashmap`.
