Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1.***
