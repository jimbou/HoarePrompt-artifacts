Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 495 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `stdin` contains no input, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arrC` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `arrC`, `i` is the last element in `arrC`, and `ans` is either `n` or `k-1` (where `ans` is `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n`), and `ans` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `t` has decreased by 1, and all other variables remain unchanged. The range of `t` has shifted down by 1, but all other conditions and relationships between variables are still the same.
