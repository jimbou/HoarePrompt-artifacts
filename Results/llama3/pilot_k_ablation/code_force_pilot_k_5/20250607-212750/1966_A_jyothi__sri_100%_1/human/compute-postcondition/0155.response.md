Based on the precondition, the value of `ans` depends on the frequency of elements in the list `arrC`. If any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n`.

Since the exact frequencies of elements in `arrC` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ans`. However, we can describe the possible values of `ans` based on the given conditions.

Output: **k - 1 (if the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k), otherwise n**
