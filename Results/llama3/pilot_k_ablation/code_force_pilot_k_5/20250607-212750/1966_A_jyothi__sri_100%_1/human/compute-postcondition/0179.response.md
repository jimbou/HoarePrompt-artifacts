Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, `hashmap` contains key-value pairs where the key is `i` and the value is either incremented by 1 if `i` is already a key or 1 if `i` is not a key, `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The `hashmap` still contains key-value pairs based on the value of `i`. A new variable `ans` is introduced and assigned the value of `k - 1`, which is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).
