Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

The code snippet reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, and a list of integers `arrC` from the next line of input. It then initializes an empty dictionary `hashmap` and sets the variable `ans` to the value of `n`. The state of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The state of `stdin` is updated to reflect that one test case has been processed, leaving `t-1` test cases remaining.
