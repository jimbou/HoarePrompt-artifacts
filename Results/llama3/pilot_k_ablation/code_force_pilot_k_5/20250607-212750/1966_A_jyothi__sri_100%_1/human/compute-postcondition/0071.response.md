Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is increased by 1, If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the frequency of the fifth element `i` in the dictionary `hashmap` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` and the value of `k`. If the frequency of `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is `k-1`, otherwise, it is `n`.
