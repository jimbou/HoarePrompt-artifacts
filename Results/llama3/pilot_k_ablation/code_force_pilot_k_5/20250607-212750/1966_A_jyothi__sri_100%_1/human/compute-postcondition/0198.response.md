Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines: the first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. It then counts the frequency of each integer in the second line and determines the minimum value between n and k-1, where k-1 is only considered if any integer appears at least k times. The function prints this minimum value for each test case.**
