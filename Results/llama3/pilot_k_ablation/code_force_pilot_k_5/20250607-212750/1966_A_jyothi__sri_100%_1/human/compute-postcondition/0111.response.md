Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been reset to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of `hashmap[i]`, but since `hashmap[i]` is now 1, `ans` will be either `k-1` or `n`.
