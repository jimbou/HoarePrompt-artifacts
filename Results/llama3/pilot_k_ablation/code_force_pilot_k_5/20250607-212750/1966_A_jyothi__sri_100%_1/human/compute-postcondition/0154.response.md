Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least n key-value pairs where the key is each element in arrC and its value is the frequency of the key in arrC, i is the last element in arrC. If the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables t, n, and k remain unchanged within their respective ranges. The list arrC must have at least n elements. The hashmap contains key-value pairs where each key is an element from arrC and its value represents the frequency of that element in arrC. The variable i is set to the last element in arrC. If any element in arrC has a frequency greater than or equal to k, then ans is set to k - 1; otherwise, ans remains equal to n.
