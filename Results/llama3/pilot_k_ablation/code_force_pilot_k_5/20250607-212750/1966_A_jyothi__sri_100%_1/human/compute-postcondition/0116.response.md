The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined by the value of `hashmap[i]` and `k`. If the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to either `k-1` or `n`.

Since the exact values of `hashmap[i]`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `k-1` or `n`.

Output: **k-1 or n (where k-1 is k minus one and n is the value of n)**
