Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise, it remains an integer equal to `n`, and `i` is the next element in `arrC` but `hashmap[i]` is now 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the frequency of the current element `i` in the hashmap is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
