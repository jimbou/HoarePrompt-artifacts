Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 500, the number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-1`, the value of `n` is still between 1 and 100, the value of `k` is still between 2 and 100, the list `arrC` still contains `n` integers between 1 and 100 with at least 4 elements, the dictionary `hashmap` still contains the frequency of each integer in `arrC`, but the frequency of the fourth element `i` in `hashmap` has been incremented by 1. The value of `ans` is either `k-1` if the frequency of `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, or it remains `n` otherwise.
