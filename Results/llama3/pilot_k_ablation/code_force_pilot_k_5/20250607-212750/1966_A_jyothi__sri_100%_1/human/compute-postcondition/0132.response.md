Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least two key-value pairs where the key is the first element in `arrC` and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if the key does not exist in `hashmap`, and the second key is the second element in `arrC` with a value of 1, `i` is the second element in `arrC`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arrC` remain unchanged. The `hashmap` now contains an additional key-value pair where the key is the second element in `arrC` (i.e., `i`) and its value is set to 1. The value of `i` is still the second element in `arrC`.
