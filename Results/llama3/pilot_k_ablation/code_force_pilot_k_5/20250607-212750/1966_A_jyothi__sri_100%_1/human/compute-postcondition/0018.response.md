The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list arrC, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arrC.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arrC has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements. `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`. If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.
