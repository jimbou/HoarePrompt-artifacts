Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the key is the second element in `arrC` and the value is 1, `i` is the second element in `arrC`, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The only change is the addition of a new key-value pair to the `hashmap` dictionary, where the key is the second element in `arrC` (which is also the value of `i`) and the value is 1.
