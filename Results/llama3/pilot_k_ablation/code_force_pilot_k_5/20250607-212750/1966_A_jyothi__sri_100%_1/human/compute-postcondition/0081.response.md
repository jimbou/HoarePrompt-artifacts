Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `arrC`. The `hashmap` is initialized as an empty dictionary, and the value of `ans` is set to `n`. The code does not update the frequency of elements in `hashmap` or check the condition for updating `ans` based on the frequency of elements in `hashmap`. Therefore, the final state of the variables remains the same as their initial state, with the exception of `hashmap` being empty and `ans` being set to `n`.
