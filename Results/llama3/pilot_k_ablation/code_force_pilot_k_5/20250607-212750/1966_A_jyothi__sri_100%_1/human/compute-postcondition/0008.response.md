Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, then the value associated with `i` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added to `hashmap` with a value of 1. In both cases, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`, and `i` is the first element in the list.***
