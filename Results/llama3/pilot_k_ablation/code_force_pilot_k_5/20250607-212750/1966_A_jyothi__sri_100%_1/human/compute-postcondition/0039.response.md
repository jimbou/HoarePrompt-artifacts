The code prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `n`. Where `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `arrC` is an empty list.
Output: ** `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is an empty list, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, and the value of ans is being printed**
