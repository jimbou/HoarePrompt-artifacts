Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `hashmap` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1.***
