Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is now 1, and `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been reset to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still equal to `n` because the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is now 1, which is less than `k`.
