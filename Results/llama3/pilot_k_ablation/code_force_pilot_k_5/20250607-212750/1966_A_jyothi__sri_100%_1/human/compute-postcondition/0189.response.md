Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is 1, `ans` is not set to `k-1` because `hashmap[i]` is not greater than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that `hashmap[i]` is now set to 1, regardless of its previous value. Additionally, since `hashmap[i]` is not greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `ans` is not set to `k-1`.
