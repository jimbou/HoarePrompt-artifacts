The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to k-1 if the frequency of any element i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed.**
