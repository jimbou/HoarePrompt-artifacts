Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in `arrC` and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if the key does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is 1, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive) if the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` is set to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is determined based on the value of `hashmap[i]` and `k`. If `hashmap[i]` is less than `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.
