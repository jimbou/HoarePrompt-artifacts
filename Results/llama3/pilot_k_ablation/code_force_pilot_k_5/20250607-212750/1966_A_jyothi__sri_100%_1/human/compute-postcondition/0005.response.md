Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i` and its value is incremented by 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, and the current value of `i` is a key in `hashmap`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `hashmap` still contains at least one key-value pair with the key `i`, but its value has been increased by 1.
