The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least n key-value pairs where the key is each element in arrC and its value is the frequency of the key in arrC, i is the last element in arrC. If the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to n, and ans is printed, where ans is either k-1 or n depending on whether the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k or not**
