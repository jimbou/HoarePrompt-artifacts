Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least n key-value pairs where the key is each element in arrC and its value is the frequency of the key in arrC, i is the last element in arrC. If the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to n, and ans is printed, where ans is either k-1 or n depending on whether the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k or not**
