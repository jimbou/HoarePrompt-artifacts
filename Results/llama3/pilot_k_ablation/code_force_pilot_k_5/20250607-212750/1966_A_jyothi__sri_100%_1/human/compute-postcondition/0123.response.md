Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is incremented by 1, i is the first element in arrC and is also a key in hashmap, ans is an integer equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of t, n, k, arrC, and ans remain unchanged. The hashmap's value for the key 'i' (which is the first element in arrC) is incremented by 1.
