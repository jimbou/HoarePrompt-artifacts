Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary where if `i` is a key, its value is either incremented by 1 or is 1. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is not set to `k-1`.***
