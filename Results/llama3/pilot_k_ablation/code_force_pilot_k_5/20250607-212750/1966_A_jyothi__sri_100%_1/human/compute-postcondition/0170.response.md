Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` (which is the second element in `arrC`) is incremented by 1, `i` is the second element in `arrC`, `stdin` contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values and ranges, except for the `hashmap` dictionary, where the value associated with the key `i` (which is the second element in the list `arrC`) is incremented by 1. The input stream remains empty.
