The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined by the frequency of elements in the list `arrC` and the value of `k`.

If the frequency of any element `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n`.

Since the exact values of `arrC`, `hashmap`, `k`, and `n` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `k-1` or `n`.

Output: **k-1 (if the frequency of any element i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k), otherwise n**
