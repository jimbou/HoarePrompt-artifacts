Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, and `i` is the first element in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap` has been updated to include the key-value pair `{i: 1}`, where `i` is the first element in the list `arrC`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `hashmap` now contains one key-value pair, and `i` is no longer not in `hashmap`.
