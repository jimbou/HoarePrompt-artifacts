Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` is increased by 1, `i` is the second element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been increased by 1, and the value of `ans` is determined based on the new value of `hashmap[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged.
