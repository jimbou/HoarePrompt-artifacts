Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `n` if the frequency of the second element `i` in `hashmap` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`, `i` is the second element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, it is added with a frequency of 1.**
