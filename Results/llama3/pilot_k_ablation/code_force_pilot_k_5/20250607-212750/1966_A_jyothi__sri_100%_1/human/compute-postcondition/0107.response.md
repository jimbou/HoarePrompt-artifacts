Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is either increased by 1 if `i` was already in `hashmap`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `hashmap`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is always `k-1`, regardless of the previous conditions. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
