Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains no input, `ans` is `k-1`, `i` is the first element in `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `k-1`, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `stdin`, `i`, and `hashmap[i]` are still valid.
