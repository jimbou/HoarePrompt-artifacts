The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arrC`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arrC`.  If the list has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, `arrC` has at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `hashmap` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k-1`.**
