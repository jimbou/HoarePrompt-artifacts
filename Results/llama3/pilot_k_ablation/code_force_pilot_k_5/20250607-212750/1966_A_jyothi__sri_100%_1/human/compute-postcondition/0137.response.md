Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is either incremented by 1 if i already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if i does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is either incremented by 1 if i already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if i does not exist in hashmap, i is the third element in arrC, and the value of the key i in hashmap is incremented by 1. If the value of the key i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of t, n, k, and arrC remain unchanged. The hashmap dictionary still contains at least one key-value pair, and the value of the key i (which is the third element in arrC) is incremented by 1. If the incremented value of the key i is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).
