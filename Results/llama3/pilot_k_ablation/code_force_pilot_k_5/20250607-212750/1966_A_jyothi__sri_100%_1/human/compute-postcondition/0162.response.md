Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is `i`, `i` is the first element in `arrC`, the value of `hashmap[i]` is increased by 1, `ans` is `n`, and `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` is increased by 1, where `i` is the first element in `arrC`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The dictionary `hashmap` still contains at least one key-value pair, and the key is still `i`, which is the first element in `arrC`. The value of `ans` is still `n`, and there is no input in `stdin`.
