Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, and `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arrC` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still the fourth element in `arrC`. However, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been incremented by 1.
