Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary where the value of each key is the number of times the key appears in arrC, i is the last element in arrC. If the value of hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k-1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to either k-1 or n, and ans is printed**
