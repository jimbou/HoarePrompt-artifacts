Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least two key-value pairs where the key is the first element in `arrC` and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if the key does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is 1, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` is set to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is still between 1 and 99 (inclusive), as the condition for `ans` to be `k - 1` is not met since `hashmap[i]` is now 1, which is less than `k`.
