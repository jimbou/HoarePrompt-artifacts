Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    arrC = list(map(int, input().split()))
    hashmap = {}
    ans = n
    for i in arrC:
        if i in hashmap:
            hashmap[i] += 1
        else:
            hashmap[i] = 1
        if hashmap[i] >= k:
            ans = k - 1
    print(ans)
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is an empty list, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, and the value of ans is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to k-1 if the frequency of any element i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of each key is the number of times the key appears in `arrC`, `i` is the last element in `arrC`. If the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`, and `ans` is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer between 0 and 496 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least n key-value pairs where the key is each element in arrC and its value is the frequency of the key in arrC, i is the last element in arrC. If the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to n, and ans is printed, where ans is either k-1 or n depending on whether the frequency of any element in arrC is greater than or equal to k or not
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 495 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `stdin` contains no input, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arrC` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `arrC`, `i` is the last element in `arrC`, and `ans` is either `n` or `k-1` (where `ans` is `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is `n`), and `ans` is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
