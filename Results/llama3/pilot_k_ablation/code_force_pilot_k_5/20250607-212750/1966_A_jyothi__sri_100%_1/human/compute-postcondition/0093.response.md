Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element in `arrC` and the value is 1, `i` is the second element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`**.

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` is now 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now equal to `n` because the value of `hashmap[i]` is 1, which is less than `k`.
