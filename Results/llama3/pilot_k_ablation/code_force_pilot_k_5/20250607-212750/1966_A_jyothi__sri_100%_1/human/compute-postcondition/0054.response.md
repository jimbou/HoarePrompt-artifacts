Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, except for the second element `i` in `arrC` which has a frequency of 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `n` if the frequency of the second element `i` in `hashmap` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`, `i` is the second element in `arrC`**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arrC` remain the same. The `hashmap` dictionary is updated such that the frequency of the second element `i` in `arrC` is now 1. The value of `ans` depends on the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` and the value of `k`. If the frequency of `i` is less than `k`, then `ans` is equal to `n`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`. The value of `i` remains the same as the second element in `arrC`.
