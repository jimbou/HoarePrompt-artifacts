Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary that contains the first element of arrC as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element of arrC is already in hashmap, otherwise hashmap is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and the value is 1, i is the first element in arrC. If the value of hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k-1 and the value of ans is being printed. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged and is equal to n.***
