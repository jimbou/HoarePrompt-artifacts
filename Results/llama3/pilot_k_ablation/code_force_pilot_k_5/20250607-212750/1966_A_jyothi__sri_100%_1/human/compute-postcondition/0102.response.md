Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`. `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1 if `i` was not already in `hashmap`, otherwise the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1.***
