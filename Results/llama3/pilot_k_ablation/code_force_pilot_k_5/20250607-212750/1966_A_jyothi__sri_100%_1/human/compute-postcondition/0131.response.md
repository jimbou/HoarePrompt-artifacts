Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is incremented by 1, i is the second element in arrC**

In this output state, the value of the key i in hashmap is incremented by 1. This means that if the key i already existed in hashmap, its value is now one more than its previous value. If the key i did not exist in hashmap, its value is now 1. The values of the other variables, t, n, k, arrC, and the rest of the key-value pairs in hashmap, remain unchanged.
