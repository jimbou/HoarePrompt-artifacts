Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements. `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`. `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `k-1`, which is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive) since `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
