Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is increased by 1, if the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arrC` remain the same. The value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1. If the new value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to either `k-1` or `n`.
