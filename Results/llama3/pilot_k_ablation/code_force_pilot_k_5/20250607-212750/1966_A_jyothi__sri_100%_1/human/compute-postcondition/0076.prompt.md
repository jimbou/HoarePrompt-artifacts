Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to n if the frequency of the first element i in hashmap is less than k, otherwise ans is an integer equal to k-1

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the second element in `arrC`. If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the third element in `arrC`. If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`. If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
