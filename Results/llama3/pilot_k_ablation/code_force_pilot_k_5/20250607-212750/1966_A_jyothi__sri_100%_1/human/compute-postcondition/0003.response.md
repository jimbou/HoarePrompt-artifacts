The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arrC`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arrC`. If `arrC` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `hashmap` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`. So for the loop to be executed `arrC` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, `i` is the first element in the list**
