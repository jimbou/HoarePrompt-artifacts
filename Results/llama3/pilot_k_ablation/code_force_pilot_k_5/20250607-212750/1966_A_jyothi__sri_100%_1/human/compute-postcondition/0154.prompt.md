Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is an empty dictionary, i is not defined, ans is an integer equal to n.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, i is the first element in arrC and is also a key in hashmap. If the value of hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ans remains an integer equal to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is either incremented by 1 if i already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if i does not exist in hashmap, i is the second element in arrC. If the value of the key i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is either incremented by 1 if i already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if i does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is either incremented by 1 if i already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if i does not exist in hashmap, i is the third element in arrC. If i is already in hashmap, the value of the key i in hashmap is incremented by 1. If i is not in hashmap, the value of the key i in hashmap is set to 1. If the value of the key i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ans is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in `arrC` and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if the key does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is either incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `hashmap`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is set to 1. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least two key-value pairs where the key is the first element in `arrC` and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if the key does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is either incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `hashmap`, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is set to 1. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
