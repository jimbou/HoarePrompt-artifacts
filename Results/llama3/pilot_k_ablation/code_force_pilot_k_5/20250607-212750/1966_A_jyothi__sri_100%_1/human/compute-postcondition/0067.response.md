Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1. If the new frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, `hashmap[i]` is set to 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.***
