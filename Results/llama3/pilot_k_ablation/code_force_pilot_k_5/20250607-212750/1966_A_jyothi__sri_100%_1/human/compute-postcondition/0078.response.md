The code prints the value of `ans`, which is an integer equal to `k-1` if the frequency of any element `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `n`. Where `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`.
Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to k-1 if the frequency of any element i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed**
