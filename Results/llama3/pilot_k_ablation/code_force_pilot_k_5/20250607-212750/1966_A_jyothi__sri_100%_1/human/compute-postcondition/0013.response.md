Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements. `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC` incremented by 1 for the key `i`. If the frequency of the first element `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the frequency of the key `i` in the `hashmap` dictionary has been incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
