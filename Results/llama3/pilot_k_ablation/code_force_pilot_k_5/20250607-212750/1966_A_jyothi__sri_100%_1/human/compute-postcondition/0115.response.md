Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary where the value of each key is the number of times the key appears in arrC, i is the last element in arrC. If the value of hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k-1. Otherwise, ans is an integer equal to either k-1 or n.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. `arrC` is a list of integers with at least `n` elements. `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an element from `arrC` and its corresponding value is the number of times that element appears in `arrC`. `i` is the last element in `arrC`. The value of `ans` depends on the value of `hashmap[i]`: if it is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k-1`; otherwise, `ans` is either `k-1` or `n`.
