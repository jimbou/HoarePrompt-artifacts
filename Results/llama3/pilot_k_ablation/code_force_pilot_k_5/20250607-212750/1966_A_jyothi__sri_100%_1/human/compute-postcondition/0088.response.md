Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary that contains the first element of arrC as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element of arrC is already in hashmap, otherwise hashmap is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and the value is 1, ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed, i is the first element in arrC. The current value of hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k***
