Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` is 1, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been updated to 1, where `i` is the third element in `arrC`. The other variables remain unchanged.
