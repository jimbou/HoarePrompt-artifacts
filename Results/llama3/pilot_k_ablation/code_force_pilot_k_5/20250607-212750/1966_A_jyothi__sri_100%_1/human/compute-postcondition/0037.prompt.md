Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of n integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element. `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`. If the frequency of the first element `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements. `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`. If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and `i` is the next element in `arrC`. The frequency of `i` in `hashmap` has been incremented by 1 if `i` is already in `hashmap`, otherwise, `hashmap[i]` is now 1. If the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`, otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. If the frequency of `i` in `arrC` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 5 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, `i` is added to `hashmap` with a frequency of 1. If the frequency of `i` in `arrC` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
