Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and the value is 1, ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed, i is the first element in arrC.**

In this output state, the code has added a new key-value pair to the hashmap dictionary, where the key is the first element in the arrC list (which is also the value of i) and the value is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of ans is still being printed, and its value is still equal to n.
