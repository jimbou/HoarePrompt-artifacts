Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is the frequency of `i` in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is now `k-1`, regardless of the previous value of `hashmap[i]`. The values of `t`, `stdin`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, and `i` remain unchanged.
