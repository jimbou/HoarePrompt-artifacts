Postcondition: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is the first element in the list. If i is already a key in hashmap, then the frequency of i in hashmap is increased by 1. If i is not a key in hashmap, then i is added to hashmap with a frequency of 1.**
