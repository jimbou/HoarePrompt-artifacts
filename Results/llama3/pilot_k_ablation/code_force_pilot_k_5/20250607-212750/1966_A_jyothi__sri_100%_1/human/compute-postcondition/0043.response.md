The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arrC`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arrC`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 element and the i is the first element in the list.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is the first element in the list**
