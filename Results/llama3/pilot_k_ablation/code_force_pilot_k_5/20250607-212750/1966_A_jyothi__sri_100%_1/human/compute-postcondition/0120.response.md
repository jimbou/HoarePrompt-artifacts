Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is an empty dictionary, i is not defined, ans is an integer equal to n.**

The code snippet provided does not modify the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `arrC`. The `hashmap` is reinitialized as an empty dictionary, and the value of `ans` is set to `n`. The variable `i` is not defined in the output state because its value is not explicitly set in the provided code snippet.
