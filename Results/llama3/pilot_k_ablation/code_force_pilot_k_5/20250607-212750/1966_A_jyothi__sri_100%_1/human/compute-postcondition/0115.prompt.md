Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is an empty dictionary, ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary that contains the first element of arrC as a key and its value is increased by 1 if the first element of arrC is already in hashmap, otherwise hashmap is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and the value is 1, i is the first element in arrC. If the value of hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer equal to k-1 and the value of ans is being printed. Otherwise, the value of ans remains unchanged and is equal to n.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` is increased by 1 if `i` is already in `hashmap`, otherwise `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the second element in `arrC` and the value is 1, `i` is the second element in `arrC`. If the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`. `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1 if `i` was not already in `hashmap`, otherwise the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is either increased by 1 if `i` was already in `hashmap`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `hashmap`. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is either increased by 1 if `i` was already in `hashmap`, or set to 1 if `i` was not in `hashmap`. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
