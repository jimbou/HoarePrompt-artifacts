Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in `arrC` and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if the key does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is either incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is either incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `hashmap`, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is set to 1. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` has been incremented by 1. If `i` was not in `hashmap` before, it has been added with a value of 1. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` and `k`.
