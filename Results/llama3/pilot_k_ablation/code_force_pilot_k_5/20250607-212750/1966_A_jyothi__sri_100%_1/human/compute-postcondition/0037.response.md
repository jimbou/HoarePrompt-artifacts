Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is an empty list, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: the number of test cases `t` remains unchanged, the number of test cases in `stdin` remains unchanged, the size of the list `arrC` is unchanged, the value of `k` is unchanged, the list `arrC` is empty because all its elements have been processed, the dictionary `hashmap` contains the frequency of each element in `arrC`, and the value of `ans` is either `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, or `n` if no element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`.
