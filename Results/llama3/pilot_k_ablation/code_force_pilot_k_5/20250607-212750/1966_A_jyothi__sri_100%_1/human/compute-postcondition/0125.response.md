The code `hashmap[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `hashmap`. Since `i` is the first element in `arrC` and is not in `hashmap` initially, this operation adds a new key-value pair to `hashmap`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is the first element of `arrC` and the value is 1, `i` is the first element in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.**
