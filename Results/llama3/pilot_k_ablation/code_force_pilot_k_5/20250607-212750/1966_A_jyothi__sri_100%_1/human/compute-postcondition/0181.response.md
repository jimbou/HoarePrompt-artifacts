The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list arrC, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arrC.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, arrC has at least 3 elements, i is the third element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the i is the fourth element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`.**
