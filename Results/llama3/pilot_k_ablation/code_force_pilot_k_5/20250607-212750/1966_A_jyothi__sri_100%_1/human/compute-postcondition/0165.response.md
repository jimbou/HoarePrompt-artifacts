Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains no input, `ans` is `n`, and `i` is the first element in `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, the value of `hashmap[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `hashmap` is updated with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, and `i` is added to `hashmap`.***
