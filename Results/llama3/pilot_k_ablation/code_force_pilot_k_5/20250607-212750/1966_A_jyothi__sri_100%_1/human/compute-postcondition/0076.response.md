Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to k-1 if the frequency of any element i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is an integer equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variables t, n, and k remain unchanged within their respective ranges. The list arrC must have at least n elements, and the dictionary hashmap accurately reflects the frequency of each integer in arrC. The variable ans is set to k-1 if any element in hashmap has a frequency greater than or equal to k; otherwise, ans remains equal to n.
