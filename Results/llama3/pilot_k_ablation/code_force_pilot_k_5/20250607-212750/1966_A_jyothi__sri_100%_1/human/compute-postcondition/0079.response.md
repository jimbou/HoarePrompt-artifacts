Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, ans is an integer equal to k-1 if the frequency of any element i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of t has been decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 498 (inclusive). The values of n, k, arrC, hashmap, and ans remain the same as in the initial state. The value of ans is still being printed.
