The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the frequency of elements in the list `arrC` and the value of `k`.

Since `arrC` is an empty list, no elements have been added to it, and therefore, no frequencies have been calculated. As a result, the condition for `ans` to be `k-1` (i.e., any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`) is not met.

Hence, the value of `ans` will be `n`, which is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

Output: **n (where n is an integer between 1 and 100)**
