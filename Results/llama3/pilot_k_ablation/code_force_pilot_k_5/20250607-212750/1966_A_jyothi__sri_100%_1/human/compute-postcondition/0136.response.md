The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list arrC, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arrC.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arrC has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is either incremented by 1 if i already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if i does not exist in hashmap, and the value of the key i in hashmap is either incremented by 1 if i already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if i does not exist in hashmap, i is the third element in arrC. If the value of the key i in hashmap is greater than or equal to k, then ans is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).**
