Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary where if `i` is a key, its value is either incremented by 1 or is 1, `ans` is set to `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The `hashmap` remains unchanged as well, but its state is still dependent on the value of `i`. The only change is that `ans` is now set to `k-1`, regardless of the previous conditions.
