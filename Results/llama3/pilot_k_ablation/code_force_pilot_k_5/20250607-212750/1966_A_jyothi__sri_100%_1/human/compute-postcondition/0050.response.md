Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is the first element in the list, and the current value of `i` is a key in `hashmap` and the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is at least `k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `hashmap`, `stdin`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `ans` has been updated to `k-1`, which is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).
