Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1 if `i` was not already in `hashmap`, otherwise the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to `k-1`. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, `i`, and `hashmap` remain unchanged. The value of `hashmap` still depends on whether `i` was already a key in `hashmap` or not.
