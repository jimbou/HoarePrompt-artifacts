Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of the key `i` is incremented by 1, if the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arrC` remain the same. The value of the key `i` in the `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).
