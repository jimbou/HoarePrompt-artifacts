Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least n elements, hashmap is an empty dictionary, i is not defined, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains no input
Code of the loop:
for i in arrC:
    if i in hashmap:
        hashmap[i] += 1
    else:
        hashmap[i] = 1
    if hashmap[i] >= k:
        ans = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first element in `arrC`. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in `hashmap`, a new key-value pair is added to `hashmap` where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in `hashmap`, a new key-value pair is added to `hashmap` where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, no specific value is assigned to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, then `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `hashmap` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary where if `i` is a key, its value is either incremented by 1 or is 1. If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is not set to `k-1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
