Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of `n` integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements. `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and the frequency of the first element `i` in `hashmap` is now 1. If the frequency of the first element `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC` and `stdin` remains the same. The value of `hashmap` is updated such that the frequency of the first element `i` is now 1. The value of `ans` depends on the frequency of the first element `i` in `hashmap`. If the frequency of the first element `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). Otherwise, `ans` remains an integer equal to `n`.
