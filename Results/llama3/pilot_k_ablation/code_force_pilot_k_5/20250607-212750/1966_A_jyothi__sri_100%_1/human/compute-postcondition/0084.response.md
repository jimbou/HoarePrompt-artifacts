Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary that contains the first element of arrC as a key and its value is increased by 1, ans is an integer equal to n, and the value of ans is being printed, i is the first element in arrC and it is also a key in hashmap.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of t, n, k, arrC, and ans remain unchanged. The hashmap's value for the key i (which is the first element in arrC) is incremented by 1. The value of ans is still being printed.
