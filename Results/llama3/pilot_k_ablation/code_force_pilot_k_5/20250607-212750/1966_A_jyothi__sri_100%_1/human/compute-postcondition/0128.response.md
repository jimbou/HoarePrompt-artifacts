Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in arrC and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in hashmap or set to 1 if the key does not exist in hashmap, i is the first element in arrC and is also a key in hashmap, ans is an integer equal to k - 1. The current value of hashmap[i] is greater than or equal to k.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of t, n, k, arrC, hashmap, and i remain unchanged. The value of ans is updated to k - 1, which is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). The hashmap still contains at least one key-value pair, and the value of hashmap[i] is still greater than or equal to k.
