The value of hashmap[i] is incremented by 1. The value of hashmap[i] is the frequency of i in arrC. Therefore, the frequency of i in arrC is increased by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Since stdin contains t-1 test cases, it still contains t-1 test cases. The current value of i is still a key in hashmap. 

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), n is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), arrC is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, hashmap is a dictionary where each key is an integer from arrC and its value is the frequency of that integer in arrC, hashmap[i] is increased by 1, ans is an integer equal to n, stdin contains t-1 test cases, i is the first element in the list, and the current value of i is a key in hashmap.**
