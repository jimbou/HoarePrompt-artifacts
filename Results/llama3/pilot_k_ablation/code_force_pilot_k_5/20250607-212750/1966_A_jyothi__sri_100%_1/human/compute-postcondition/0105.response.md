Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 498 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `arrC`, `hashmap` is a dictionary with one key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain unchanged. The `hashmap` now has a key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is 1, indicating that `i` was not already in `hashmap` before the code was executed. As a result, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`, since the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is now 1, which is less than `k`.
