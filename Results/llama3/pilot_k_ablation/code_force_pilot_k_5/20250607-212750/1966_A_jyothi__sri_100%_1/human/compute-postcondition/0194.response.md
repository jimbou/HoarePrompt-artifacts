The code prints the value of `ans`, which is either `n` or `k-1`. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `k-1` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). 

The value of `ans` depends on the frequency of elements in `arrC`. If any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n`.

Since the exact frequencies of elements in `arrC` are not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either `n` or `k-1`.

Output: **n or k-1 (where n is an integer between 1 and 100 and k-1 is an integer between 1 and 99)**
