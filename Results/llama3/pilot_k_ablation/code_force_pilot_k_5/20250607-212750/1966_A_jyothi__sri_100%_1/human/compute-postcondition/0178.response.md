Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `arrC`. If `i` is already a key in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not a key in `hashmap`, a new key-value pair is added to `hashmap` where the key is `i` and the value is 1. If the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).***
