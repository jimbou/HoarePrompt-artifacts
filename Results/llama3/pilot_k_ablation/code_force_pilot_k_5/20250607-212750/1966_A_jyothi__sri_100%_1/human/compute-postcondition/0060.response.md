Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is 1, If `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.**

In this output state, the value of `hashmap[i]` has been updated to 1, and the other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `ans` is still dependent on the value of `hashmap[i]` and `k`.
