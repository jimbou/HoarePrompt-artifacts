Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary that contains at least one key-value pair where the key is the first element in `arrC` and its value is either incremented by 1 if the key already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if the key does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is either incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `hashmap`, and the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is either incremented by 1 if `i` already exists in `hashmap` or set to 1 if `i` does not exist in `hashmap`, `i` is the third element in `arrC`. If `i` is already in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `hashmap`, the value of the key `i` in `hashmap` is set to 1. `ans` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `hashmap` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is now set to `k - 1`, which is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive).
