The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is an empty list, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `n`**
