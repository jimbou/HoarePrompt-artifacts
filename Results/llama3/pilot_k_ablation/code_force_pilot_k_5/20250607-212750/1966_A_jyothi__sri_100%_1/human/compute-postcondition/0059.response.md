Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `i` is the third element in `arrC`, and the frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is increased by 1. If the new frequency of `i` in `hashmap` is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to `n`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `arrC`, and `i` remain the same as before. The frequency of `i` in the `hashmap` is incremented by 1. The value of `ans` depends on the new frequency of `i` in `hashmap`. If the new frequency is greater than or equal to `k`, `ans` is set to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is set to `n`.
