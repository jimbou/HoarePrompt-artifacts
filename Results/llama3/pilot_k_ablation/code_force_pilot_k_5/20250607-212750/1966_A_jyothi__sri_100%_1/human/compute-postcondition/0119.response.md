The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 497 (inclusive), So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 497 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where the value of each key is the number of times the key appears in `arrC`, `i` is the last element in `arrC`. If the value of `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is an integer equal to either `k-1` or `n`, and `ans` is printed.**
