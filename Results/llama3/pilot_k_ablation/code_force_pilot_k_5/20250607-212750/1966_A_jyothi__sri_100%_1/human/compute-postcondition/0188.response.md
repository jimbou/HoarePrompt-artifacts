Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `arrC`, `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, if `hashmap[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `arrC` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `hashmap[i]` is incremented by 1, and if this value is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is set to `k-1`. The value of `i` is still the fifth element in `arrC`.
