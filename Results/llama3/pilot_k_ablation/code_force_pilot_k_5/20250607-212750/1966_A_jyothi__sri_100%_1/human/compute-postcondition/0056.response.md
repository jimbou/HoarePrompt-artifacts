Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 499 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1`, `i` is the second element in `arrC`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is now `k-1`, while the values of other variables remain unchanged. The value of `t` is still between 1 and 499, `n` is still between 1 and 100, `k` is still between 2 and 100, `arrC` is still a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `hashmap` is still a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and `i` is still the second element in `arrC`.
