Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `stdin` contains no input, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an element in `arrC` and its corresponding value is the frequency of that element in `arrC`, `i` is the last element in `arrC`, `ans` is either `n` or `k-1`. If any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same initial state for variables `t`, `n`, `k`, and `stdin`. The list `arrC` will still have at least `n` elements. The dictionary `hashmap` will contain each unique element from `arrC` as keys and their respective frequencies as values. The variable `i` will be the last element processed in `arrC`. The variable `ans` will be either `n` or `k-1`, depending on whether any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`. If such an element exists, `ans` will be `k-1`; otherwise, it will remain as `n`.
