Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 496 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `arrC`, `hashmap` has a key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is either 1 or greater than 1, `ans` is an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive), `stdin` contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is calculated as `k - 1`, where `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). Therefore, the value of `ans` is also an integer between 1 and 99 (inclusive). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
