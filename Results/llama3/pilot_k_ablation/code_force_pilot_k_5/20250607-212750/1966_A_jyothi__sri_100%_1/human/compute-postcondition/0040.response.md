Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 499 (inclusive), `stdin` contains `t` test cases, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `k` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `arrC` is an empty list, `hashmap` is a dictionary where each key is an integer from `arrC` and its value is the frequency of that integer in `arrC`, and `ans` is an integer equal to `k-1` if any element in `arrC` has a frequency greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is an integer equal to `n`, and the value of ans is being printed.**

The value of `t` is decremented by 1, so it is now between 0 and 499 (inclusive). The number of test cases in `stdin` is also decremented by 1, so it now contains `t` test cases. The values of the other variables are not affected.
