The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3) and `t` is still greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0**
