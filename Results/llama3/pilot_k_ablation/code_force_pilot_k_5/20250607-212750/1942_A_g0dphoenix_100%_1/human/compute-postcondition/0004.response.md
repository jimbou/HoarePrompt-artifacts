Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0. The current value of `n` is equal to the current value of `k`. A string of '1 ' repeated n times (where n is equal to k) is being printed**
