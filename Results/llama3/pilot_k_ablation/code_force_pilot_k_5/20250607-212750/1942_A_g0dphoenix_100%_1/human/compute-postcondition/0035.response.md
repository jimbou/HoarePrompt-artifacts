Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values read from the input, which are integers between 1 and 10^3, and `k` is between 1 and `n`. The stdin now contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k, and t is still greater than 0.
