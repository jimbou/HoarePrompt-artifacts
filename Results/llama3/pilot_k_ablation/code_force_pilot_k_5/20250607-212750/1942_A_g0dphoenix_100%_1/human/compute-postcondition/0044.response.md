The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `t` must be greater than 0 and must be decreased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-6 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is being printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.**
