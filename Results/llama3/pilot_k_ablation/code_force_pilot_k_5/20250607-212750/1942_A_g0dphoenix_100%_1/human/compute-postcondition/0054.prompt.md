Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by t lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if n == k:
        print(('1 ' * n)[:-1])
    elif k == 1:
        print(' '.join([str(x + 1) for x in range(n)]))
    else:
        print(-1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0. If `n` is equal to `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (where n is equal to k) is being printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces is being printed. If `k` is not 1, -1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is being printed. Otherwise, if `k` is 1, the numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) are being printed, separated by spaces. Otherwise, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 1. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, "1 2 3 ... n" is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is being printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-7 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is being printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of integers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces is printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
