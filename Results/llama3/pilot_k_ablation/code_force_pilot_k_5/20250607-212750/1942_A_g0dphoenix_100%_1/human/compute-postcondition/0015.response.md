Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` have been updated to the values read from the first line of the input. The stdin now contains one less line, as the first line has been read and processed. The range of values for `n` and `k` remains the same, and the value of `t` is still greater than 0, indicating that there are still lines left to be processed in the input.
