The code accepts two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3 and `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, the new values of `n` and `k` are also within these ranges. The stdin now contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 1.**
