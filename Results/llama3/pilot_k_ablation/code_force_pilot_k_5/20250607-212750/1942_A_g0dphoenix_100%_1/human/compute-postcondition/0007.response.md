The code prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3. Since the current value of `k` is 1, it does not affect the output of the print statement. The output will be a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and ending at `n`, separated by spaces.

Output: **1 2 3 ... n (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^3)**
