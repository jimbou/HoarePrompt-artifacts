The code reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`. The input contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^3) followed by `t` lines, each containing two integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3). Since `t` is greater than 0, at least one line of input is consumed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-1 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0.**
