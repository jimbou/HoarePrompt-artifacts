Let's break down the code step by step:

1. `('1 ' * n)`: This expression creates a string by repeating the string `'1 '` `n` times. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, this will create a string with `n` occurrences of `'1 '`.
2. `[:-1]`: This slice notation removes the last character from the string. Since the string is composed of `'1 '` repeated `n` times, the last character is a space. By removing this space, the resulting string will have `n` occurrences of `'1'` without any trailing spaces.

Now, let's consider the initial state:

* `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3.
* `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`.
* `n` is equal to `k`.

Since `n` is equal to `k`, we can substitute `k` with `n` in the code. Therefore, the code is equivalent to:

`print(('1 ' * k)[:-1])`

Since `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, and `n` is equal to `k`, we can conclude that `k` is equal to `n`.

Now, let's analyze the output:

The code prints a string composed of `k` occurrences of `'1'` without any trailing spaces. Since `k` is equal to `n`, the output will have `n` occurrences of `'1'`.

Output: **n occurrences of '1' (where n is the current value of n, which is equal to k)**
