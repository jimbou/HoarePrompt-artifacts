The code prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3.
Output: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-3 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 1, and this is printed: "1 2 3 ... n"**
