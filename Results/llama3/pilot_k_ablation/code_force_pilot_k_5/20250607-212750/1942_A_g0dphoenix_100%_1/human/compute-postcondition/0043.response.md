Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^3, `k` is an integer between 1 and `n`, stdin contains t-5 lines, each containing two integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and t is still greater than 0. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) is being printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces is being printed. Otherwise, -1 is being printed.***
