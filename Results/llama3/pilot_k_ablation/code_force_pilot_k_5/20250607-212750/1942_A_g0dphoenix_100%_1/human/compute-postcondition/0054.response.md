Output State: **No more input lines are left in stdin, and the loop has finished executing. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) has been printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces has been printed. Otherwise, -1 has been printed.**

In natural language, this means that the loop has finished executing all its iterations, and there are no more input lines left in stdin. The output state depends on the values of `n` and `k` in the last iteration of the loop. If `n` equals `k`, a string of '1 ' repeated n times (excluding the last space) has been printed. If `n` is not equal to `k`, then if `k` is 1, a string of numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) separated by spaces has been printed. Otherwise, -1 has been printed.
