This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers n and k. For each test case, it prints a specific output based on the values of n and k. If n equals k, it prints a string of '1 ' repeated n times. If n is not equal to k but k is 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to n separated by spaces. For all other cases, it prints -1. The function continues to read and process test cases until all input lines have been consumed.
