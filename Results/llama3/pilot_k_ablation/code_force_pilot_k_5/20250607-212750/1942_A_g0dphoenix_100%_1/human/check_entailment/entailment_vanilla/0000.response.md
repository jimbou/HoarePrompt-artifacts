Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program consists of a single function `func()` that reads the input and produces the output.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case using a `for` loop.
2. For each test case, the program reads two integers `n` and `k` representing the length of the array and the number of sorted cyclic shifts, respectively.
3. The program checks if `n` is equal to `k`. If true, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program prints an array of `n` ones, which satisfies the condition.
4. If `n` is not equal to `k`, the program checks if `k` is equal to 1. If true, it means that only one cyclic shift of the array must be sorted. In this case, the program prints an array of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition.
5. If neither of the above conditions is true, the program prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. However, there is a small issue with the program's output format. In the second case, where `k` is equal to 1, the program prints an array of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`. However, the problem statement requires the output to be a single line of `n` integers, separated by spaces. The program's current output format is correct, but it could be improved for better readability.

Correctness: **True**
