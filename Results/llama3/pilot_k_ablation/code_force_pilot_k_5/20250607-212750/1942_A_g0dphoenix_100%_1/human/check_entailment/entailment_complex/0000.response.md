Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the three cases described in the problem statement:

1.  If `n` equals `k`, it prints a string of '1 ' repeated `n` times, which represents an array where all elements are equal, and thus all cyclic shifts are sorted.
2.  If `k` is 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n` separated by spaces, which represents an array where only one cyclic shift is sorted (the one where the smallest element is at the beginning).
3.  For all other cases, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required behavior based on the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
