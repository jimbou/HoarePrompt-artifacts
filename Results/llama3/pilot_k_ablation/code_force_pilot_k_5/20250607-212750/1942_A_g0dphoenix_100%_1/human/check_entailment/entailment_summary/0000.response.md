Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program handles three cases:

1.  When `n` equals `k`, it prints a string of `n` ones, which represents an array where all elements are equal. This array has `n` sorted cyclic shifts because all elements are the same, and therefore, any cyclic shift will result in the same sorted array.

2.  When `k` equals 1, it prints a string of numbers from 1 to `n`, which represents an array where each element is one more than the previous element. This array has exactly one sorted cyclic shift, which is the original array itself.

3.  For all other cases, it prints -1, indicating that there is no valid array `a` that satisfies the given conditions.

The program's logic is correct because it covers all possible cases and provides valid outputs for each case. The first case handles arrays where all elements are equal, the second case handles arrays with a single sorted cyclic shift, and the third case handles all other invalid cases.

Correctness: **True**
