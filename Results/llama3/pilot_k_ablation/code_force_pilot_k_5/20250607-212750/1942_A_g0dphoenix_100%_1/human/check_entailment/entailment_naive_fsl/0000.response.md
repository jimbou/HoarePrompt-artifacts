Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program should output -1, but instead, it outputs a sequence that does not satisfy the conditions. The correct output for this case should be -1, as there is no array a that satisfies the requirements.

In the given program, the condition for k == 1 is incorrect. The program prints a sequence of numbers from 1 to n, but this sequence does not satisfy the condition that exactly k cyclic shifts are sorted. For example, when n = 3 and k = 1, the program outputs "1 2 3", but this sequence has 3 sorted cyclic shifts, not 1.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
