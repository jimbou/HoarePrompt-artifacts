Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string has more than one character that appears only once. For example, if the input string is "ab", the program will print "Yes" and then print the sorted string "ab", which is the same as the original string. However, the problem statement requires the output string to be different from the original string.

In this case, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, so it is incorrect.
