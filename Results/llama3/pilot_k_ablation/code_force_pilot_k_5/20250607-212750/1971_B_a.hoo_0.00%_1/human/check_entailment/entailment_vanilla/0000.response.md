Reasoning:

1. The problem requires rearranging the characters of a given string `s` to form a new string `r` that is not equal to `s`, or reporting that it's impossible.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func()` that takes no arguments and performs the following operations:
   - Reads the number of test cases `cnt_test_cases` from the input.
   - Iterates over each test case:
     - Reads a string `string` from the input and strips any leading or trailing whitespace.
     - Checks if the length of the string is 1. If true, prints 'No' because a single-character string cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
     - Initializes variables `m` with the first character of the string and `k` to 0.
     - Iterates over each character in the string. If the character matches `m`, increments `k`.
     - Checks if `k` is equal to the length of the string. If true, prints 'No' because the string consists of identical characters and cannot be rearranged to form a different string.
     - If the string can be rearranged, prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string using `''.join(sorted(string))`.

3. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the string has a length of 1 or consists of identical characters.

4. For strings that can be rearranged, the program sorts the characters and prints the sorted string. This approach ensures that the resulting string is different from the original string, as required by the problem.

5. The program does not explicitly handle cases where multiple rearrangements are possible, but the problem statement allows for any valid rearrangement. The sorting approach used in the program provides one possible valid rearrangement.

6. The program does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws that would prevent it from producing the correct output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
