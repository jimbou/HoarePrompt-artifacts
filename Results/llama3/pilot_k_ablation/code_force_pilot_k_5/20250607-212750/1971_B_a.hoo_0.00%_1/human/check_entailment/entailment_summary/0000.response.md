Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly handles the case where the input string has only one character, and it also correctly handles the case where all characters in the string are the same. In the case where the string has more than one character and not all characters are the same, it prints 'Yes' followed by the sorted string, which is a valid rearrangement of the original string.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. The use of the `sorted` function to rearrange the string is a good approach, as it ensures that the resulting string is not equal to the original string.

Correctness: **True**
