Reasoning:

The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases `t` from the input and iterates over each test case.
2. For each test case, it checks if the length of the string is 1. If it is, it correctly prints 'No' because there is no way to rearrange a single character to form a different string.
3. The program then checks if all characters in the string are the same by comparing the first character `m` with each character in the string and counting the occurrences of `m`. If all characters are the same, it correctly prints 'No'.
4. If the string has more than one distinct character, the program prints 'Yes' and then prints the sorted string. This is a correct solution because sorting the string will always result in a different string if there are at least two distinct characters.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The execution states provided as comments also match the expected behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
