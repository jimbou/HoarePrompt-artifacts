To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(cnt_test_cases):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`, which is used to iterate over the range of `cnt_test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of the string, which means it has reached the end of the current test case. To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, we know that there are more test cases to process. Therefore, `cnt_test_cases` remains the same.

The other variables in the state, such as `string`, `m`, `stdin`, and `k`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to the length of string + 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `m` is the first character of string, `stdin` contains cnt_test_cases - 2 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in string.**
