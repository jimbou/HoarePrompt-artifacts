The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `string`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `string`. If `i` is less than `len(string)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 11, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `string` length must be greater than `i`. So `i` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 12 and `string` length is greater than `i`.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 12, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length greater than `i` and at most 11, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.**
