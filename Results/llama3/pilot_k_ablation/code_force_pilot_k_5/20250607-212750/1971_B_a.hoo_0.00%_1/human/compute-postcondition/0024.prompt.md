Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of string, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, 'No' is being printed. Otherwise, no specific action is taken.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(string)):
    if string[i] == m:
        k += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, m is the first character of string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index i of string is equal to m, then k is 1. Otherwise, k remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 2, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 2 or 3. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is not equal to `m`, then `k` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 3, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 3 or 4. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is not equal to `m`, then `k` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 4, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 4 or 5. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is not equal to `m`, then `k` is 2 or 3.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
