To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(len(string)):`. Therefore, we can only adjust the states of `i` and `string`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `string`. If `i` is less than the length of `string`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `string` has a length of at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The length of `string` remains the same.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 2, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.**
