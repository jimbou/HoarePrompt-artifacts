According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `cnt_test_cases`. If `cnt_test_cases` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `cnt_test_cases` is an integer t such that 1 <= t <= 1000, stdin contains t strings s, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 0 and i is now 0. 
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer t such that 1 <= t <= 1000, stdin contains t strings s, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `i` is 0,  `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 0**
