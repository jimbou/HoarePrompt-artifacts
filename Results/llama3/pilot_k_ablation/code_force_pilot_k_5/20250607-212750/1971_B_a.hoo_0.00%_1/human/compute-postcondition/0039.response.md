Output State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is equal to the length of the new string + 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, then 'No' is printed.**

The code modifies the values of `m` and `k`. The first line assigns the first character of `string` to `m`, and the second line sets `k` to 0. The value of `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, `string`, and the contents of stdin remain unchanged.
