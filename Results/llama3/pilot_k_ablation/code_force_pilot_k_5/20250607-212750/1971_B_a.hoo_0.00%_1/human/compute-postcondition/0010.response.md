The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The value of `k` was 0, so the value of `k` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains cnt_test_cases - 1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The current value of the character at index i of string is still equal to m.
Output State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, m is the first character of string, k is 1, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The current value of the character at index i of string is equal to m.**
