Output State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in the string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, 'No' is being printed. If k is equal to the length of the string, 'No' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is being printed, and the sorted characters of the string are being printed.**

In this output state, the value of string has been updated to the next input string from stdin, which consists of lowercase English letters and has a length of at most 10. The value of m is now the first character of this new string, and the value of k is the number of occurrences of m in this new string. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin now contains one less string than before, since one string has been read and assigned to the variable string.
