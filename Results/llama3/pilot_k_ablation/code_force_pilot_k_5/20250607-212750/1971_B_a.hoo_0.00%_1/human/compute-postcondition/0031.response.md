The code prints a string that is the sorted version of the string. Since the string consists of lowercase English letters, the sorted string will be in alphabetical order. The value of the string is not explicitly provided, but it is described as a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.

Output: **a string of lowercase English letters in alphabetical order (where the string is the sorted version of the input string)**
