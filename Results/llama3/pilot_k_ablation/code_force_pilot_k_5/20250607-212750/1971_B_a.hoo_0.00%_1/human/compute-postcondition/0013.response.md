Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, `m` is the first character of `string`, `k` is either 1 or 2, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is now 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
