The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `string`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `string`. If `i` is less than the length of `string`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is increased by 1 and the length of the string must be at least `i` + 1.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 2, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least `i` + 1, `m` is the first character of the string, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.**
