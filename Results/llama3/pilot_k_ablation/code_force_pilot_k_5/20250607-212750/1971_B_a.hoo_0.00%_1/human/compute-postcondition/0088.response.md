Output State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is equal to 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in the string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, 'No' is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over the entire string, and the value of `k` now represents the total number of occurrences of the first character `m` in the string. The other variables remain unchanged, with `cnt_test_cases` still being greater than 1, `i` being reset to 0, `string` being the same string, `m` being the first character of the string, and `stdin` containing the remaining input strings. If the length of the string is 1, the program prints 'No'.
