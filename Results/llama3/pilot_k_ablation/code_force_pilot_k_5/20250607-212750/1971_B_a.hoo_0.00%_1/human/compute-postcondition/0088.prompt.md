Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is equal to the length of the new string + 2, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, 'No' is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(string)):
    if string[i] == m:
        k += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, `m` is the first character of the string, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 2, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least `i` + 1, `m` is the first character of the string, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 3, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least `i` + 1, `m` is the first character of the string, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the value of `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 4, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 5, `m` is the first character of the string, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 5, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 5, `m` is the first character of the string, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
