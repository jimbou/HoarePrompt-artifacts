To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `string`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `string`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `string` has a length of at least 4 and at most 10. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.

The state of `string` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables, `cnt_test_cases`, `m`, `stdin`, and `k`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 4, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4 and at most 10, `m` is a character, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 7` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
