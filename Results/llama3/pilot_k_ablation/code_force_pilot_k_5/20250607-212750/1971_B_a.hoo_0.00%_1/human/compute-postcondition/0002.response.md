The code accepts a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `string`. The stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The values of the other variables are not affected. `cnt_test_cases` is still an integer greater than 0 and `i` is still 0. 
Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10**
