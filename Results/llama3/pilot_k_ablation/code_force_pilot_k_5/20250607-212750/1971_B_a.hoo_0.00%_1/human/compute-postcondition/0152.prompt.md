Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 2, i is equal to the length of the new string + 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 9 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, then 'No' is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(string)):
    if string[i] == m:
        k += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 11, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 1. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 12, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length greater than `i` and at most 11, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 3 and less than or equal to 13, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length greater than `i` and at most 11, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 4 and less than or equal to 14, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length greater than `i` and at most 11, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 3. Otherwise, `k` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 5 and less than or equal to 15, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length greater than `i` and at most 11, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` in `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
