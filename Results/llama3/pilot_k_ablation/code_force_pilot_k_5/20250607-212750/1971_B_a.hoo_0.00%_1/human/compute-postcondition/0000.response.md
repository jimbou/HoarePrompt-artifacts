The code `cnt_test_cases = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `cnt_test_cases`. 

In the initial state, stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t strings s. So, when `int(input())` is executed, it reads the first integer from the stdin and assigns it to `cnt_test_cases`. 

Therefore, the value of `cnt_test_cases` is an integer t such that 1 <= t <= 1000. 

The stdin now contains t strings s, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.

Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer t such that 1 <= t <= 1000, stdin contains t strings s, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**
