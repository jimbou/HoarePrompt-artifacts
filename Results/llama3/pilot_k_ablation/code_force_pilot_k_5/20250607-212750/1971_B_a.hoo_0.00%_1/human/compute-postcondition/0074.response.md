The code increments the value of `k` by 1. The initial value of `k` is 0, so after the increment, `k` becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, `m` is the first character of the string, `k` is 1, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The current value of `string[i]` is equal to `m`.**
