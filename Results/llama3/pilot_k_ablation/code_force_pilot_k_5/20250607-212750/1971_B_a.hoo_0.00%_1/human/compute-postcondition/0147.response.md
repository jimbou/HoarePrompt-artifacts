Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 4 and less than or equal to 14, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length greater than `i` and at most 11, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 3. Otherwise, `k` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been updated. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is now 3. Otherwise, `k` has been increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
