To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `string`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `len(string)` is at least 1. Since `i` is equal to the length of the new string + 2, we need to adjust `i` to be at least 1. Also, since the loop will iterate over the characters of `string`, we need to adjust `string` to have at least 1 character.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, `m` is the first character of the string, `k` is 0, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10**
