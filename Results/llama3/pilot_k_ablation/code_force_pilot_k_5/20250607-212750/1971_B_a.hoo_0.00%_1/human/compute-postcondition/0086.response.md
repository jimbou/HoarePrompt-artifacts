Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 5, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 5, `m` is the first character of the string, `k` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been increased by 1, regardless of the previous value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the condition that the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m` is still valid.
