To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `cnt_test_cases`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the length of the new string + 1, and `cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `cnt_test_cases`. Therefore, we need to increment `i` by 1.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is equal to the length of the new string + 2, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 4 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, then 'No' is printed. If all characters in the string are equal to m, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the sorted characters of the string are printed.**
