Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4 and at most 10, `m` is a character, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 7` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `k` is 1**

The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so it changes from either 0 or 1 to 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `cnt_test_cases - 7` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
