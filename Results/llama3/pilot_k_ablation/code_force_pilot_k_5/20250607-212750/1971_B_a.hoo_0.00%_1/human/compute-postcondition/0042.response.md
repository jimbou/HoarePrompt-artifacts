Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is at least 1 and at most 10, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, `m` is the first character of the string, `k` is 1, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The current value of `string` at index `i` is equal to `m`.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `k` being equal to 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `cnt_test_cases - 3` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The current value of `string` at index `i` is still equal to `m`.
