To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `string`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `string`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `string` has a length of at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The length of `string` remains the same.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, `k` remains 0.**
