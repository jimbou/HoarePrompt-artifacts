Output State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is equal to the length of string, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in string.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of the `string`, and the value of `k` will be equal to the number of occurrences of the character `m` in the `string`. The values of `cnt_test_cases`, `string`, `m`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged.
