Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is a character, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(string)):
    if string[i] == m:
        k += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, m is a character, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the first character of the string is equal to the character m, then k is 1. Otherwise, k remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 2 and at most 10, m is a character, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index i of the string is equal to the character m, then k is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, k remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 2, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 2 and at most 10, m is a character, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index i of the string is equal to the character m, then k is 1. Otherwise, k remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4 and at most 10, `m` is a character, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 7` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 1. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 4, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4 and at most 10, `m` is a character, `k` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 7` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
