Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 12, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length greater than `i` and at most 11, `m` is the first character of the string, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 1 + 1 = 2. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged and is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `cnt_test_cases`, `i`, `string`, `m` remains the same as the initial state. The value of `k` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 2. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged and is increased by 1. The stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
