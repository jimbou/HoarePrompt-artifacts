Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `cnt_test_cases` is an integer t such that 1 <= t <= 1000, stdin contains t strings s, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(cnt_test_cases):
    string = input().strip()
    if len(string) == 1:
        print('No')
    m = string[0]
    k = 0
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i] == m:
            k += 1
    if k == len(string):
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')
        print(''.join(sorted(string)))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is equal to the length of string, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 1 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in string. If k is equal to the length of string, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the string sorted alphabetically is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is equal to the length of the new string + 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, then 'No' is printed. If all characters in the string are equal to m, then 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the sorted characters of the string are printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is equal to 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in the string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, 'No' is being printed. If k is equal to the length of the string, 'No' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is being printed, and the sorted characters of the string are being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is equal to the length of string, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is a character, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If all characters in the string are equal to m, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the string is printed after being sorted in ascending order.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 2, i is greater than the length of the string, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 9 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If all characters in the string are the same as the first character of the string, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the sorted string is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
