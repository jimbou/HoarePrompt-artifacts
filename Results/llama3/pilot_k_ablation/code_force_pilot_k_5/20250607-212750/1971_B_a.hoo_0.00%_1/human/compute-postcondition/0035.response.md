Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is equal to the length of the new string + 1, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `m` is the first character of the new string, `k` is equal to the number of occurrences of `m` in the new string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `string` has been updated to the new input string, and the values of `i`, `m`, and `k` have been updated accordingly. The value of `cnt_test_cases` remains the same, and the stdin now contains one less string.
