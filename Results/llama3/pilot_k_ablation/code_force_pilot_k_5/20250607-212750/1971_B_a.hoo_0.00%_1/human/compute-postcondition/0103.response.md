Output State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is a character, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the first character of the string to the variable m. The second line initializes the variable k to 0. 

The initial state provides that m is the first character of the string, and k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in the string. After the code execution, m is still the first character of the string, but k is now 0, not the number of occurrences of m in the string. 

The other variables, cnt_test_cases, i, and string, are not affected by the code snippet. The state of stdin also remains unchanged.
