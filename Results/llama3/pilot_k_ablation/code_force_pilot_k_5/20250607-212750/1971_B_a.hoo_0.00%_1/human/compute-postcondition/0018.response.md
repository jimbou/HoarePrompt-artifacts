The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and string, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `string`. If `i` is less than `len(string)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `string` has a length of at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `string` must have a length of at least 3.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 3, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 2 or 3. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is not equal to `m`, then `k` is 1.**
