According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `string`. If the length of the string is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to the length of the new string + 1 and the length of string is at most 10, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is at least 1 and at most 10 and `string` must have at least 1 character.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is at least 1 and at most 10, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, `m` is the first character of the string, `k` is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10**
