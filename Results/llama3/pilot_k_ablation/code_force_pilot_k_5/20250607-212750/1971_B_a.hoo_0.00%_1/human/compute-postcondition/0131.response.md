The value of `string` is updated to the new input string, which is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The value of `i` is updated to be equal to the length of the new string + 1. The values of `cnt_test_cases`, `m`, and `k` are not affected. The stdin now contains `cnt_test_cases` - 9 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, as one string has been consumed by the input operation.
