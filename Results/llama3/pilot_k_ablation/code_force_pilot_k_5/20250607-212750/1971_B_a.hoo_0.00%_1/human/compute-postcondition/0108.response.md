The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and string, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string.  If the string has at least 2 characters the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, string has at least 1 and at most 10 characters, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 2 characters and the index is 1.
State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 2 and at most 10, m is a character, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the first character of the string is equal to the character m, then k is 1. Otherwise, k remains 0.**
