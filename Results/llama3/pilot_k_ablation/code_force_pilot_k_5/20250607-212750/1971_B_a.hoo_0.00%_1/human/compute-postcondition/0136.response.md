According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `string`. If the length of `string` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to the length of the new string + 1 and the length of string is at most 10, so `i` must be greater than 1 and less than or equal to 11 and the length of string must be at least 1. Also, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The other variables do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 11, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, `m` is the first character of the string, `k` is 0, stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 9` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10**
