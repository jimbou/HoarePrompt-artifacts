Output State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 0, i is equal to the length of the new string + 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, then 'No' is printed.**

This output state indicates that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of the string plus one, and the value of `k` will be equal to the number of occurrences of the character `m` in the string. The other variables remain unchanged.
