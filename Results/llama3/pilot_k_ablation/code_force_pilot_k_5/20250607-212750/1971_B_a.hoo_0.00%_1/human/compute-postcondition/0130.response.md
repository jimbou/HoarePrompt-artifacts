The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `cnt_test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cnt_test_cases`. If `i` is less than `cnt_test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to the length of string, `cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 2, i is equal to the length of string + 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is a character, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 8 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If all characters in the string are equal to m, 'No' is printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is printed, and the string is printed after being sorted in ascending order.**
