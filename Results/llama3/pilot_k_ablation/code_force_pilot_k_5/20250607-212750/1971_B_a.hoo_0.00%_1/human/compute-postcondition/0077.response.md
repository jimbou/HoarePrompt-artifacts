Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 2, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least `i` + 1, `m` is the first character of the string, `k` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is set to 1 plus its original value. Otherwise, the value of `k` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` is increased by 1, regardless of whether the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m` or not. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.
