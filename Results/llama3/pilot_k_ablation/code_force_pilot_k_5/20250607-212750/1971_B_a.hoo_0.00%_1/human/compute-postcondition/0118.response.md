Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 4, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4 and at most 10, `m` is a character, `k` is either 2 or 1 depending on whether the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 7` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is now 2; otherwise, `k` remains 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
