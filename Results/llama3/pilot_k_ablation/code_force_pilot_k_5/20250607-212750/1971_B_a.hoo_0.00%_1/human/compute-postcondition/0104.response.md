The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and string, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `string`. If string has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is a character, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10 does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `string` has at least 1 character and i is now 0. 
State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 0, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, m is a character, k is 0, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10**
