The value of `k` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `k` is 0, so the value of `k` is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The current value of the first character of the string is still equal to the character m.

Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 0, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 1 and at most 10, `m` is a character, `k` is 1, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 7 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. The current value of the first character of the string is equal to the character m.**
