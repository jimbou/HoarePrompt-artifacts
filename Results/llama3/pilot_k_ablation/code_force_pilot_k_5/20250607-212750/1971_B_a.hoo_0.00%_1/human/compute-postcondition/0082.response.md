To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(string)):`. This means that the only objects in the loop head are `i` and `string`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `string`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 3, and `string` has a length of at least `i` + 1.

To adjust the states for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1. Therefore, `i` becomes at least 4.

The length of `string` remains the same, but we need to ensure that it is still at least `i` + 1. Since `i` is now at least 4, `string` must have a length of at least 5.

The other variables, `cnt_test_cases`, `m`, `stdin`, and `k`, are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is at least 4, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 5, `m` is the first character of the string, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases` - 5 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, `k` is an integer (its value is not specified)**
