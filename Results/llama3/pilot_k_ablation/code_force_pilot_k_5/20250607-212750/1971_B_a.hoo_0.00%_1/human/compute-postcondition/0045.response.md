Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is at least 2 and at most 10, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 2 and at most 10, `m` is the first character of the string, if the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 2, otherwise, `k` is 1, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1. If the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is now 2, otherwise, `k` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
