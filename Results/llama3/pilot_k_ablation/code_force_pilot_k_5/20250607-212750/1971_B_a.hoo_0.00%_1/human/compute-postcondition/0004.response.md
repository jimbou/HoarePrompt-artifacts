Based on the initial state, the code will print the string 'No'.

The variable `cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, but its value is not used in the print statement. The variable `i` is 0, but it is also not used in the print statement. The variable `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of 1, but it is not used in the print statement either.

The stdin contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, but this information is not relevant to the print statement.

Therefore, the print statement will simply print the string 'No', without any variables or objects being used.

Output: **No**
