The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `cnt_test_cases`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `cnt_test_cases`. If `i` is less than `cnt_test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `cnt_test_cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `cnt_test_cases` must be greater than 1.
State: **cnt_test_cases is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, string is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10, m is the first character of the string, k is equal to the number of occurrences of m in the string, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 6 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the length of string is 1, 'No' is being printed. If k is equal to the length of the string, 'No' is being printed. Otherwise, 'Yes' is being printed, and the sorted characters of the string are being printed.**
