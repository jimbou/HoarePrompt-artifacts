The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `string`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `string`. If `i` is less than `len(string)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 4 and at most 11, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4 and at most 11. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be increased by 1 and `string` length must be greater than `i`. So `i` is at least 5 and at most 12 and `string` length is at least 5 and at most 12.
State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is at least 5 and at most 12, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 5 and at most 12, `m` is the first character of the string, if the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is 4, otherwise, `k` is 3, stdin contains cnt_test_cases - 3 strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10.**
