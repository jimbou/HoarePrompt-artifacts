To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `string`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `string`. If `i` is less than the length of `string`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `string` has a length of at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `i` is now 4, the length of `string` must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 4, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 4, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 3 or 4. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is not equal to `m`, then `k` is 2.**
