Output State: **`cnt_test_cases` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 2, `string` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at least 2, `m` is the first character of `string`, `stdin` contains `cnt_test_cases - 1` strings, each consisting of lowercase English letters and having a length of at most 10. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 2 or 3. Otherwise, `k` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `k` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of the character at index `i` of `string` is equal to `m`, then `k` is either 2 or 3, because it was either 1 or 2 before the increment. Otherwise, `k` is 1, because it was 0 before the increment. The values of the other variables remain the same.
