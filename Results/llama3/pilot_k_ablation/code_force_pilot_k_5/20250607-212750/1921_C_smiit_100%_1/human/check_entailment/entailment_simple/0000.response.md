Reasoning: 
The given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Stepan can send all the messages without the possibility of charging the phone. It iterates through each message, calculates the energy cost of keeping the phone on and turning it off and on, and updates the remaining energy accordingly. If the remaining energy is less than or equal to the energy cost at any point, it sets the `possible` flag to `False` and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints "YES" if `possible` is `True` and "NO" otherwise.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the energy cost of keeping the phone on is less than the energy cost of turning it off and on, and when the remaining energy is not enough to send the next message.

Correctness: **True**
