Output State: **n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n+1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is True if f is greater than the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.**

In this output state, the values of n, f, a, b, arr, i, time_diff, energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on, energy_cost, and possible are updated based on the input provided. The value of possible is determined by comparing f with the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n. If f is greater than this minimum value for all i, possible is True; otherwise, it is False. The value of possible then determines whether 'YES' or 'NO' is printed.
