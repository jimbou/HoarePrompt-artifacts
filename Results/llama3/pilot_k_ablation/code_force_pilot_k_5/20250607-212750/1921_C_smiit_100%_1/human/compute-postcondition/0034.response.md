Output State: **n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is True, and 'NO' is printed, _ is 1**

In this output state, the values of n, f, a, and b have been updated to the values provided by the user input. The list arr has been populated with n+1 integers, where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. The variable possible has been set to True, indicating that the program has reached a state where it is possible to proceed. The value of _ remains unchanged at 1. The program has also printed 'NO' to the output.
