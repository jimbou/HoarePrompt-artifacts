Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 3, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `possible` to `False`, overriding its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the output state.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `possible` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
