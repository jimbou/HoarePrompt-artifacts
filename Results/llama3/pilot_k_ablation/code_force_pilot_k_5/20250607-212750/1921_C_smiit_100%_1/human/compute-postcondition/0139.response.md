The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is the difference between the last and second last elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` is True if `f` is greater than the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of `possible`.**
