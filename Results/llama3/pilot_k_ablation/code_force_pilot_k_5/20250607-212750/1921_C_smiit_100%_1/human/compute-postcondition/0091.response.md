Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a` times `time_diff` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is an integer equal to the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, and if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been decreased by the minimum cost of keeping the energy on or turning it off and on, which is the minimum of `a` times the time difference and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of `f` is now a non-negative integer, and if it is less than or equal to the energy cost, then `possible` is False.
