The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `n+1`. So `i` is increased by 2 and `n` is a positive integer greater than `i-1`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i-1`, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is increased by 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged**
