Output State: **n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and f minus the sum of the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, 'NO' is printed, _ is 1, i is n+1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[n] - arr[n-1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]) and b.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations. The value of `f` is the maximum of 0 and the initial value of `f` minus the sum of the minimum energy costs for each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged, with `possible` being False and `'NO'` being printed. The loop counter `i` is now `n+1`, and the time difference, energy keep on, energy turn off on, and energy cost are updated to their values for the last iteration.
