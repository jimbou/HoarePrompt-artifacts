Output State: **t is at least 1, n, f, a, and b are positive integers, n is a positive integer greater than 0, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and the current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost.**

The code snippet sets the value of `possible` to `False` and then encounters a `break` statement, which terminates the loop or the closest enclosing loop. Since there is no loop provided in the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state. Therefore, the only change in the state is that `possible` becomes `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
