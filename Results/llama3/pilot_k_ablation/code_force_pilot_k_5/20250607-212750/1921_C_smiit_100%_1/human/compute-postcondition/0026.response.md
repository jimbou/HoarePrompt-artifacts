Output State: **t is at least 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 5, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, f is a positive integer decreased by energy_cost, and possible is False.**

In this output state, the values of t, n, a, b, arr, and possible remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of i is also unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of time_diff is updated to be the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr. The value of energy_keep_on is updated to be the product of a and time_diff. The value of energy_turn_off_on is updated to be b. The value of energy_cost is updated to be the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on. The value of f is updated to be a positive integer decreased by energy_cost.
