Output State: **t is at least 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 2, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on.**

The code updates the values of time_diff, energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on, and energy_cost. The new value of time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, which is arr[2] - arr[1]. The new value of energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, which is a * (arr[2] - arr[1]). The value of energy_turn_off_on remains the same, which is b. The new value of energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, which is min(a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), b).
