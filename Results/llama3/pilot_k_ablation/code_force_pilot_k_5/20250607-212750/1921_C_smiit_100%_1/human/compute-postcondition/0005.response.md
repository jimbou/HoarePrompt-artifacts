Output State: **t is at least 1, n, f, a, and b are positive integers, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is True, `i` is 1,  `n` must be greater than 0, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `possible`, and `i` remain unchanged from the initial state. The code introduces four new variables: `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`. 

`time_diff` is calculated as the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`th elements of `arr`. Since `i` is 1, this means `time_diff` is the difference between the first and second elements of `arr`, which are 0 and `m_1`, respectively. So, `time_diff` is equal to `m_1`.

`energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, which is `a * m_1`.

`energy_turn_off_on` is simply `b`.

`energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, which means it will be the smaller of `a * m_1` and `b`.
