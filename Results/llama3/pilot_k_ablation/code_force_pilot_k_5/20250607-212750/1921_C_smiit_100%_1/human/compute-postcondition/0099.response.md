Postcondition: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is True if f is greater than the sum of the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, _ is 3, i is 1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[i] - arr[i-1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b, and 'YES' is printed if possible is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, t must be greater than 3. The current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost.**
