Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, possible is a boolean, _ is 2, i is 2, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[2] - arr[1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[2] - arr[1]) and b, and 'NO' is printed, t must be greater than 1**

The code snippet modifies the values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`. The value of `time_diff` is calculated as the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in the list `arr`, which are `arr[2]` and `arr[1]` respectively. The value of `energy_keep_on` is calculated as the product of `a` and `time_diff`. The value of `energy_turn_off_on` is set to `b`. The value of `energy_cost` is calculated as the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. All other variables remain unchanged.
