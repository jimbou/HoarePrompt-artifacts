Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is True if f is greater than the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.**

The code updates the values of time_diff, energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on, and energy_cost. The value of time_diff is now the difference between the last and second last elements of arr. The value of energy_keep_on is now a times time_diff. The value of energy_turn_off_on is now b. The value of energy_cost is now the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on. The values of n, f, a, b, arr, i, possible, _, and t remain unchanged.
