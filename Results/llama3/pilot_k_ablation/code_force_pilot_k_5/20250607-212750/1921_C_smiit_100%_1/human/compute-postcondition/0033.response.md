The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is not defined (since it's a throwaway variable), and `t` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be 1 (since it starts from 0) and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, `i` is n, `time_diff` is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, `energy_keep_on` is the product of a and time_diff, `energy_turn_off_on` is b, `energy_cost` is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, `possible` is False, and 'NO' is printed, `_` is 1**
