Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, f is a non-negative integer decreased by energy_cost, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[i] - arr[i - 1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) and b, t must be greater than 1, i is 3, possible is False**

The code snippet does not modify the values of any variables except for `possible`, which is assigned the value `False`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables. All other variables retain their initial values.
