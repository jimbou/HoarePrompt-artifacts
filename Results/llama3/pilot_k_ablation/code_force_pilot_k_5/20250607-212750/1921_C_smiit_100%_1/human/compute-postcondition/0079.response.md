Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, f is a non-negative integer and is decreased by the minimum of a * (arr[2] - arr[1]) and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[2] - arr[1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[2] - arr[1]) and b, t must be greater than 1, i is 2, possible is False, and 'NO' is printed.**

The code snippet provided does not modify any of the existing variables or their values. The first line sets the variable `possible` to `False`, and the second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the addition of `possible` being `False` and `'NO'` being printed.
