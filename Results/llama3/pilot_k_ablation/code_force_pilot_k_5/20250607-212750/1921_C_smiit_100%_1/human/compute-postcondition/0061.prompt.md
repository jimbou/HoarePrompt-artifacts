Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is True, and 'NO' is printed, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a * m_1` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is False, `'NO'` is printed, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `m_1`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * m_1`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * m_1` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a positive integer equal to f minus the minimum of a * m_1 and b minus the minimum of a * (m_2 - m_1) and b, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to m_2 - m_1, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to a * (m_2 - m_1), `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to b, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (m_2 - m_1) and b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a positive integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `f` is a positive integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[4] - arr[3])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 4, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[4] - arr[3]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[4] - arr[3])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[4] - arr[3])` and `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `f` is a positive integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the minimum of `a` * (`arr[4]` - `arr[3]`) and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 5, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[5]` - `arr[4]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a` * (`arr[5]` - `arr[4]`), `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` * (`arr[5]` - `arr[4]`) and `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
