Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a positive integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b` from its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
