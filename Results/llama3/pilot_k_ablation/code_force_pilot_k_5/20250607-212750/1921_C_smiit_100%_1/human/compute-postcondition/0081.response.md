Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by `energy_cost`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `f` has been decreased by `energy_cost`, which is the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. Note that the condition "If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is `False`, `'NO'` is printed, and `f` is decreased by `energy_cost`. Otherwise, no changes are made" is not executed in this code snippet, so the value of `possible` and the printing of `'NO'` are not affected.
