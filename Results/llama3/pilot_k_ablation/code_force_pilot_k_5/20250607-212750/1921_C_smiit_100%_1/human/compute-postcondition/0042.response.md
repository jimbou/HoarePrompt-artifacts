Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, f is a positive integer equal to f minus the minimum of a * m_1 and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, 'NO' is printed, _ is 1, i is 2, time_diff is a positive integer equal to m_2 - m_1, energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (m_2 - m_1), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (m_2 - m_1) and b.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `possible`, `'NO'`, `_`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `time_diff` is updated to `m_2 - m_1`, which is the difference between the second and first elements of the `arr` list. The value of `energy_keep_on` is updated to `a * (m_2 - m_1)`, which is the product of `a` and the new value of `time_diff`. The value of `energy_turn_off_on` remains the same as `b`. The value of `energy_cost` is updated to the minimum of `a * (m_2 - m_1)` and `b`, which is the minimum of the new value of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.
