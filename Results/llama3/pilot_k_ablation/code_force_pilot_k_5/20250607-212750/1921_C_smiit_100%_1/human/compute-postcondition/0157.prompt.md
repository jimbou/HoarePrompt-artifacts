Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer (n), `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, including the second line of the first test case with n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
    possible = True
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
        energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
        energy_turn_off_on = b
        energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
        if f <= energy_cost:
            possible = False
            break
        f -= energy_cost
    print('YES' if possible else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is at least 1, n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer decreased by the minimum of a times the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False, and 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and f minus the sum of the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, 'NO' is printed, _ is 1, i is n+1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[n] - arr[n-1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]) and b, and 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is True if `f` is greater than the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 2, `i` is `n+1`, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])` and `b`, and 'YES' is printed if `possible` is True, otherwise 'NO' is printed, `t` must be greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is a positive integer greater than 0, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of a * time_diff and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n+1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, and possible is False if f is less than or equal to the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for any i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is True, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n+1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise possible is True if f is greater than the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
