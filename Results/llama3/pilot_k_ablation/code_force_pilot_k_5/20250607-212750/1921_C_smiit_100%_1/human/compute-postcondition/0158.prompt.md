You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b. The second line contains n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. n is a positive integer, f, a, and b are positive integers, and m_i are positive integers such that m_i < m_{i+1} for all i.
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, f, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        arr = [0] + list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        possible = True
        
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
            energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
            energy_turn_off_on = b
            energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
            if f <= energy_cost:
                possible = False
                break
            f -= energy_cost
        
        print('YES' if possible else 'NO')
        
    #State: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n+1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise possible is True if f is greater than the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.

Return Postconditions: t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n+1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise possible is True if f is greater than the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
