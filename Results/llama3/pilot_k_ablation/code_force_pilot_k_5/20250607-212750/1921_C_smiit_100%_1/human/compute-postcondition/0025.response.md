To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 5, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 5.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 5, `time_diff` is the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`th elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `f` is a positive integer decreased by `energy_cost` and `possible` is False**
