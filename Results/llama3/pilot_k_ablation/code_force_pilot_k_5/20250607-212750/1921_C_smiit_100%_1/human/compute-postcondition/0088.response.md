Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, time_diff is an integer equal to the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, t must be greater than 1, i is 4, possible is a boolean value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `t`, `i`, and `possible` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are updated based on the calculations performed in the code. Specifically, `time_diff` is set to the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is set to `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is set to `b`, and `energy_cost` is set to the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`.
