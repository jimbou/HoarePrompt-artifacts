Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a positive integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a * m_1` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is False, `'NO'` is printed, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `m_1`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * m_1`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * m_1` and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been reduced by the minimum of `a * m_1` and `b`, which is the energy cost. All other variables remain unchanged. The function continues with the updated value of `f`.
