Output State: **n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, 'NO' is printed, _ is 1, i is 1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to m_1, energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * m_1, energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * m_1 and b. The current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `possible` to `False`, overriding its initial value of `True`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or the closest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the state.

All other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `_`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet. The condition that the current value of `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost` also remains valid.
