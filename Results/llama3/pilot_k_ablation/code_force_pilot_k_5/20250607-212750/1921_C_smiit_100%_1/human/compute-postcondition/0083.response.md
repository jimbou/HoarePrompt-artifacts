Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, f is a non-negative integer decreased by energy_cost, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[i] - arr[i - 1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1]) and b, t must be greater than 1, i is 3**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `f` is decreased by `energy_cost`, but its exact value is not specified. The values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are updated based on the new values of `i` and the corresponding elements in the `arr` list.
