Functionality: **This function determines whether it is possible to keep a device on for a certain amount of time given its initial energy level and the energy costs of keeping it on versus turning it off and on again. It takes multiple test cases as input, each consisting of the initial energy level, the energy costs of keeping the device on and turning it off, and a list of time intervals. For each test case, it calculates the minimum energy cost for each time interval and checks if the device can be kept on for the entire duration. If the device can be kept on, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.**
