Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is True if `f` is greater than the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 2, `i` is `n+1`, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[n] - arr[n-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1])` and `b`, and 'NO' is printed if `possible` is False, `t` must be greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the value of `f` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and the initial value of `f` minus the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`. The value of `possible` is set to True if `f` is greater than the sum of the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise it is set to False. The values of `a`, `b`, `arr`, `_`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain unchanged. If `possible` is False, 'NO' is printed.
