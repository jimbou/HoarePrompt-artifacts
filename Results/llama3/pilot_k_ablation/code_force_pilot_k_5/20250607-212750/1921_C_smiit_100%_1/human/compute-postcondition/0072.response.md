To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, and `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `possible` is a boolean, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `time_diff` is a positive integer, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer, `energy_cost` is a positive integer, and 'NO' is printed, `t` must be greater than 1**
