Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 2, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, time_diff is an integer equal to the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, t must be greater than 1, i is 4. If f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
