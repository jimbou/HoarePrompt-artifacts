Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `f` is a positive integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the minimum of `a` * (`arr[4]` - `arr[3]`) and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 5, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[5]` - `arr[4]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a` * (`arr[5]` - `arr[4]`), `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a` * (`arr[5]` - `arr[4]`) and `b`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `f` has been updated to be the maximum of 0 and its previous value minus the minimum of `a` * (`arr[4]` - `arr[3]`) and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
