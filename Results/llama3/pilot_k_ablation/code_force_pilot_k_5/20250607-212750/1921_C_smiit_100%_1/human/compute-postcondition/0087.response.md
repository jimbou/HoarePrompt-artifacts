To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `n` is already greater than 2, it remains the same.

The other variables, such as `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `t`, and `possible`, are not part of the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is a positive integer, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer, `energy_cost` is a positive integer, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, `possible` is a boolean value**
