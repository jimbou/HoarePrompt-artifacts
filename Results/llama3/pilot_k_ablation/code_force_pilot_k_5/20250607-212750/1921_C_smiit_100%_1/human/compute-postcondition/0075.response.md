Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 1, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[2] - arr[1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[2] - arr[1]) and b, and t must be greater than 1. If f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False and 'NO' is printed.***
