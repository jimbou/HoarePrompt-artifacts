Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`-th elements of `arr` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is increased by 1, `time_diff` is the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`-th elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`-th elements of `arr` and `b`. All other variables remain unchanged. If `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`-th elements of `arr` and `b`, then `possible` is False.
