Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is False, otherwise `possible` is True, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[i] - arr[i-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b`, and 'NO' is printed, `t` must be greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` is updated by subtracting the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` from it, while keeping all other variables unchanged. The condition for `possible` remains the same, and 'NO' is still printed.
