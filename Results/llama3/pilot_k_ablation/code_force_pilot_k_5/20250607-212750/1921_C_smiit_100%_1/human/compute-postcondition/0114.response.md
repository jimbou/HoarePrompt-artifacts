Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is increased by 2, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise possible remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `arr` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is increased by 2, but its exact value is not specified. The values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are updated based on the calculations performed in the code. The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a` times the difference between the `i`-th and `(i-1)`-th elements of `arr` and `b`, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `possible` is set to False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise it remains unchanged.
