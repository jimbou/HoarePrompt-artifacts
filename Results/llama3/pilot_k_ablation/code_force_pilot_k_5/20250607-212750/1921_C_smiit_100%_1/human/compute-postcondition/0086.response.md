Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, which is the energy cost. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `n`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `t`, and `i` are still valid. Additionally, if the new value of `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, then `possible` is False.
