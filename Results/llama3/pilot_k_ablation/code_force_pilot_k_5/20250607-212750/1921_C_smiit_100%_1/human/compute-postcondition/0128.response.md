To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Since `i` is currently `n+1`, we need to adjust it to be within the range of the loop, which is from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, we can adjust `i` to be 1, which is the starting value of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is the difference between the last and second last elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `possible` is True if `f` is greater than the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of `possible`.**
