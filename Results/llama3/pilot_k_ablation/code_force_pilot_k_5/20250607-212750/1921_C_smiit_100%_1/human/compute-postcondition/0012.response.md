Output State: **t is at least 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 2, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False.**

The code block does not modify any of the existing variables or their values. The first line assigns the value False to the variable possible, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The second line, break, does not have any effect on the variables or their values because it is not inside a loop or a conditional statement. Therefore, the final state includes all the variables from the initial state with their original values, plus the new variable possible with the value False.
