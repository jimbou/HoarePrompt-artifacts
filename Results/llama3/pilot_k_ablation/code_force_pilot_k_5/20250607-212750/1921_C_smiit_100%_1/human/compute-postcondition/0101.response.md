Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. If f is less than or equal to the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b, then possible is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
