Output State: **t is at least 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, f is a positive integer decreased by the minimum of a times the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 3, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`, which means that the condition for `possible` being `True` is no longer met. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or the current execution block. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the output state.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the variable `possible`, which is now set to `False`. The values of `t`, `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` remain the same as in the initial state.
