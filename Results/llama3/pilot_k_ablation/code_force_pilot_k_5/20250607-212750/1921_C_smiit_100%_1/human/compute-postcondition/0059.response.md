Postcondition: **n is a positive integer greater than 4, f is a positive integer equal to the maximum of 0 and f minus the minimum of a * (arr[4] - arr[3]) and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, _ is 1, i is 5, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[5] - arr[4], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[5] - arr[4]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[5] - arr[4]) and b. If f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then the function executes with the given values. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
