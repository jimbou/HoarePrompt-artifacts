Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `t = int(input())`:
	* `input()` reads a line from stdin, which contains multiple test cases.
	* Since each test case has two lines, the first line is read, which contains four space-separated integers: n, f, a, and b.
	* `int(input())` converts the first integer (n) to an integer and assigns it to `t`.

Now, let's calculate the output state:

* `t` is assigned the value of the first integer (n) from the first line of the first test case.
* The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are not affected, as they are not assigned any new values.
* The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, including the second line of the first test case with n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (n), `n`, `f`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, stdin contains multiple test cases, including the second line of the first test case with n space-separated integers: m_1, m_2, ..., m_n.**
