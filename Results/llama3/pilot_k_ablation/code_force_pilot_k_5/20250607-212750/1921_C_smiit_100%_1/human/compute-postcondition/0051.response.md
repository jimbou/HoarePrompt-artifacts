To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

Currently, `i` is 3, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.

Since `n` is greater than 1, it must be at least 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state (`f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `possible`, `_`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`) are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `f` is a positive integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 4, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[3] - arr[2])` and `b`.**
