To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `n` is already greater than or equal to 2, it remains the same.

The other variables, such as `t`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, `energy_cost`, `f`, and `possible`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `i` is 4, `time_diff` is the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is the product of `a` and `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `f` is a positive integer decreased by `energy_cost`, `possible` is False**
