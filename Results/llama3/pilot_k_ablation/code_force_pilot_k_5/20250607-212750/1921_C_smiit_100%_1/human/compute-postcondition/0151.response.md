Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 4, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 5, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`, overriding its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the execution of the current loop or switch statement. However, since there is no loop or switch statement in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that the value of `possible` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
