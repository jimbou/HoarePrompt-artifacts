The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, and `t` must be greater than 1. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is `False` and `'NO'` is printed, `i` is 2**
