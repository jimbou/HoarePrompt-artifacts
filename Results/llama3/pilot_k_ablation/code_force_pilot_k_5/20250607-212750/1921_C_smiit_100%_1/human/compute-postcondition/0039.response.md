Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, 'NO' is printed, _ is 1, i is 1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to m_1, energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * m_1, energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * m_1 and b. If f is less than or equal to energy_cost, the function terminates with 'NO' printed. Otherwise, the function continues with the current values of n, f, a, b, arr, time_diff, energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on, and energy_cost.***
