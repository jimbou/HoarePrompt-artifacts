Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 0, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is increased by 2, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line sets the value of `possible` to `False`, regardless of its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the output state. Therefore, the only change in the output state is that `possible` is now `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
