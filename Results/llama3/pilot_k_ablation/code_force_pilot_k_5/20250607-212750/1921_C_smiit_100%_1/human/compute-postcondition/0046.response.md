To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a positive integer equal to f minus the minimum of a * m_1 and b minus the minimum of a * (m_2 - m_1) and b, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to m_2 - m_1, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to a * (m_2 - m_1), `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to b, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (m_2 - m_1) and b**
