Output State: **n is a positive integer, f is a positive integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is True, 'NO' is printed, _ is 1, i is 1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to m_1, energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * m_1, energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * m_1 and b.**

The code snippet calculates the time difference between the first two elements of the list `arr` and assigns it to `time_diff`. It then calculates the energy cost of keeping a device on for this time period (`energy_keep_on`) and the energy cost of turning it off and on (`energy_turn_off_on`). Finally, it determines the minimum of these two energy costs and assigns it to `energy_cost`. The values of `n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `possible`, and `_` remain unchanged.
