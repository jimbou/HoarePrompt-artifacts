Output State: **t is at least 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 4, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, f is a positive integer decreased by energy_cost, possible is False**

The code snippet updates the values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`. The value of `time_diff` is updated to be the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)th` elements of `arr`. The value of `energy_keep_on` is updated to be the product of `a` and the new value of `time_diff`. The value of `energy_turn_off_on` remains the same as `b`. The value of `energy_cost` is updated to be the minimum of the new values of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. The value of `f` is decreased by the new value of `energy_cost`. The value of `possible` remains False.
