To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `i` must be equal to the current value of `i` plus 1.

The state of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is increased by 1, `time_diff` is the difference between the `i`th and `(i-1)`th elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is False, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1**
