Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, possible is False, _ is 2, i is 2, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[2] - arr[1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[2] - arr[1]) and b, and 'NO' is printed, t must be greater than 1**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`, which was previously a boolean. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the nearest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the output state.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is the value of `possible`, which is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
