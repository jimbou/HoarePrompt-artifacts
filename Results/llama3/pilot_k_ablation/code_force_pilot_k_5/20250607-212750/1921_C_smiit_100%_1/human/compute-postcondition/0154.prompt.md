Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n+1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a * time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is True if f is greater than the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, _ is 1, t must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is the difference between the last and second last elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` is True if `f` is greater than the minimum of `a` * (`arr[i]` - `arr[i-1]`) and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of `possible`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 3, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of `a * time_diff` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `i` is 4, `time_diff` is the difference between the last and second last elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a * time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` is True if `f` is greater than the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of `possible`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `i` is 5, `time_diff` is the difference between the last and second last elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` is True if `f` is greater than the minimum of `a` times (`arr[i] - arr[i-1]`) and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is False. Either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of `possible`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
