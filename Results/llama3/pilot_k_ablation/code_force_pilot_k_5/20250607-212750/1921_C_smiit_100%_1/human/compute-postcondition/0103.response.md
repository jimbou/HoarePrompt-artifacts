The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value between 1 and `n` (inclusive), and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by `energy_cost`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is increased by 1**
