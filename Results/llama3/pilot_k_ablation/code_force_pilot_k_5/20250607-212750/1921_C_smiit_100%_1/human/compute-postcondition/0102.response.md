Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by `energy_cost`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`. If `f - energy_cost` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b`, then `possible` is False and 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been decreased by `energy_cost`. All other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `possible` being False and 'NO' being printed is still dependent on the comparison between `f - energy_cost` and the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b`.
