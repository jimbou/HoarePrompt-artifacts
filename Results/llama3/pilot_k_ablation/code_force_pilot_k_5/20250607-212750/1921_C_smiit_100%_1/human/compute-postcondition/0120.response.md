Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than i-1, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is increased by 2, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False**.

The code snippet sets the value of `possible` to `False` and then breaks out of the loop or conditional statement it is part of. This means that the value of `possible` is directly changed to `False`, regardless of its previous value or any conditions. The `break` statement does not affect any variables but rather controls the flow of the program, exiting the current loop or conditional block. As a result, all other variables (`n`, `f`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `i`, `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost`) remain unchanged from their initial state.
