The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 5 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `f` is a positive integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[4] - arr[3])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `possible` is False, `_` is 1, `i` is 5, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[4] - arr[3]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[4] - arr[3])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[4] - arr[3])` and `b`.**
