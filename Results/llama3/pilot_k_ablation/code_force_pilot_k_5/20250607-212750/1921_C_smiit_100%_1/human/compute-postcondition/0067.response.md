Output State: **n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and f minus the sum of the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is True, 'NO' is printed, _ is 2, i is 1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[i] - arr[i-1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b, and 'NO' is printed, t must be greater than 1**

The code updates the values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` based on the current values of `arr`, `a`, `b`, and `i`. The value of `time_diff` is updated to be the difference between the current element and the previous element in the `arr` list. The value of `energy_keep_on` is updated to be the product of `a` and `time_diff`. The value of `energy_turn_off_on` is updated to be equal to `b`. The value of `energy_cost` is updated to be the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
