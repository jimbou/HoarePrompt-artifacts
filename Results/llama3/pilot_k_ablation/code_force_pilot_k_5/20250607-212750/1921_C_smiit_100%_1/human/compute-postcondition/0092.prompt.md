Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and f minus the sum of the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is True, 'NO' is printed, _ is 2, i is n+1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[n] - arr[n-1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[n] - arr[n-1]) and b, and 'NO' is printed, t must be greater than 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    time_diff = arr[i] - arr[i - 1]
    energy_keep_on = a * time_diff
    energy_turn_off_on = b
    energy_cost = min(energy_keep_on, energy_turn_off_on)
    if f <= energy_cost:
        possible = False
        break
    f -= energy_cost


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, `possible` is False, otherwise `possible` is True, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[i] - arr[i-1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b`, and 'NO' is printed, `t` must be greater than 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a non-negative integer and is decreased by the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, and `t` must be greater than 1. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is `False` and `'NO'` is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by `energy_cost`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is a positive integer equal to `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i - 1])` and `b`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `f` is a non-negative integer equal to `f` minus the minimum of `a` times `time_diff` and `b`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers, `time_diff` is an integer equal to the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is a positive integer equal to `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is a positive integer equal to `b`, `energy_cost` is a positive integer equal to the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `t` must be greater than 1, `i` is 4, and if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
