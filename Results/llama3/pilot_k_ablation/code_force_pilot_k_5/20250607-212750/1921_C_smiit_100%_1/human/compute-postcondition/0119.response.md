Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than i-1, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is increased by 2, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise possible remains unchanged.**

The code block calculates the time difference between the i-th and (i-1)-th elements of the array, then uses this value to calculate the energy costs of keeping on and turning off/on. The minimum of these two energy costs is assigned to energy_cost. The value of f is decreased by the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on. The possible variable is set to False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise it remains unchanged.
