Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 1, f is a positive integer equal to f minus the minimum of a * m_1 and b minus the minimum of a * (m_2 - m_1) and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, _ is 1, i is 3, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[3] - arr[2], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[3] - arr[2]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[3] - arr[2]) and b.**

The code updates the values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` based on the values of `arr`, `a`, and `b`. The value of `time_diff` is now the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in the `arr` list. The value of `energy_keep_on` is now the product of `a` and `time_diff`. The value of `energy_turn_off_on` remains the same as `b`. The value of `energy_cost` is now the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`. The other variables remain unchanged.
