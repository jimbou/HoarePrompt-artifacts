Output State: **t is at least 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, f is a positive integer decreased by the minimum of a times the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 2, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise no change occurs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of f has been decreased by the minimum of the product of a and the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, and b. All other variables remain unchanged. The value of possible is still False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise it remains unchanged.
