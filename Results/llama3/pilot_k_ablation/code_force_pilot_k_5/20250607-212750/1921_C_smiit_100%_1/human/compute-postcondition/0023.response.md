Postcondition: ***t is at least 1, n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is 4, time_diff is the difference between the i-th and (i-1)th elements of arr, energy_keep_on is the product of a and time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on. If f is less than or equal to energy_cost, f is a positive integer decreased by energy_cost and possible is False. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
