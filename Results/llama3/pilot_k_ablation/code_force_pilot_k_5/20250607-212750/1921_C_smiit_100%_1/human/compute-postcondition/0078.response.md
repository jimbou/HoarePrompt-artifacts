Output State: **n is a positive integer greater than 2, f is a non-negative integer and is decreased by the minimum of a * (arr[2] - arr[1]) and b, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[2] - arr[1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[2] - arr[1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[2] - arr[1]) and b, t must be greater than 1, i is 2, and if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, then possible is False and 'NO' is printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `arr`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (arr[2] - arr[1])` and `b`, which is the same as the initial value of `energy_cost`. The values of `time_diff`, `energy_keep_on`, `energy_turn_off_on`, and `energy_cost` are updated based on the new values of `i` and `arr`. If `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, then `possible` is `False` and `'NO'` is printed.
