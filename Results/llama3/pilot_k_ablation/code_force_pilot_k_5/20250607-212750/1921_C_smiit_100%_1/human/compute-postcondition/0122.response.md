Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i-1`, `f` is a non-negative integer decreased by `energy_cost`, `a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1`, `m_2`, ..., `m_n`, `i` is increased by 2, `time_diff` is the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, `possible` is False if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `f` has been decreased by the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, which are calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. If `f` is less than or equal to the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, then `possible` is set to False, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged.
