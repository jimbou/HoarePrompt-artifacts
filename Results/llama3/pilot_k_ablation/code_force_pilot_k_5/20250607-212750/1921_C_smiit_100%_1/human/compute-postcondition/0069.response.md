Output State: **n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer equal to the maximum of 0 and f minus the sum of the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, possible is False, _ is 2, i is 1, time_diff is a positive integer equal to arr[i] - arr[i-1], energy_keep_on is a positive integer equal to a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]), energy_turn_off_on is a positive integer equal to b, energy_cost is a positive integer equal to the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b, and 'NO' is printed, t must be greater than 1. The current value of f is less than or equal to energy_cost.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`, effectively setting it to `False`. The second line, `break`, is a control flow statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the output state.

Therefore, the only change in the output state is that the variable `possible` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
