Output State: **t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer decreased by the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, a is a positive integer, b is a positive integer, arr is a list of n+1 integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are m_1, m_2, ..., m_n, i is n+1, time_diff is the difference between the last and second last elements of arr, energy_keep_on is a times time_diff, energy_turn_off_on is b, energy_cost is the minimum of energy_keep_on and energy_turn_off_on, possible is False if f is less than or equal to energy_cost, otherwise possible is True if f is greater than the minimum of a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1]) and b for all i from 1 to n, otherwise possible is False, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of possible.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer, `n` remains a positive integer, `f` is decreased by the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, `a` and `b` remain positive integers, `arr` remains a list of `n+1` integers where the first element is 0 and the rest are `m_1, m_2, ..., m_n`, `i` is `n+1`, `time_diff` is the difference between the last and second last elements of `arr`, `energy_keep_on` is `a` times `time_diff`, `energy_turn_off_on` is `b`, `energy_cost` is the minimum of `energy_keep_on` and `energy_turn_off_on`, and `possible` is `False` if `f` is less than or equal to `energy_cost`, otherwise `possible` is `True` if `f` is greater than the minimum of `a * (arr[i] - arr[i-1])` and `b` for all `i` from 1 to `n`, otherwise `possible` is `False`. Finally, either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on the value of `possible`.
