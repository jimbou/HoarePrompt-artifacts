This function performs a binary search on a tree data structure with n vertices to find a specific value. It takes a tree, the number of vertices n, and a non-negative integer k as input. The function iteratively narrows down the search range until it finds the desired value, which is returned as the result. The function assumes that the tree is valid and that n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, and k is a non-negative integer less than n. The function returns the index of the found value, which is the same as the end and mid values after the search is complete.
