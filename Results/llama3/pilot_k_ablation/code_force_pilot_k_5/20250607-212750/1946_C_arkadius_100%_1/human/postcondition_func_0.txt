Functionality: This function analyzes a tree data structure and calculates the number of connected components and the remaining size of the tree, given a minimum size requirement for each component. It takes as input a tree object, a starting vertex, and a minimum size threshold. The function traverses the tree, identifying connected components that meet the minimum size requirement and calculating the remaining size of the tree. It returns a tuple containing the total number of good components and the remaining size of the tree, both relative to the starting vertex.
