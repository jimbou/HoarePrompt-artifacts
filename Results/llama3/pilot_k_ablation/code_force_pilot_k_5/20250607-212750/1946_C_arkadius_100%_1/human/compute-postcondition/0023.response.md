To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the states of `beg` and `end` so that `beg` is still less than `end`.

According to the code, if `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, then `beg` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. This means that `beg` has been updated to be the midpoint of the previous range `[beg, end]`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `end` must be greater than the new value of `beg`.

If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is False, then `end` is equal to `mid - 1`. This means that `end` has been updated to be one less than the midpoint of the previous range `[beg, end]`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `beg` must be less than the new value of `end`.

In both cases, we need to ensure that the range `[beg, end]` is not empty, i.e., `beg` is less than `end`.

State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False, and `beg` is less than `end`.**
