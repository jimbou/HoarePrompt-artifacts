Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, `u` is the next unprocessed child of `v` in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`**.

In this output state, the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated by adding the value of `remaining_size[u]` to it, while the other variables remain unchanged. The value of `good_components[v]` is still increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, and `u` is still the next unprocessed child of `v` in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`. The list `tree.vertices[v].children` and the value of `v` remain unchanged.
