Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least one child, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, and an additional 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, and the remaining size of the first child u is added to this sum if it is less than x.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least two children, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, and an additional 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x, plus good_components[u] for the second child u of v, plus 1 if the remaining size of the second child u is greater than or equal to x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, and the remaining size of the first child u is added to this sum if it is less than x, u is the second child in the list, and the remaining size of the second child u is added to the remaining size of v if it is less than x.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least two children, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, and an additional 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x, plus good_components[u] for the second child u of v, and an additional 1 if the remaining size of the second child u is greater than or equal to x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, and the remaining size of the first child u is added to this sum if it is less than x, u is the second child in the list, and the remaining size of the second child u is added to the remaining size of v if it is less than x, u is the second child in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least one child, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, and an additional 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x, plus good_components[u] for the second child u of v, plus 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, and the remaining size of the first child u is added to this sum if it is less than x, u is the first child in the list, and the remaining size of v is increased by the remaining size of u if the remaining size of u is less than x.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least two children, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, and an additional 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x, plus good_components[u] for the second child u of v, plus 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x, plus good_components[u] for the second child u of v, plus 1. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, and the remaining size of the first child u is added to this sum if it is less than x, u is the first child in the list, and the remaining size of v is increased by the remaining size of u if the remaining size of u is less than x, and u is the next child of v. If the remaining size of u is greater than or equal to x, the remaining size of v is increased by the remaining size of u. Otherwise, the remaining size of v is increased by the remaining size of u and the remaining size of u is added to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
