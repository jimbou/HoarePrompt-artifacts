Postcondition: ***`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, then `beg` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `end` is equal to `mid - 1`.***
