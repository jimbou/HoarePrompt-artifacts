Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `v` is the last vertex popped from the stack, the current value of `postorder` is True, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` with `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children` with `remaining_size[u] < x`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `good_components[v]` has been incremented by the value of `good_components[u]`. Additionally, the remaining size of the first child `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children` is less than `x`, and `remaining_size[v]` is now equal to `remaining_size[v] + remaining_size[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the remaining size of the vertex `v` has been updated to include the remaining size of its first child `u`. The remaining size of `v` is now the sum of its previous remaining size and the remaining size of `u`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
