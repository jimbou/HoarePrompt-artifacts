Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.**

In this output state, the stack has been updated by popping the last vertex v and its corresponding boolean value postorder. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The vertex v and its boolean value postorder are now assigned to the variables v and postorder, respectively. The stack now contains one less tuple, but still contains at least one tuple for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children. The good_components and remaining_size dictionaries remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the pop operation.
