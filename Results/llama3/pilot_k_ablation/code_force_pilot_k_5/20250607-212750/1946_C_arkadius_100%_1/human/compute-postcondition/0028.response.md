Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `beg` is equal to `end`, `mid` is equal to `beg` which is equal to `end`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the binary search has converged to a single point, where `beg` and `end` are equal, and `mid` is also equal to `beg` and `end`. This means that the loop has finished searching for the desired value, and the final state of the variables reflects this convergence.
