Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is an empty list, good_components is an empty dictionary, remaining_size is an empty dictionary, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s, and the current value of postorder is True
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by 1 if the size of the subtree rooted at `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `u`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` if the size of the subtree rooted at `u` is less than `x`, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of the vertex `v`, and the current value of `postorder` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of the vertex `v`, and the current value of `postorder` is True. If the size of the subtree rooted at `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the value of `good_components` for `v` is increased by 1 and the value of `remaining_size` for `v` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`. Otherwise, the value of `good_components` for `v` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]` and the value of `remaining_size` for `v` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 3 children, `u` is the fourth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 4 children, `u` is the fifth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1 and is equal to `good_components[v]` + `good_components[u]` + 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
