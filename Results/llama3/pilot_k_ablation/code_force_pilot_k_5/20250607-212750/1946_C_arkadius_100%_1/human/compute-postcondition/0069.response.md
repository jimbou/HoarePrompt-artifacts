Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value good_components[u], `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1 + remaining_size[u], `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of tree.vertices[v].children, the current value of postorder is True, and the remaining size of v is less than or equal to x.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the remaining size of its child `u`. The remaining size of `v` is now the sum of its previous value (which was 1) and the remaining size of `u`. The remaining size of `v` is still less than or equal to `x`, since the remaining size of `u` was less than `x` and the sum of two values less than `x` is still less than or equal to `x`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
