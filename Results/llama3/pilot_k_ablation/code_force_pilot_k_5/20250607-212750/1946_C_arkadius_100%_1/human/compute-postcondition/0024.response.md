Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and `beg` is less than `end`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure and the values of n and k remain unchanged. The value of mid is updated to be the average of beg and end, rounded up to the nearest integer. The function func_3 is still either True or False, and the relationship between beg and end remains the same, with beg being less than end.
