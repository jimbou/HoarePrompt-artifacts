Postcondition: ***The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If we are in the postorder traversal, the stack is empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has no children. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
