Postcondition: ***tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If postorder is True, then stack is an empty list, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
