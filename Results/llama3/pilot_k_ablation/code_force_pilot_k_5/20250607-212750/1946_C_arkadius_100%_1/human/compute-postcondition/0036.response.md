Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 3 children, `u` is the fourth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`**.

In this output state, the value of `good_components[v]` has been updated by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The `tree` object still has at least one child, `s` still represents the starting vertex, `x` still represents the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is still empty, `v` is still the starting vertex and parent of at least three children, `u` is still the fourth child of `v`, and `postorder` is still True.
