Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether we are in the postorder traversal or not, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.**

In this output state, the values of tree, s, and x remain the same as in the initial state. The stack is not empty, and v is the last vertex popped from the stack. The value of postorder is determined by the popped tuple from the stack. The values of good_components and remaining_size are updated based on the children of the vertex v.
