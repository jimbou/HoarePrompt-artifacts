Functionality: This function calculates and returns the number of good components and the remaining size of a tree, starting from a given vertex, where a good component is a connected sub-tree with a size greater than or equal to a specified minimum size. The function traverses the tree using a stack-based approach, accumulating the count of good components and the remaining size for each vertex. The final result is a tuple containing the total count of good components and the remaining size for the starting vertex.
