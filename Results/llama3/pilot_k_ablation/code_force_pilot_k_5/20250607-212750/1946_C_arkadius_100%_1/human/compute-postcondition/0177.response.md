Postcondition: ***`good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged. If `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`. If `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1 and `remaining_size[v]` remains unchanged.***
