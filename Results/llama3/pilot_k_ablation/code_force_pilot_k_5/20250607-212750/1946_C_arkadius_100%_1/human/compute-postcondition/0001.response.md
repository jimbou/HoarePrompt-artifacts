To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 1, since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n`. 

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes**
