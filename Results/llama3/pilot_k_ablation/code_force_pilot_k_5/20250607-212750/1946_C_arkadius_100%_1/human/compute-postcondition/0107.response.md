Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, u is the nth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains n-1 additional tuples (u, False).**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the tree remains unchanged, the starting vertex and minimum size of each connected component remain the same, the last vertex popped from the stack and the boolean value popped from the stack remain unchanged, the stack contains tuples for each child of the current vertex and additional tuples for each child, the good_components dictionary contains the sum of good_components for each child and the number of children with remaining_size greater than or equal to x, and the remaining_size dictionary contains the sum of remaining_size for each child with remaining_size less than x. The good_components and remaining_size for the current vertex remain 0 and 1, respectively. The number of children of the current vertex is at least n, where n is the number of iterations of the loop, and the stack contains n-1 additional tuples.
