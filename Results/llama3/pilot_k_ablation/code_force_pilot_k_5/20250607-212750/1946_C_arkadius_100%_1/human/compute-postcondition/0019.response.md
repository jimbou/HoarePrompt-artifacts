Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False**

In this output state, the value of `mid` has been updated to be the average of `beg` and `end`, rounded up to the nearest integer. The values of `tree`, `n`, `k`, and `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` remain unchanged.
