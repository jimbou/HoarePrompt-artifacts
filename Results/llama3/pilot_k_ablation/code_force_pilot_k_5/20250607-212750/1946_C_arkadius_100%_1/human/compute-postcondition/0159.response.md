Output State: **The value of `good_components[v]` is increased by 1, the value of `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, where `u` is the first child of `v`, and the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`.**

In natural language, this means that the value of `good_components[v]` has been incremented by 1, and its value is still related to the value of `good_components[u]`, where `u` is the first child of `v`. Additionally, the condition that `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x` remains unchanged.
