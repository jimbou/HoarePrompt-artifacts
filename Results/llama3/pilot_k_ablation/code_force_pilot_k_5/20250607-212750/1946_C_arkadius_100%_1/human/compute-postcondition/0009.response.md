The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`n` is greater than 5, `i` is 5, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes and four additional edges between nodes u-1 and v-1, stdin contains no input**
