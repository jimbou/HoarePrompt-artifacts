Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 3 children, `u` is the fourth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree remains unchanged, the starting vertex `s` and the minimum size of each connected component `x` are still the same. The stack is still empty. The vertex `v` is still the starting vertex and has at least 3 children. The vertex `u` is still the fourth child of `v`. The postorder traversal is still set to True. The only change is that the number of good components of vertex `v` has been incremented by 1.
