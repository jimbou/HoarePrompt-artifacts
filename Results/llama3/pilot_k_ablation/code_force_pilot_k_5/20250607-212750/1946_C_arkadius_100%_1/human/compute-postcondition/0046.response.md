Postcondition: ***tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is an empty list, good_components is a dictionary where the value of v is increased by 1 if the size of the subtree rooted at u is greater than or equal to x, otherwise the value of v is increased by the value of u, remaining_size is a dictionary where the value of v is increased by remaining_size[u] if the size of the subtree rooted at u is less than x, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s and is the parent of all children, u is the last child of the vertex v, and the current value of postorder is True. If postorder is False, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
