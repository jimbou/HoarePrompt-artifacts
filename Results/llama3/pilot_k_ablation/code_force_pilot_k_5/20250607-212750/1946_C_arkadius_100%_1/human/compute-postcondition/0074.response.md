Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children. If the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 2 * good_components[u] + 1, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1. Otherwise, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 2 * good_components[u], and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1 + remaining_size[u] + remaining_size[u]. `u` is the second child of `tree.vertices[v]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated to include the value of `remaining_size[u]`. This means that the size of the connected component represented by vertex `v` now includes the size of the connected component represented by vertex `u`. The other variables remain unchanged.
