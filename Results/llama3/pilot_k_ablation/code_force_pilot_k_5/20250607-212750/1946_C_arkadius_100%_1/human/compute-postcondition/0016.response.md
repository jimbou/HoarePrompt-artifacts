Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is either (`((n + 2) // 2 - 1) + n + 1) // 2` or `((1 + ((n + 2) // 2 - 1)) + 1) // 2`, If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, then `beg` is (`n` + 2) // 2 - 1 and `end` is `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `beg` is 1 and `end` is `mid - 1`.**

In this output state, the value of `end` has been updated to `mid - 1`, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions for `beg` and `end` are still dependent on the value of `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)`, but the value of `end` is now specifically set to `mid - 1`.
