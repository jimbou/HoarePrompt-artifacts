Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list tree.vertices[v].children, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `good_components[v]` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the size of the connected component rooted at vertex `v` has increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their original values and properties. The `tree` object, starting vertex `s`, minimum component size `x`, and the stack of tuples remain the same.
