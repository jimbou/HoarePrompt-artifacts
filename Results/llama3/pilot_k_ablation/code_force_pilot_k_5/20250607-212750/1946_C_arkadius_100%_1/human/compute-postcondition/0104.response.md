Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 4 children, u is the fourth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains three additional tuples (u, False)**

In this output state, the stack now contains three additional tuples (u, False) because the code appends another tuple (u, False) to the stack. The other variables remain unchanged.
