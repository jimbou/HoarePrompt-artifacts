Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `end` is equal to `mid - 1`, and `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure remains valid with n vertices, and n is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. The value of k remains a non-negative integer less than n. The value of mid is still the average of beg and end plus 1, divided by 2. The value of end has been updated to be one less than mid. The function func_3 is still either True or False, depending on the previous state.
