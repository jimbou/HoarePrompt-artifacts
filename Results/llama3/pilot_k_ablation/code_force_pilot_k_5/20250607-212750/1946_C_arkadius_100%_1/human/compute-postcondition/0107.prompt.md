Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, stack now contains an additional tuple (v, True), good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 1 child, u is the first child of tree.vertices[v].children

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 2 children, u is the second child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains an additional tuple (u, False).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 3 children, u is the third child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains two additional tuples (u, False)

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 4 children, u is the fourth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains three additional tuples (u, False)

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 5 children, u is the fifth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains four additional tuples (u, False)




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
