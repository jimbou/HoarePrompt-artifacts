Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: good_components[s] and remaining_size[s]. good_components[s] is the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[s].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x. remaining_size[s] is the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[s].children with remaining_size[u] < x.**
