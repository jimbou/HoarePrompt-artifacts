Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is an empty list, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether the vertex v has been visited in postorder or not, tree.vertices[v].children has no children, u is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the stack is empty, indicating that all vertices have been visited. The good_components and remaining_size dictionaries have been updated to reflect the sum of good_components and remaining_size of all children of each vertex. The postorder variable indicates whether the last vertex popped from the stack has been visited in postorder or not. The tree.vertices[v].children has no children, indicating that all children of the last vertex have been visited. The variable u is not defined, indicating that there are no more children to visit.
