The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k < n, `tree` is a Tree object with n nodes and two additional edges between nodes u-1 and v-1, u and v are integers, stdin contains no input**
