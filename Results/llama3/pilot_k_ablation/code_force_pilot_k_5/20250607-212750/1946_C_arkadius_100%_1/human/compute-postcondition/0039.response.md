Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 3 children, `u` is the fourth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.***
