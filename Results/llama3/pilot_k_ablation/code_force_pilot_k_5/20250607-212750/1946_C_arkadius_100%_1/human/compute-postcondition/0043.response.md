Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 4 children, `u` is the fifth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`**

In this output state, the values of `tree`, `s`, `x`, `stack`, `v`, `u`, and `postorder` remain unchanged. The value of `good_components[v]` is still increased by `good_components[u]`. Additionally, the value of `remaining_size[v]` is now increased by `remaining_size[u]`, indicating that the size of the connected component rooted at vertex `v` has been updated to include the size of the connected component rooted at vertex `u`.
