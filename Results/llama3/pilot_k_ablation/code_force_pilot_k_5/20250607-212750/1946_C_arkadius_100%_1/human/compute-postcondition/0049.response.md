Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s, and tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n-1 children, where n is the number of children of tree.vertices[v].children, u is the (n-1)th child of tree.vertices[v].children, postorder is a boolean value which is either True or False.**

In this output state, the stack has been updated by removing the last tuple (v, postorder) from it. The values of the other variables remain the same. The variable v now holds the value of the vertex that was previously at the top of the stack, and the variable postorder holds the boolean value that was associated with that vertex.
