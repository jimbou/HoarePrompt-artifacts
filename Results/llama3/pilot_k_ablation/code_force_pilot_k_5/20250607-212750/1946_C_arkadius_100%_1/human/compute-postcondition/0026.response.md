Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, `end` is equal to `mid - 1`, and `beg` is less than `end`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree data structure remains valid with n vertices, and n is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 3. The value of k remains a non-negative integer less than n. The function func_3 still holds its previous True or False value. The mid value is still the average of beg and end, but the end value has been updated to be one less than mid. The beg value remains less than the updated end value.
