Postcondition: ***`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is True, then `beg` is equal to `mid` which is less than `end`. If `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is False, then `end` is equal to `mid - 1`, and `beg` is less than `end`.***
