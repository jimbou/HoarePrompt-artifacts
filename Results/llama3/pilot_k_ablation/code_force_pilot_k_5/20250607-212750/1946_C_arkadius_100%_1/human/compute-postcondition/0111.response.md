Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `v` is the last vertex popped from the stack, the current value of `postorder` is True, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` with `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children` with `remaining_size[u] < x`, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least one child, `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v].children`, and `good_components[v]` has been incremented by the value of `good_components[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object, starting vertex, minimum size of each connected component, last vertex popped from the stack, and the current value of postorder remain unchanged. The stack still contains tuples for each child of the current vertex. The good_components dictionary has been updated by adding the value of good_components of the first child of the current vertex to the value of good_components of the current vertex. The remaining_size dictionary remains unchanged. The current vertex and its children remain the same.
