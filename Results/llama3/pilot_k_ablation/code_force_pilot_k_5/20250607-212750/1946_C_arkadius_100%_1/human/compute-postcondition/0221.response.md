Output State: **The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least one child, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, and an additional 1 if the remaining size of the first child u is greater than or equal to x, plus good_components[u] for the second child u of v, plus 1. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, and the remaining size of the first child u is added to this sum if it is less than x, u is the first child in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of good_components[v] has been incremented by 1. This means that the number of good components in the subtree rooted at vertex v has increased by 1. All other variables and data structures remain unchanged.
