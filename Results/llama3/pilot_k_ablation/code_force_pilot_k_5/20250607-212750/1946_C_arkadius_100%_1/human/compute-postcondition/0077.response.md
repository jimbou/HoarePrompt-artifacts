Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is another child of `v`, `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`.**

In this output state, the values of `tree`, `s`, `x`, `stack`, `u`, and `v` remain unchanged. However, the value of `good_components[v]` has been updated by adding the value of `good_components[u]` to it. This means that the number of good components in the subtree rooted at vertex `v` has been increased by the number of good components in the subtree rooted at vertex `u`.
