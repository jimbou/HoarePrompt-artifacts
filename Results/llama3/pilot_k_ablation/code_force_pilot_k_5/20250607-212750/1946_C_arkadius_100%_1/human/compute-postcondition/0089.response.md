Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list tree.vertices[v].children, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object and the starting vertex remain unchanged. The minimum size of each connected component is still a positive integer. The stack still contains tuples representing the vertices and their children. The good_components of vertex v is increased by the good_components of its child u. The remaining_size of vertex v is increased by the remaining_size of its child u.
