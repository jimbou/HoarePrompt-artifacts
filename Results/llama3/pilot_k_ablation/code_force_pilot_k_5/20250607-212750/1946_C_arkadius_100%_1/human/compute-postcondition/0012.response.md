Output State: **`n` is greater than `n-1`, `i` is `n-1`, `k` is an integer such that `1 <= k < n`, `tree` is a Tree object with `n` nodes and `n-1` additional edges between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, `u` is an integer, `v` is an integer, and the root of the tree has been set to node 0 with parent -1.**

In this output state, the `tree` object has been modified by calling the `root_tree_non_recursive` method, which sets the root of the tree to node 0 with parent -1. The other variables remain unchanged.
