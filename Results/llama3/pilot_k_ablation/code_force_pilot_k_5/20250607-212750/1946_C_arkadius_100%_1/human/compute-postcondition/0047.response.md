Postcondition: ***tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If postorder is False, then stack is a list containing the tuples (v, True) and (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s, and tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, where n is the number of children of tree.vertices[v].children, u is the nth child of tree.vertices[v].children. If postorder is True, then stack is an empty list, good_components is a dictionary where the value of v is increased by 1 if the size of the subtree rooted at u is greater than or equal to x, otherwise the value of v is increased by the value of u, remaining_size is a dictionary where the value of v is increased by remaining_size[u] if the size of the subtree rooted at u is less than x, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s and is the parent of all children, u is the last child of the vertex v.***
