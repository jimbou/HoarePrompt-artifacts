Output State: **The program returns a tuple containing two values: the total number of good components in the subtrees rooted at all children of tree.vertices[v] with size x, and the total size of the subtrees rooted at all children of tree.vertices[v] that have a size less than x. The first value, good_components, is the total number of good components in the subtrees rooted at all children of tree.vertices[v] with size x. The second value, remaining_size, is the total size of the subtrees rooted at all children of tree.vertices[v] that have a size less than x.**
