Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s, and tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n-1 children, where n is the number of children of tree.vertices[v].children, u is the (n-1)th child of tree.vertices[v].children. The current value of postorder is True
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    good_components[v] += good_components[u]
    if remaining_size[u] >= x:
        good_components[v] += 1
    else:
        remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children. If the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value good_components[u] + 1, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1. Otherwise, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value good_components[u], and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1 + remaining_size[u].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children. If the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 2 * good_components[u] + 1, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1. Otherwise, if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, then `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 2 * good_components[u] + 1, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1 + remaining_size[u].

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is another child of `v`. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list tree.vertices[v].children. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list tree.vertices[v].children. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
