Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and the first child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 0, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of tree.vertices[v].children, and `postorder` is a boolean value which is either True or False.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object, the starting vertex, the minimum size of each connected component, the dictionary of good components, the dictionary of remaining size, and the postorder boolean value remain unchanged. The stack now contains the first child of the current vertex with a boolean value False, in addition to its previous contents.
