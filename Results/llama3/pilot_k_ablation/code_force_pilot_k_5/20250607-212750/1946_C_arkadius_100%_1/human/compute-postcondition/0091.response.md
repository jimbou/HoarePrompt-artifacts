Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` with `remaining_size[u] >= x`, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children` with `remaining_size[u] < x`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the `good_components` dictionary will contain the total number of good components in the subtree rooted at vertex `v`, where a good component is a connected component with size greater than or equal to `x`. The `remaining_size` dictionary will contain the total size of the remaining components in the subtree rooted at vertex `v`, which are the components with size less than `x`. The `stack` will be empty, indicating that all children of `v` have been processed. The `tree`, `s`, and `x` variables remain unchanged.
