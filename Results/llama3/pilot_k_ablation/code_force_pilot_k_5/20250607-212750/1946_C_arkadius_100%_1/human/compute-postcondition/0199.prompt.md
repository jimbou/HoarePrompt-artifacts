Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty and contains the tuple (v, True) in addition to its previous elements, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether we are in the postorder traversal or not, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack contains the tuple (u, False) in addition to its previous elements which includes the tuple (v, True), v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether we are in the postorder traversal or not, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least 1 child, u is the first child in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack contains the tuple (u, False) in addition to its previous elements which includes the tuple (v, True), v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether we are in the postorder traversal or not, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least 2 children, u is the second child in the list, and the stack now contains the tuple (u, False) as its top element.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack contains the tuple (u, False) in addition to its previous elements which includes the tuple (v, True), v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether we are in the postorder traversal or not, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least 3 children, u is the third child in the list, and the stack now contains the tuple (u, False) as its top element, and the stack now contains another tuple (u, False) as its top element.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack contains the tuple (u, False) twice in addition to its previous elements which includes the tuple (v, True), v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether we are in the postorder traversal or not, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have at least 4 children, u is the fourth child in the list, and the stack now contains the tuple (u, False) as its top element twice.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` contains the tuple `(u, False)` three times in addition to its previous elements which includes the tuple `(v, True)`, `v` is the last vertex popped from the stack, `postorder` is a boolean value indicating whether we are in the postorder traversal or not, `good_components` is a dictionary with key `v` and value 0, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key `v` and value 1, `tree.vertices[v].children` is a list of children that must have at least 5 children, `u` is the fifth child in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
