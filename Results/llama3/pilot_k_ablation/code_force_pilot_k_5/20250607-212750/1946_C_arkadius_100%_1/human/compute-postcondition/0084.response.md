Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list tree.vertices[v].children, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_size[v]` has been updated by adding the value of `remaining_size[u]` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The stack still contains tuples representing the children of each vertex, and the good_components array still stores the cumulative sum of good components for each vertex. The tree object and the starting vertex `s` also remain the same.
