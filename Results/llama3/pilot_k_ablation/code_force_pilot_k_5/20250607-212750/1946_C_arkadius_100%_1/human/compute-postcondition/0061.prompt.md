Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s, and tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n-1 children, where n is the number of children of tree.vertices[v].children, u is the (n-1)th child of tree.vertices[v].children, postorder is a boolean value which is either True or False.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and the first child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 0, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of tree.vertices[v].children, and `postorder` is a boolean value which is either True or False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and the first child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, and the second child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 0, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 2 children, `u` is the second child of tree.vertices[v].children, and `postorder` is a boolean value which is either True or False

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and the first child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the second child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, and the third child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 0, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 3 children, `u` is the third child of tree.vertices[v].children, and `postorder` is a boolean value which is either True or False

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and the first child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the second child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the third child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the fourth child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, and the fourth child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 0, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 4 children, `u` is the fourth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and `postorder` is a boolean value which is either True or False

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and the first child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the second child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the third child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the fourth child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, the fifth child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, and the fifth child u of tree.vertices[v].children is appended to the stack with a boolean value False, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value 0, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 5 children, `u` is the fifth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and `postorder` is a boolean value which is either True or False




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
