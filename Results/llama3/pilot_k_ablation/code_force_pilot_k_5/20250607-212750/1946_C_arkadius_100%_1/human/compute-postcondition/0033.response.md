Functionality: This function calculates and returns the total number of "good components" and the total size of subtrees with a size less than a given threshold 'x' in the subtrees rooted at all children of a given vertex 'v' in a tree. A "good component" is a subtree with a size equal to 'x'. The function recursively traverses the subtrees rooted at the children of 'v', counting the number of good components and the total size of subtrees with a size less than 'x'. The function returns a tuple containing these two values.
