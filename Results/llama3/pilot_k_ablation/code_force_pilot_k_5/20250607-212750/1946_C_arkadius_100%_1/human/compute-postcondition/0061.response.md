Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and all children u of tree.vertices[v].children are appended to the stack with a boolean value False, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, where n is the number of children of tree.vertices[v].children, u is the nth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and postorder is a boolean value which is either True or False.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the stack contains tuples for all children of the starting vertex, with each child appended with a boolean value of False. The number of children of the starting vertex is equal to the number of iterations of the loop. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
