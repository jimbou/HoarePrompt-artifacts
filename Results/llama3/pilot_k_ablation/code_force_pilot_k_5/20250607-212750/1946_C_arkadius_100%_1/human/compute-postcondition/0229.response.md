Output State: **The tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has no children, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all iterations, and the tree has been fully traversed in postorder. The stack is empty, indicating that all vertices have been popped from the stack. The good_components dictionary now contains the total number of good components for each vertex, which is the sum of the good components of its children plus the number of children with a remaining size greater than or equal to x. The remaining_size dictionary now contains the total remaining size for each vertex, which is the sum of the remaining sizes of its children with a remaining size less than x.
