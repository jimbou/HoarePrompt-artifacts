Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, otherwise it remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of good components at vertex `v` is increased by the number of good components at vertex `u`, where `u` is the next child of `v` in the list of children of `v`. The list of children of `v` and the value of `v` itself remain unchanged. The remaining size at vertex `v` is increased by the remaining size at vertex `u` if the remaining size at `u` is less than `x`, otherwise it remains the same.
