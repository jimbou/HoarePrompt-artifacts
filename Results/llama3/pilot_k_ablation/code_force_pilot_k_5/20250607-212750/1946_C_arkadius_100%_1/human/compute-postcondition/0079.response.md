Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is another child of `v`, `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object, starting vertex, minimum size of each connected component, and stack remain unchanged. The value of `good_components[v]` is still increased by the value of `good_components[u]`. Additionally, the value of `remaining_size[v]` is now increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.
