Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and stack is not empty, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x. v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is a boolean value indicating whether the vertex v has been visited in postorder or not. If postorder is False, then good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, u is the nth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains n-1 additional tuples (u, False). If postorder is True, then the value of good_components[v] has been increased by the value of good_components[u] for each child u of v in the iteration, and the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u] for each child u of v in the iteration where remaining_size[u] < x.
Code of the loop:
for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
    stack.append((u, False))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
