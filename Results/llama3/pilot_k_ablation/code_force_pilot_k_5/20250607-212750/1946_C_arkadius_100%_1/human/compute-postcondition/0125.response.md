Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `v` is the last vertex popped from the stack, `postorder` is True, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` with `remaining_size[u] >= x`, plus the value of `good_components[u]` for the first child `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children` whose remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`, and `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children` with `remaining_size[u] < x`, plus `remaining_size[u]` for the vertex `u` whose remaining size is added to `remaining_size[v]`. If `remaining_size[u] >= x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`. The value of `good_components[v]` has been increased by the value of `good_components[u]`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object, starting vertex, minimum size of each connected component, last vertex popped from the stack, and postorder flag remain unchanged. The stack still contains tuples representing the children of the current vertex. The good_components dictionary has been updated to include the sum of good_components for all children, the number of children with remaining size greater than or equal to x, and the good_components value for the first child with remaining size greater than or equal to x. The remaining_size dictionary has been updated to include the sum of remaining_size for all children with remaining size less than x, plus the remaining_size of the vertex whose remaining size was added to the current vertex's remaining size. If the remaining size of a child is greater than or equal to x, the good_components value for the current vertex is increased by 1. Otherwise, the remaining_size of the current vertex is increased by the remaining_size of the child.
