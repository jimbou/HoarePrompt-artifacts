Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 4 children, `u` is the fifth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True, `good_components[v]` is increased by `good_components[u]`**.

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object remains unchanged, the starting vertex `s` and the minimum size of each connected component `x` are still the same, the stack is still empty, and the vertex `v` is still the parent of at least 4 children. The fifth child of vertex `v` is still `u`. The postorder traversal is still True. The only change is that the number of good components of vertex `v` is increased by the number of good components of its fifth child `u`.
