Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value good_components[u], `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value 1, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex s, `tree.vertices[v].children` must have at least 1 child, `u` is the first child of tree.vertices[v].children, and the current value of postorder is True**

In this output state, the value of `good_components[v]` has been updated to include the value of `good_components[u]`, where `u` is the first child of `tree.vertices[v].children`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
