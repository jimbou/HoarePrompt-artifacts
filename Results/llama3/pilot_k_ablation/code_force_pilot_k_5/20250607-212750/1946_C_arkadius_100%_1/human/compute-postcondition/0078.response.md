Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is another child of `v`, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `good_components[v]` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the size of the connected component rooted at vertex `v` has increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `tree` still being a Tree object, `s` still representing the starting vertex, `x` still representing the minimum size of each connected component, and `stack` still containing tuples representing the children of each vertex. The relationship between `u` and `v` also remains the same, with `u` being another child of `v`.
