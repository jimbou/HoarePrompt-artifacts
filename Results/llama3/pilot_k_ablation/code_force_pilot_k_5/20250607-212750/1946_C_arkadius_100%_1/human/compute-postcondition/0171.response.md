Output State: **`good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, `u` is the next child of `v` in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`.**

In this output state, the value of `remaining_size[v]` is updated to be the sum of its previous value and `remaining_size[u]`, regardless of whether `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x` or not. The other variables remain unchanged.
