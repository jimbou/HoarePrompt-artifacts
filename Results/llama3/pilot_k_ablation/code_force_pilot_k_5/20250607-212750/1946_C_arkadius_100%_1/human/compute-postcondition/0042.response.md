Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object that must have at least 1 child, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of at least 4 children, `u` is the fifth child of the vertex `v`, `postorder` is True, `good_components[v]` is increased by 1, `good_components[v]` is equal to `good_components[v]` + 1, `good_components[v]` is equal to `good_components[v]` + `good_components[u]` + 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree remains the same with at least one child, the starting vertex `s` and the minimum size of each connected component `x` are unchanged, the stack is still empty, vertex `v` is still the starting vertex and has at least 4 children, vertex `u` is still the fifth child of vertex `v`, the postorder traversal is still True, and the value of `good_components[v]` has been incremented by 1, making it equal to its original value plus 1, which is also equal to its original value plus the value of `good_components[u]` plus 1.
