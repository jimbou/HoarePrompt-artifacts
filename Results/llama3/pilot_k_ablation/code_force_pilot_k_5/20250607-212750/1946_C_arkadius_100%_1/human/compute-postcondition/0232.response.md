Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is an empty list, good_components is a dictionary where the value of each key v is equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary where the value of each key v is equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a state where the stack is empty, indicating that all vertices in the tree have been processed. The good_components dictionary contains the total number of good components for each vertex, which is the sum of the good components of its children plus the number of children with a size greater than or equal to x. The remaining_size dictionary contains the total remaining size for each vertex, which is the sum of the remaining sizes of its children with a size less than x. The tree, starting vertex, and minimum size remain unchanged.
