Postcondition: ***tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If we are not in the postorder traversal, stack contains the tuple (u, False) n times in addition to its previous elements which includes the tuple (v, True), v is the last vertex popped from the stack, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have n children, u is the nth child in the list. If we are in the postorder traversal, the stack is empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has no children. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.***
