Postcondition: ***The value of `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]`, where `u` is the first child of `v`. If the current value of `remaining_size[u]` is greater than or equal to `x`, then the value of `good_components[v]` is also increased by 1. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.***
