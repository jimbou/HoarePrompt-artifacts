Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least one child, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, plus remaining_size[u] for the first child u of v, and the remaining size of u is less than x, u is the first child of v**

In this output state, the value of remaining_size[v] has been updated to include the remaining size of its first child u. The remaining size of v is now the sum of the remaining sizes of all its children with remaining sizes less than x, plus the remaining size of its first child u. The other variables remain unchanged.
