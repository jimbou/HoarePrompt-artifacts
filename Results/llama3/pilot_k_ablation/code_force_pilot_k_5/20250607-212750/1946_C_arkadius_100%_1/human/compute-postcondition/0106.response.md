Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, postorder is the boolean value popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and an additional tuple (u, False), good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, good_components[v] is 0, and remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least 5 children, u is the fifth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains four additional tuples (u, False)**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree object, starting vertex s, minimum size x, last vertex v, and boolean value postorder remain unchanged. The stack now contains an additional tuple (u, False), where u is the fifth child of tree.vertices[v].children, making a total of four additional tuples (u, False) in the stack. The good_components and remaining_size dictionaries also remain unchanged, with good_components[v] still being 0 and remaining_size[v] still being 1.
