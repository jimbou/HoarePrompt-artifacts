Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and stack is not empty and now contains an additional tuple (u, False), `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, `v` is the last vertex popped from the stack, `postorder` is a boolean value indicating whether the vertex v has been visited in postorder or not, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least one child, `u` will take on the value of each child of tree.vertices[v].children during the iteration.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with an additional tuple (u, False) appended to the stack, where u is a child of the current vertex v. All other variables remain unchanged.
