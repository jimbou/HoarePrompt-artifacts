Output State: **`tree` is a valid tree data structure with `n` vertices, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `k` < `n`, `func_3(tree, n, k, mid)` is still True or False, `mid` is equal to `(beg + end + 1) // 2`, and `beg` is equal to `mid` which is less than `end`.**

In this output state, the value of `beg` has been updated to be equal to `mid`, which is still less than `end`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
