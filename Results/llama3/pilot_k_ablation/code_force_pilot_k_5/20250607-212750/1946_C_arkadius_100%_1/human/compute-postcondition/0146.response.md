Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and stack is not empty and now contains an additional tuple (u, False), `good_components` is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, `remaining_size` is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, `v` is the last vertex popped from the stack, `postorder` is a boolean value indicating whether the vertex v has been visited in postorder or not, `tree.vertices[v].children` has at least two children, `u` is the second child of tree.vertices[v].children and stack now contains an additional tuple (u, False)**

In natural language, the output state is: The tree, starting vertex, minimum size, good components, remaining size, last vertex popped from the stack, postorder status, and the children of the last vertex popped from the stack remain the same. The stack now contains an additional tuple (u, False), where u is the second child of the last vertex popped from the stack.
