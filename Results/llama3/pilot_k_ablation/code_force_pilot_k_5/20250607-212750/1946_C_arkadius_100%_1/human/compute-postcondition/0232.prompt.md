Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is a list containing a tuple with s as the first element and False as the second element, good_components is an empty dictionary, and remaining_size is an empty dictionary.
Code of the loop:
while stack:
    v, postorder = stack.pop()
    if not postorder:
        stack.append((v, True))
        good_components[v] = 0
        remaining_size[v] = 1
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            stack.append((u, False))
    elif postorder:
        for u in tree.vertices[v].children:
            good_components[v] += good_components[u]
            if remaining_size[u] >= x:
                good_components[v] += 1
            else:
                remaining_size[v] += remaining_size[u]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If postorder is False, then stack is a list containing the tuples (v, True) and (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s, and tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, where n is the number of children of tree.vertices[v].children, u is the nth child of tree.vertices[v].children. If postorder is True, then stack is an empty list, good_components is a dictionary where the value of v is increased by 1 if the size of the subtree rooted at u is greater than or equal to x, otherwise the value of v is increased by the value of u, remaining_size is a dictionary where the value of v is increased by remaining_size[u] if the size of the subtree rooted at u is less than x, v is an integer representing the starting vertex s and is the parent of all children, u is the last child of the vertex v.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: *tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If postorder is False, then stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and all children u of tree.vertices[v].children are appended to the stack with a boolean value False. If postorder is True, then stack is an empty list, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x. If postorder is False, then good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, u is the nth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains n-1 additional tuples (u, False). If postorder is True, then the value of good_components[v] has been increased by the value of good_components[u] for each child u of v in the iteration, and the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u] for each child u of v in the iteration where remaining_size[u] < x.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: *tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If postorder is False, then stack is an empty list, tree.vertices[v].children has no children, and u is not defined. If postorder is True, then stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children and stack is not empty. good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x. remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x. v is the last vertex popped from the stack. If postorder is True, then the final values of `good_components[v]` and `remaining_size[v]` are determined after processing all children of `v`. `good_components[v]` is the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `v`, plus the number of children `u` with `remaining_size[u]` greater than or equal to `x`. `remaining_size[v]` is the sum of `remaining_size[u]` for all children `u` of `v` with `remaining_size[u]` less than `x`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: *tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component. If we are not in the postorder traversal, stack contains the tuple (u, False) n times in addition to its previous elements which includes the tuple (v, True), v is the last vertex popped from the stack, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value 0, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value 1, tree.vertices[v].children is a list of children that must have n children, u is the nth child in the list. If we are in the postorder traversal, the stack is empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has no children. The good_components dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x. The remaining_size dictionary has key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
