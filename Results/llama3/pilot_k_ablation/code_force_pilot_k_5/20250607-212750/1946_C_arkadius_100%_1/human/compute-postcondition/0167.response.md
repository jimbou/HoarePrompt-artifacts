Postcondition: ***`good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]` if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, otherwise `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. In both cases, `u` remains the next child of `v`, `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged, and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, otherwise it remains unchanged.***
