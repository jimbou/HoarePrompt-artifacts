The only variable in the loop head is variable `u`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `u`. If `u` is in `tree.vertices[v].children`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `u` is one of the children of `v`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `u` must be another child of `v`. 
State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is another child of `v`.**
