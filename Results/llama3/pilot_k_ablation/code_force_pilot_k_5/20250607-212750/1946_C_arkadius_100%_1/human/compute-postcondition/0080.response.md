Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, `u` is another child of `v`. If the remaining size of `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]` and `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.***
