Postcondition: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, stack is not empty, v is the last vertex popped from the stack and has at least one child, postorder is true, indicating we are in the postorder traversal, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, plus good_components[u] for the first child u of v, remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x, u is the first child of v. The current value of remaining_size[u] is greater than or equal to x.**
