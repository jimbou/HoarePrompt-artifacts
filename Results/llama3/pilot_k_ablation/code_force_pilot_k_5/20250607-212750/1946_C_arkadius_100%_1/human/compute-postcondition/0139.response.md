Postcondition: ***tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x. If postorder is False, then good_components[v] is 0, remaining_size[v] is 1, tree.vertices[v].children must have at least n children, u is the nth child of tree.vertices[v].children, and stack now contains n-1 additional tuples (u, False). If postorder is True, then the value of good_components[v] has been increased by the value of good_components[u] for each child u of v in the iteration, and the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u] for each child u of v in the iteration where remaining_size[u] < x.***
