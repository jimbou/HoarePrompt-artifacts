Output State: **`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `stack` is an empty list, `good_components` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by 1 if the size of the subtree rooted at `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `u`, `remaining_size` is a dictionary where the value of `v` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` if the size of the subtree rooted at `u` is less than `x`, `v` is an integer representing the starting vertex `s` and is the parent of all children, `u` is the last child of the vertex `v`, and the current value of `postorder` is True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the `tree` object remains unchanged, the starting vertex `s` and the minimum size `x` remain the same, the stack is still empty, and the `postorder` value is still True. The `good_components` dictionary is updated such that the value of `v` is increased by 1 if the size of the subtree rooted at `u` is greater than or equal to `x`, otherwise the value of `v` is increased by the value of `u`. The `remaining_size` dictionary is updated such that the value of `v` is increased by `remaining_size[u]` if the size of the subtree rooted at `u` is less than `x`. The vertex `v` is now the parent of all its children, and `u` is the last child of the vertex `v`.
