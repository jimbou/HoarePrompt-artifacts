Output State: **tree is a Tree object, s is an integer representing the starting vertex, x is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, v is the last vertex popped from the stack, the current value of postorder is True, stack is a list containing at least one tuple (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of tree.vertices[v].children, good_components is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of good_components[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children, plus the number of children u with remaining_size[u] >= x, and remaining_size is a dictionary with key v and value equal to the sum of remaining_size[u] for all children u of tree.vertices[v].children with remaining_size[u] < x. The value of good_components[v] has been increased by the value of good_components[u] for each child u of v in the iteration, and the value of remaining_size[v] has been increased by remaining_size[u] for each child u of v in the iteration where remaining_size[u] < x.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the tree, starting vertex, minimum size of each connected component, and postorder value remain unchanged. The stack contains tuples for each child of the current vertex, and the good_components dictionary has been updated to include the sum of good_components for all children of the current vertex, plus the number of children with a remaining size greater than or equal to the minimum size. The remaining_size dictionary has been updated to include the sum of remaining sizes for all children with a remaining size less than the minimum size. The good_components value for the current vertex has been increased by the good_components value for each child, and the remaining_size value for the current vertex has been increased by the remaining_size value for each child where the remaining size is less than the minimum size.
