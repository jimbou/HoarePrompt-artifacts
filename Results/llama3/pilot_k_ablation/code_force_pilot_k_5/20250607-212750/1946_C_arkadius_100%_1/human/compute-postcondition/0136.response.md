Postcondition: ***`tree` is a Tree object, `s` is an integer representing the starting vertex, `x` is a positive integer representing the minimum size of each connected component, `v` is the last vertex popped from the stack, `postorder` is True, `stack` is a list containing at least two tuples (v, True) or (u, False) for each child u of `tree.vertices[v].children`, `good_components` is a dictionary with key `v` and value equal to the sum of `good_components[u]` for all children `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children`, plus the number of children `u` with `remaining_size[u] >= x`, plus the value of `good_components[u]` for the first child `u` of `tree.vertices[v].children` whose remaining size is greater than or equal to `x`. If `remaining_size[u] >= x`, then `good_components[v]` is increased by 1 and `remaining_size[v]` is not changed. Otherwise, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by `remaining_size[u]`. The value of `good_components[v]` has been increased by the value of `good_components[u]` for the current child `u` of `v` in the iteration.***
