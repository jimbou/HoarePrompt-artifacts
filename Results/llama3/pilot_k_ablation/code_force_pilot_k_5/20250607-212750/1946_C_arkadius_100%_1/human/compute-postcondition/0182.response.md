Postcondition: ***`good_components[v]` is increased by the value of `good_components[u]` if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, otherwise it is increased by 1. `u` is the next unprocessed child of `v` in the list `tree.vertices[v].children`, `tree.vertices[v].children` remains unchanged, `v` remains unchanged. `remaining_size[v]` is updated according to the conditions in the previous iteration, and if `remaining_size[u]` is less than `x`, `remaining_size[v]` is increased by the value of `remaining_size[u]`.***
