Output State: **n is greater than 2, i is 2, k is an integer such that 1 <= k < n, tree is a Tree object with n nodes and two additional edges between nodes u-1 and v-1, u and v are integers, stdin contains no input**

In this final state, the values of `n`, `i`, and `k` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The `tree` object now has two additional edges between nodes `u-1` and `v-1`, where `u` and `v` are integers that were provided as input. The stdin is empty as it was before the code execution.
