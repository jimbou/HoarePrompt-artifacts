Reasoning: 

The given program is designed to solve a problem involving a tree data structure. The problem requires finding the maximum number x such that it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree in such a way that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x.

The program uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x. It starts by initializing two pointers, beg and end, to 1 and n, respectively. It then enters a loop where it calculates the mid value and checks if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least mid. If it is possible, it updates the beg pointer to mid. Otherwise, it updates the end pointer to mid - 1. The loop continues until beg is no longer less than end.

The program uses a helper function, func_3, to check if it is possible to remove exactly k edges from the tree such that the size of each remaining connected component is at least x. This function uses another helper function, func_1, to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges.

The program also uses a Tree class to represent the tree data structure. The Tree class has methods to add edges to the tree and to root the tree.

The program reads input from the user, which includes the number of vertices in the tree and the number of edges to be removed. It then creates a Tree object and adds edges to the tree based on the user input. Finally, it calls the func_4 function to find the maximum value of x and prints the result.

Based on the provided code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct. It uses a binary search approach to find the maximum value of x, which is efficient for large inputs. The helper functions, func_3 and func_1, are used to calculate the number of good components and the remaining size of the tree after removing edges, which is necessary for the binary search approach. The Tree class is used to represent the tree data structure, which is necessary for the problem.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
