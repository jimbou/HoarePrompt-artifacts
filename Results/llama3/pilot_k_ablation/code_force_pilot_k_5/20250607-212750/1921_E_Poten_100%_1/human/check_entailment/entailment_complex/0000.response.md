Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly determines the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips and the dimensions of the board. The program handles various scenarios, including cases where the players are in the same row or column, or where the distance between them is within a certain range.

The program uses a combination of conditional statements and arithmetic operations to determine the winner of the game. It checks if Alice or Bob can win by moving their chip to the opponent's position, or if the game will end in a draw if neither player can make a move.

The program also correctly handles the cases where the players are in the same row or column, or where the distance between them is within a certain range. It uses the modulo operator to check if the row or column indices of the players are even or odd, and uses arithmetic operations to calculate the distance between the players.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly produces the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
