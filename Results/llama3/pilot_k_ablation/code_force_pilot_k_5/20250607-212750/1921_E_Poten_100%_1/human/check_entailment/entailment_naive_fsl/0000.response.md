Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly determine the outcome of the game in all cases. One potential case where the program fails is when Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, but they are not in the same column. In this case, the program incorrectly outputs "Draw" instead of "Alice".

For example, if the input is:

10 10 10 5 1 3

The program outputs "Draw", but the correct output should be "Alice" because Alice can move her chip to the cell occupied by Bob's chip and win the game.

The program's logic is flawed because it only checks if Alice's chip is in the last row or if Bob's chip is in the first row, but it does not consider the case where they are in different columns. To fix this, the program needs to add additional logic to handle this case correctly.
