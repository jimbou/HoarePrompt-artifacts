The code appends the string 'Bob' to the list `answers`. The value of `answers` was a list containing two strings, so now it will be a list containing three strings. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case**
