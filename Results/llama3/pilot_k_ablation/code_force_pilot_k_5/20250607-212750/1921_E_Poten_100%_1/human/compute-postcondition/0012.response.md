Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Draw', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In this output state, the only change is that the `answers` list now contains one string 'Draw', which was appended by the code. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
