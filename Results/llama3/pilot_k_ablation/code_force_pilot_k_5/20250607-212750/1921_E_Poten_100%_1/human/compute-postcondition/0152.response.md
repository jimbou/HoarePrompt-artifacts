Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six.**

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` is a list containing two, three or four strings. After appending 'Draw', the list will contain three, four or five strings. The other variables are not affected by this code. The value of `test_cases` is still greater than 4, `clues` is still a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is still 4, and stdin still contains multiple test cases minus six.
