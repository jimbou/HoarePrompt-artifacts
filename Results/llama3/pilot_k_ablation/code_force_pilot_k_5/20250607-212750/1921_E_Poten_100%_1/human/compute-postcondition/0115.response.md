Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. The number of strings in `answers` depends on whether `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. If the condition is true, `answers` will have four strings; otherwise, it will have three strings.***
