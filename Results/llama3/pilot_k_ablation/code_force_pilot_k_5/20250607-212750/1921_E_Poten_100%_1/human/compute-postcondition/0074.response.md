Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, the first string is either 'Draw' or 'Bob' or 'Alice', the second string is either 'Draw' or 'Alice', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then the first element of `answers` is determined by the conditions stated in the if part. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` is determined by the conditions stated in the else part. If `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, then the second element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the second element of `answers` contains 'Alice'.**
