The code `answers.append('Alice')` appends the string 'Alice' to the end of the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` is a list containing two or three strings. After appending 'Alice', the list `answers` will contain three or four strings. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case.**
