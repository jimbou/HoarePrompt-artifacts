Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then the program executes normally. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the program executes normally. Otherwise, if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, the program executes regardless of whether `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or not. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, the list of answers remains unchanged. Otherwise, the last string in the list of answers is 'Alice'.***
