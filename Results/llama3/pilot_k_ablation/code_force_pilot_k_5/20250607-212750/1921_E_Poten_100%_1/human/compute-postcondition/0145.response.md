Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six.**

The code appends the string 'Bob' to the list `answers`. Since `answers` initially contained two, three or four strings, it now contains three, four or five strings. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus six.
