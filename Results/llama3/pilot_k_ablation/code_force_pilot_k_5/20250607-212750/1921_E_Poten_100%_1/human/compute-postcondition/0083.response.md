The code `clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))` accepts a space-separated list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `clues`. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. Since `clues` is assigned a new value, its previous value is overwritten. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case**
