Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing 'Bob', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. (clues[5] - 1 is less than or equal to abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2))**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The list of answers now contains the string 'Bob'. The number of test cases in the standard input is reduced by two. The value of `i` remains 0. The list of clues remains the same, with the third element being less than the fifth element, the first element not being 1, and the third and fifth elements having the same parity (both even or both odd). The third element of clues is not equal to the fifth element, and the difference between the fifth and third elements is within a certain range.
