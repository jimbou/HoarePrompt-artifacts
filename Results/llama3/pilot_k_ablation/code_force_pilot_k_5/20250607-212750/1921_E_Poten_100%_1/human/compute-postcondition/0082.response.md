The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and test_cases, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `test_cases`. If `i` is less than `test_cases`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `test_cases` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `test_cases` must be greater than 2.
State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case.**
