Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Alice', which means it now contains three, four or five strings. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still multiple test cases minus six.
