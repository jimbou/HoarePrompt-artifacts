Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing either the string 'Draw' or 'Alice', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The third element of `clues` is less than or equal to the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.***
