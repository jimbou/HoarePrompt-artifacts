Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case**

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The initial state of `answers` was a list containing two strings, so now it contains three strings. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `test_cases` is still greater than 2, `stdin` still contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is still 2, and `clues` is still a list of integers containing the next test case.
