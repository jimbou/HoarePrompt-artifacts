Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six, and 'Draw' has been appended to the `answers` list.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw', which was appended to the list. The other variables remain unchanged, with `test_cases` still greater than 4, `clues` still containing the next test case, `i` still equal to 4, and stdin still containing multiple test cases minus six.
