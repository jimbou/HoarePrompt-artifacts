Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing the string 'Alice', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are of different parity. The absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` is less than the current value of the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0, the list of answers now contains the string 'Alice', the standard input still contains multiple test cases minus two, the variable i remains 0, and the list of clues still has the same properties as before.
