Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is an empty list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers**.

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains greater than 0, and the list `answers` is still empty. The `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus two, as one test case has been read and processed. The value of `i` remains 0, as it has not been modified. The new variable `clues` is introduced, which is a list of integers obtained from the input.
