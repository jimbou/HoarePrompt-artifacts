Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five. Otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five***
