Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing two, three or four strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, then if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, the length of `answers` is not changed. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, the length of `answers` is determined by the condition `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`***
