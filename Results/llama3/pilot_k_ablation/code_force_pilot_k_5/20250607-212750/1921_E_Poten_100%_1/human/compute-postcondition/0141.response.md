Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six, and 'Draw' has been appended to the `answers` list.**

In this output state, the value of `test_cases` remains greater than 4, and the value of `i` remains 4. The `clues` list still contains the next test case. The `answers` list, which initially contained two, three, or four strings, now contains three, four, or five strings because 'Draw' has been appended to it. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus six.
