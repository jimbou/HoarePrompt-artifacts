Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing two or three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, `answers` contains three strings. Otherwise, `answers` contains two or three strings, depending on whether `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or not.***
