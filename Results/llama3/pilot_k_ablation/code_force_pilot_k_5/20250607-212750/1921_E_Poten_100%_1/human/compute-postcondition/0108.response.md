Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing two or three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing three strings. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains three strings. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, `answers` contains three strings. Otherwise, `answers` contains two or three strings, depending on whether `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or not. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, the program executes normally. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the program executes normally. Otherwise, if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, the program executes regardless of whether `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or not. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, the list of answers remains unchanged. Otherwise, the last string in the list of answers is 'Alice'.***
