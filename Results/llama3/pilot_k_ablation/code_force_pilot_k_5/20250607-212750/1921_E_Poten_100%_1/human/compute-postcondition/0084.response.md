The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`. The value of `answers` is updated, but the values of the other variables are not affected. The new value of `answers` is a list containing three strings: the two original strings and the newly appended 'Draw'.

Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case**
