Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]` and `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' has been appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the `answers` list.***
