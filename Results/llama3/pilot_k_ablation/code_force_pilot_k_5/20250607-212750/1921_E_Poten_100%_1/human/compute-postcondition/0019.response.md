Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Draw', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw', while the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on the elements of `clues` are still valid, and the values of `test_cases`, `stdin`, and `i` are unchanged.
