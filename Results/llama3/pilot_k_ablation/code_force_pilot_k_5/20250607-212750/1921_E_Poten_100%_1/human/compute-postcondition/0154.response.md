Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six. If `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers.***
