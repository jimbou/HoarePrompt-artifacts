Postcondition: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then if `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. The second element of `answers` is 'Bob'. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, the first element of `answers` is either 'Draw' or 'Alice' and the second element of `answers` is 'Bob' if `clues[5] - 1` is not greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` is either 'Draw' or 'Alice' and the second element of `answers` is 'Draw'. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then the first element of `answers` is either 'Draw' or 'Alice' and the second element of `answers` is 'Bob'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Draw' and 'Draw'.**
