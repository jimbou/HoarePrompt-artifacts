Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, then `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five. Otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five***
