Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, and the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The current value of the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. If the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
