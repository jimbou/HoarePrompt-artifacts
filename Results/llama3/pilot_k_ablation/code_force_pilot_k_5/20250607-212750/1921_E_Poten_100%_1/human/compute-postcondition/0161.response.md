Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing two, three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six. If `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers. Otherwise, the list of answers remains unchanged.***
