Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case.**

In this output state, the value of `answers` has been updated to include the string 'Draw' as its last element. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of strings in the `answers` list has increased by one, and it now contains either three or four strings. The rest of the variables retain their original values and properties.
