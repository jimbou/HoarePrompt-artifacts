Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six. The state of the program does not change based on the if condition, as both the if and else parts have the same postcondition.***
