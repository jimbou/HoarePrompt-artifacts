Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, the first string is either 'Draw' or 'Bob' or 'Alice', the second string is 'Alice', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is compared to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2. If the difference is greater, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is compared to the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. If the difference is greater, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. Otherwise, if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'.**

The code appends 'Alice' to the list `answers`, which now contains two strings. The first string is either 'Draw', 'Bob', or 'Alice' based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The second string is 'Alice'. The other variables remain unchanged.
