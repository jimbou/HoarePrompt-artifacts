Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, then `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five. The number of strings in `answers` depends on whether `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. If the condition is true, `answers` will have four strings; otherwise, it will have three strings. If `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, then if `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five. Otherwise, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five.***
