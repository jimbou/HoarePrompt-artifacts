Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing one string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is compared to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2. If the difference is greater, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is compared to the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. If the difference is greater, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. Otherwise, if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.**

In natural language, the output state is that the variable `clues` now contains a list of integers representing the next test case, and the rest of the variables remain unchanged. The `stdin` now contains multiple test cases minus three. The conditions for `answers` remain the same as before, but now they are applied to the new values in `clues`.
