Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string 'Bob', `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. The third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`. The current value of the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`. The difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is less than or equal to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases is still greater than 0. The list of answers now contains one string 'Bob'. The number of test cases in the standard input is reduced by two. The value of `i` remains 0. The list of clues remains the same, with the first element not equal to 1, the third and fifth elements having the same parity, the third element being greater than the fifth element, and the difference between the second and fifth elements being less than or equal to half the absolute difference between the third and fourth elements.
