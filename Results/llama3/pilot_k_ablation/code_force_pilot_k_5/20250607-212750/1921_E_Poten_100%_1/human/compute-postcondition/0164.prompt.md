Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: test_cases is an integer, answers is an empty list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each test case contains six space-separated integers: h, w, x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b. h and w are positive integers. x_a, y_a, x_b, y_b are positive integers such that 1 <= x_a, x_b <= h and 1 <= y_a, y_b <= w.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(test_cases):
    clues = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    if clues[2] > clues[4] or clues[0] == 1:
        answers.append('Draw')
    elif clues[2] % 2 == 0 and clues[4] % 2 == 0 or clues[2
        ] % 2 != 0 and clues[4] % 2 != 0:
        if clues[3] == clues[5]:
            answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
            if clues[5] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
        elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
            if clues[1] - clues[5] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
                answers.append('Draw')
            else:
                answers.append('Bob')
    elif clues[3] == clues[5]:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1:
        answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] < clues[5]:
        if clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')
    elif clues[3] > clues[5]:
        if clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2):
            answers.append('Draw')
        else:
            answers.append('Alice')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is compared to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2. If the difference is greater, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is compared to the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. If the difference is greater, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then `answers` contains 'Alice'. Otherwise, if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Alice'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `test_cases` is greater than 1, `answers` is a list containing two strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three, `i` is 1, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is 1, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is compared to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2. If the difference is greater, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is compared to the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. If the difference is greater, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are not both even or both odd, then if the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is 1, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. Otherwise, if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` is greater than the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, then if the difference between the third element of `clues` and 1 is greater than the absolute difference between the second element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues` divided by 2, then the first element of `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, the first element of `answers` contains 'Alice'. The second element of `answers` is 'Draw' if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)` and `abs(clues[3] - clues[5]) == 1`, otherwise it is 'Alice'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing two or three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing three strings. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` contains three strings. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, `answers` contains three strings. Otherwise, `answers` contains two or three strings, depending on whether `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or not. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, the program executes normally. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, the program executes normally. Otherwise, if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, the program executes regardless of whether `clues[1] - clues[3]` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2 or not. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, the list of answers remains unchanged. Otherwise, the last string in the list of answers is 'Alice'.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`test_cases` is greater than 3, `answers` is a list containing two, three or four strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus five, `i` is 3, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` is equal to 1, `answers` is a list containing three or four strings. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have the same parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` will have three or four strings depending on whether `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, `answers` will have three or four strings depending on the same condition. If `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, then if `clues[1] - clues[5]` is greater than the absolute value of the difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, `answers` will have three or four strings. Otherwise, `answers` will have three or four strings depending on whether `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` have different parity, then if `clues[3]` is equal to `clues[5]`, `answers` will have three or four strings. If `clues[3]` is not equal to `clues[5]`, then if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, `answers` will have three or four strings. If the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is not 1, then if `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, the length of `answers` is not changed. If `clues[3]` is greater than `clues[5]`, the length of `answers` is determined by the condition `clues[3] - 1 > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `test_cases` is greater than 4, `answers` is a list containing two, three, four or five strings, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus six. If `clues[2]` is greater than `clues[4]` or `clues[0]` equals 1, 'Draw' has been appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, if `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, no changes have been made to the `answers` list. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]` and `clues[5] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' has been appended to the `answers` list. Otherwise, no changes have been made to the `answers` list. If `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` are not both even or both odd, then if `clues[3]` equals `clues[5]`, `answers` is a list containing three, four or five strings. Otherwise, if the absolute difference between `clues[3]` and `clues[5]` is 1, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If `clues[3]` is less than `clues[5]`, then if `clues[1] - clues[3] > abs((clues[2] - clues[4]) // 2)`, the state of the program remains unchanged. Otherwise, 'Alice' has been appended to the list of answers. If `clues[3]` is greater than or equal to `clues[5]`, then if `clues[3] - 1` is greater than the absolute difference between `clues[2]` and `clues[4]` divided by 2, 'Draw' has been appended to the list of answers. Otherwise, the list of answers remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
