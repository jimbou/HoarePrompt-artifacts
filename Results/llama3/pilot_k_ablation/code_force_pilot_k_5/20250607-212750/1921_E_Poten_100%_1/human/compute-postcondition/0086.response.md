Output State: **`test_cases` is greater than 2, `answers` is a list containing three strings, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus four, `i` is 2, `clues` is a list of integers containing the next test case**

The code appends the string 'Draw' to the list `answers`, which initially contains two strings. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `test_cases` is still greater than 2, `i` is still 2, and `clues` still contains the next test case. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus four.
