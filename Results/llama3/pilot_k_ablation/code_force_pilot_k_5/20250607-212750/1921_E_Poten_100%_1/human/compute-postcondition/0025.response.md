Postcondition: ***`test_cases` is greater than 0, `answers` is a list containing one string, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two, `i` is 0, `clues` is a list of integers. The first element of `clues` is not equal to 1. The third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` are either both even or both odd. If the third element of `clues` is equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is not equal to the fifth element of `clues`, then if the third element of `clues` is less than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the fifth element of `clues` and 1 is compared to the absolute difference between the third element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` divided by 2. If the difference is greater, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'. If the third element of `clues` is greater than the fifth element of `clues`, the difference between the second element of `clues` and the fifth element of `clues` is compared to the absolute value of half the difference between the third element of `clues` and the fourth element of `clues`. If the difference is greater, then `answers` contains 'Draw'. Otherwise, `answers` contains 'Bob'.***
