Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the game strategy between Alice and Bob. Alice removes at most k elements from the array, and Bob multiplies at most x elements of the array by -1. The program calculates the sum of elements of the array after the game if both players play optimally.

The program sorts the array in descending order and then iterates over the possible number of elements that Alice can remove (from 0 to k). For each iteration, it calculates the sum of the remaining elements after Bob's move. The maximum sum is then printed as the result.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where k or x is 0, or where the array has only one element. The program also correctly handles the case where the array has negative numbers, although this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
