Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. If i is 0, the updated value of sums is equal to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). If i is not 0, then if i + x - 1 is less than n, the updated value of sums is equal to the previous value of sums plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, the updated value of sums is the sum of the integers in a plus a[i - 1].***
