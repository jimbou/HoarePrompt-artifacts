The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again `i` must be less than `k + 1`, so `i` is increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than `i - 1`. 
State: **`n`, `k` must be greater than `i - 1`, `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `sums` are integers**
