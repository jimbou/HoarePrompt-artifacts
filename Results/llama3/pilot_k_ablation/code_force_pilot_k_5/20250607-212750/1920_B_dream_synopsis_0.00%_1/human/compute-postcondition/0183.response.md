Output State: **n is an integer, k is larger or equal to i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, ans is a list containing the value of sums plus a[i - 1], i is increased by 1, sums is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a up to index x + 1 if i is 0, or the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the integer at index i + x - 1 plus the integer at index i - 1 if i is not equal to 0 and i + x - 1 is less than n, or the sum of the integers in a up to index i - 1 plus its original value, and incremented by the integer at index i - 1 if i is not equal to 0 and i + x - 1 is larger or equal to n.**

The code increments the value of `sums` by the integer at index `i - 1` in the list `a`, and appends this new value of `sums` to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
