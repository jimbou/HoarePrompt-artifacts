Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`.***
