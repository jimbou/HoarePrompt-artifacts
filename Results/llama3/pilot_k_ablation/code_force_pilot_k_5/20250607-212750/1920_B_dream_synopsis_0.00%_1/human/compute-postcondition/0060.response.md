Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is increased by 1, ans is updated according to the new value of i, sums is increased by the value of a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `k`, `x`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `ans` is updated according to the new value of `i`. The value of `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`, which is the `i-th` element of the list `a`. The list `a` remains in descending order.
