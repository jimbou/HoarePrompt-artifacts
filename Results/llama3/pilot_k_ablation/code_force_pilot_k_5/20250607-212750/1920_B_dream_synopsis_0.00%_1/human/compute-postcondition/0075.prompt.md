Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is not less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated according to the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i` and `x`. Otherwise, `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated according to the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. If `i` is 1, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i` and `x`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`. `k` must be greater than `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `sums` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated according to the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0 or 1, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i` and `x`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n`, `k` are greater than `i - 1`, `i` is increased by 1, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `sums` are integers. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`, `sums` is equal to `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of `a`. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list of integers with `sums` appended to it, `sums` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list of integers with the updated `sums` value appended, `sums` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[i - 1]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
