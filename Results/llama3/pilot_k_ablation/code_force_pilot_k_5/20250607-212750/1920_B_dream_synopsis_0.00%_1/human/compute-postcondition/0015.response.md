Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the value of sums plus a[i - 1], ans is a list containing the value of sums.**

The code modifies the values of `sums`, `i`, and `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The list `ans` is appended with the updated value of `sums`. The other variables remain unchanged.
