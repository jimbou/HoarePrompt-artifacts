Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, `i` is not equal to 0. The current value of `i` plus `x` minus 1 is less than `n`.**
