Postcondition: ***n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin, i, ans are integers. If i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, sums is the sum of the integers in a up to index i - 1. In both cases, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, and stdin remains empty.***
