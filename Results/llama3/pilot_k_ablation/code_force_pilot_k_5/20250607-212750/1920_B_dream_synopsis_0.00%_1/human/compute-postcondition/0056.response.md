Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated according to the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. Otherwise, if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i` and `x`. Otherwise, `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`.***
