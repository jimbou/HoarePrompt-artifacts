Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is increased by 1. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`.**
