Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 minus twice the sum of the first x+1 elements of a, sums is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the first x+1 elements of a, i is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is updated to include the value of `sums`, which is calculated as the sum of the integers in `a` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`. The value of `sums` is also updated to include the value of `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `i` is increased by 1.
