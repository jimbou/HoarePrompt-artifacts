Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 2, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is 3, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1], where sums is the sum of the integers in a from index i-1 to i+x-1 minus twice the integer at index i+x-1 if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the sum of a[i - 1] and its previous value. If i + x - 1 is less than n, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1].***
