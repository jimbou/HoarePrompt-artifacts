Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are greater than `i - 1`, `i` is increased by 1, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, `ans`, `sums` are integers. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `ans` is a list of integers with sums appended to it, `sums` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list of integers with the updated sums value appended, `sums` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[i - 1]`.***
