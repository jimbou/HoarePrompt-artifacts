The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `k` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than the new value of `i`. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than `i`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the value of `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is the value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`, `i` is increased by 1**
