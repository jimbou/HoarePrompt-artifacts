Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1], stdin contains no input, i is not equal to 0, and i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, sums is the value of sums + a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` to it, and this new value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
