The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line adds the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums`, updating the value of `sums`. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

Output State: **n is greater than i - 1, k is greater than i - 1, i is increased by 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers, sum1 is an integer, stdin contains input, ans is a list of integers with the updated sums value appended, sums is an integer equal to its original value plus a[i - 1]**
