Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains three integers t, k, and x (1 <= t <= 10^4, 1 <= k,x <= t). The second line contains t integers a_1, a_2,...,a_t (1 <= a_i <= 1000).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k, x = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    a.sort()
    a.reverse()
    sum1 = sum(a)
    ans = []
    for i in range(k + 1):
        if i == 0:
            sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
            ans.append(sums)
        elif i + x - 1 < n:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
        else:
            sums = sums + a[i - 1]
            ans.append(sums)
    print(max(ans))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list of integers, stdin contains no input, and the maximum value in the list ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list of integers containing the sums of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2, and `sums` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`, and the maximum value in the list `ans` is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is equal to k + 1, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1], where sums is the sum of the integers in a from index i-1 to i+x-1 minus twice the integer at index i+x-1 if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the sum of a[i - 1] and its previous value. If i is 0, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) and the value of sums + a[i - 1]. Otherwise, if i + x - 1 is less than n, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1], and the maximum value in the list ans is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is equal to k, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. If k is 0, the updated value of sums is equal to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if k + x - 1 is less than n, the updated value of sums is the previous value of sums plus a[k - 1] minus 2 times a[k + x - 1]. Otherwise, the updated value of sums remains the same, and the maximum value of the updated sums is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`. `i` is increased by 1. and the maximum value in the list `ans` is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
