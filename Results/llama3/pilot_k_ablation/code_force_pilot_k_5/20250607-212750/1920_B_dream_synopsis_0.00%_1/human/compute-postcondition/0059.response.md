Output State: **n, k, x are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is increased by 1, ans is updated according to the new value of i, sums is the sum of the integers in a excluding the first x+1 integers multiplied by 2 if i is 1, otherwise sums is updated according to the new value of i and x if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is increased by the value of a[i - 1], k must be greater than i**
