Postcondition: **`n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, and `sum1` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`. `i` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`.**
