Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than `i`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sum1` minus twice the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`, and `i` is increased by 1. If `i` is not 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the value of `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is the value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`. Regardless of the condition, `i` is increased by 1 and `ans` contains the value of `sums`.**
