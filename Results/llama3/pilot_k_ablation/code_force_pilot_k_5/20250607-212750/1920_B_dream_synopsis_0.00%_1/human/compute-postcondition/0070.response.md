Output State: **n is greater than i - 1, k is greater than i - 1, i is increased by 1, a is an integer, sum1 is an integer, stdin is empty, ans is a list containing the value of sums, sums is equal to sum1 minus 2 times the sum of the first x + 1 elements of a, x is an integer.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, and `x` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `sums` is calculated as the difference between `sum1` and twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of `a`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the value of `sums` to the list.
