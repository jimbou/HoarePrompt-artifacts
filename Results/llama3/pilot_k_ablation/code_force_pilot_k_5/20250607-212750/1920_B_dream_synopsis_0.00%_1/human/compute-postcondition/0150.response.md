Output State: **n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin is empty, i is k, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums.**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line adds the value of `a[i - 1]` to `sums`, updating the value of `sums`. Since `i` is equal to `k`, `a[i - 1]` refers to the element at index `k - 1` in the list `a`. The second line appends the updated value of `sums` to the list `ans`.

After executing the code block, the value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[k - 1]` to it. The list `ans` now contains the updated value of `sums` as its last element. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still equal to `k`.
