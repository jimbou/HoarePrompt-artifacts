Output State: **`n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `i` is not equal to 0. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`. `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `a`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is updated to include the value of `sums`, which is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value. The value of `sums` is also updated to include the value of `a[i - 1]` added to its original value.
