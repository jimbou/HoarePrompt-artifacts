To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `k`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is increased by 1, so we need to increment `i` by 1 again for the loop to execute one more time.

The state of `k` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`**

Note that the states of `n`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, and `ans` remain unchanged, as they are not modified within the loop head.
