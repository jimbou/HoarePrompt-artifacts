Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is increased by 1, ans is updated according to the new value of i, sums is updated according to the new value of i and x.**

The code snippet modifies the values of `sums` and `ans`. The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the new value of `sums`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. No other variables are affected.
