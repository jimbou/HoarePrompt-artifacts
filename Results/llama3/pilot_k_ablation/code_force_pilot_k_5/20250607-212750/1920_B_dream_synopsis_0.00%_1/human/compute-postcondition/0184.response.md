Postcondition: ***n, k, x, and i are integers. a is a list of integers in descending order. sum1 is the sum of the integers in a. stdin is empty. ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. i is increased by 1. If i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the integer at index i + x - 1 plus the integer at index i - 1. Otherwise, sums is the sum of the integers in a up to index i - 1 plus its original value, and incremented by the integer at index i - 1.***
