Postcondition: ***n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin is empty, i is k, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. If i is 0, the updated value of sums is equal to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if i + x - 1 is less than n, the updated value of sums is the previous value of sums plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, the updated value of sums remains the same.***
