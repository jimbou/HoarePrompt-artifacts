Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`, where `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `i-1` to `i+x-1` minus twice the integer at index `i+x-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`, where `sums` is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and its previous value. In both cases, `i` is 1.***
