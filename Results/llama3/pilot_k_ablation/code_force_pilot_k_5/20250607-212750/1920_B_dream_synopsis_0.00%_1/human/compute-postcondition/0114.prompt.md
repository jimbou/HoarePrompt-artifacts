Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is equal to k + 1, ans is an empty list, and sums is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, then `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `i-1` to `i+x-1` minus twice the integer at index `i+x-1`. Otherwise, `sums` is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and its previous value, and `ans` contains the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, then `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`, where `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `i-1` to `i+x-1` minus twice the integer at index `i+x-1` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `sums` is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and its previous value. In both cases, `i` is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, then `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`, where `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `i-1` to `i+x-1` minus twice the integer at index `i+x-1` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `sums` is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and its previous value. In both cases, `i` is 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 2, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is 3, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1], where sums is the sum of the integers in a from index i-1 to i+x-1 minus twice the integer at index i+x-1 if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the sum of a[i - 1] and its previous value. If i is 0, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) and the value of sums + a[i - 1]. Otherwise, if i + x - 1 is less than n, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1].

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 2, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is 4, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1], where sums is the sum of the integers in a from index i-1 to i+x-1 minus twice the integer at index i+x-1 if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the sum of a[i - 1] and its previous value. If i is 0, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) and the value of sums + a[i - 1]. Otherwise, if i + x - 1 is less than n, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, the value of sums + a[i - 1] is updated to sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1].




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
