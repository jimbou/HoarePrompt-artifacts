Output State: **n, k, x are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is increased by 1, ans is updated according to the new value of i, sums is the sum of the integers in a excluding the first x+1 integers multiplied by 2.**

The code snippet calculates the sum of the integers in list `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2, and appends this sum to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i` and `x`. The value of `k` is not affected by the code snippet, but it must be greater than `i`. The list `a` and the sum of its integers `sum1` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
