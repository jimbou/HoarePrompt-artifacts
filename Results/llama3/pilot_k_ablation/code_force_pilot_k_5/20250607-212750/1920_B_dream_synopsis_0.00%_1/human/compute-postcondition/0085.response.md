Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is not equal to 0, ans is a list containing the value of sums, and sums is the sum of the integers in a from index i-1 to i+x-1 minus twice the integer at index i+x-1.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` is calculated by adding the integer at index `i-1` in list `a` and subtracting twice the integer at index `i+x-1` in list `a`. This value is then appended to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
