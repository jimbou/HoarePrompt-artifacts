Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is not defined, ans is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not equal to 0, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the value of `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is the value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, k, x are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) and k is an integer greater than i + 1. If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans is a list containing the value of sums which is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1], i is increased by 1 and k is greater than i. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, ans is a list containing the value of sums plus a[i - 1], where sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the value of sums plus a[i - 1], i is increased by 1 and k is greater than i + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n, k, x are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) and k is an integer greater than i + 1. If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans is a list containing the value of sums which is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1], i is increased by 1 and k is greater than i. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, ans is a list containing the value of sums plus a[i - 1], where sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the value of sums plus a[i - 1], i is increased by 1 and k is greater than i + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin, i, ans are integers. If i is 0, then sums is the updated value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]), i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, and stdin remains empty. If i is not 0, then if i + x - 1 is less than n, then sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, sums is the sum of the integers in a up to index i - 1. In both cases, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, and stdin remains empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin is empty, i is k, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. If i is 0, the updated value of sums is equal to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if i + x - 1 is less than n, the updated value of sums is the previous value of sums plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1]. Otherwise, the updated value of sums remains the same.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
