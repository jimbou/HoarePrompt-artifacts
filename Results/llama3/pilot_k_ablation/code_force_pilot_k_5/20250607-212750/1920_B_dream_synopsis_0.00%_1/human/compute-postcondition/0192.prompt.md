Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is not defined, ans is an empty list
Code of the loop:
for i in range(k + 1):
    if i == 0:
        sums = sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])
        ans.append(sums)
    elif i + x - 1 < n:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1]
        ans.append(sums)
    else:
        sums = sums + a[i - 1]
        ans.append(sums)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`. `i` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. `i` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, and `sum1` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`. `i` is increased by 1. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers greater than `i - 1`, `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `sum1` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is an integer equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to the previous value of `sums` plus the element at index `i - 1` in list `a`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
