Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers greater than `i - 1`, `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `sum1` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, then `sums` is an integer equal to `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not 0, then if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated to the previous value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `sums` is updated to the previous value of `sums` plus the element at index `i - 1` in list `a`.***
