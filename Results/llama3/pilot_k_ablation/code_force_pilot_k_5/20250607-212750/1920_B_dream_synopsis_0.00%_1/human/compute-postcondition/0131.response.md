Output State: **n, k, x are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1], i is increased by 1, k is greater than i, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The value of `sums` is updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `ans` is updated by appending the new value of `sums`. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and `k` is still greater than `i`. The state of `stdin` remains empty as it was not used in the code.
