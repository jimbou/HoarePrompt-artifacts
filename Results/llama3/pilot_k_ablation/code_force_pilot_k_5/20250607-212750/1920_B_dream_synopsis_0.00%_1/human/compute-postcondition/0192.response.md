Output State: **`n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`. `i` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the final state of the variables is as follows: `n`, `k`, `x`, and `i` are integers, with `k` being larger or equal to 0. The list `a` contains integers in descending order, and `sum1` is the sum of these integers. The standard input `stdin` is empty, and the list `ans` contains the final value of `sums`. The value of `sums` depends on the value of `i`: if `i` is 0, it is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`. Finally, `i` is increased by 1.
