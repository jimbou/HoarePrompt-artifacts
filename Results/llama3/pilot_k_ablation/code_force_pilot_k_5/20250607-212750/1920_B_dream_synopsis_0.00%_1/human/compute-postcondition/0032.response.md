Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums, sums is the updated value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting twice the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `ans` has been updated by appending the new value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
