The code prints the maximum value in the `ans` list, which contains the sums of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2.
Output: **the maximum value in the `ans` list (which is the maximum sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2)**
