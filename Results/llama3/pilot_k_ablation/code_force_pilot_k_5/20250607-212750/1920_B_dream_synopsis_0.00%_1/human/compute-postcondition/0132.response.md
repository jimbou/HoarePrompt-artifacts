Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums plus a[i - 1], sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the value of sums plus a[i - 1], i is increased by 1, stdin is empty.**

The code increments the value of `sums` by the value of `a[i - 1]`, then appends this new value to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. No other variables are affected.
