Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is not equal to 0, ans is a list containing the value of sums, sums is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the integer at index i + x - 1 plus the integer at index i - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the integer at index `i - 1` in list `a` and subtracting 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` in list `a`. This updated value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
