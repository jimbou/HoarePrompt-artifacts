Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is an empty list, stdin is empty**.

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code assigns the integer values from the input to `n`, `k`, and `x`. It then reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to `a`. The list `a` is sorted in descending order. The sum of the integers in `a` is calculated and assigned to `sum1`. An empty list `ans` is created. The maximum value in the list `ans` is not printed because `ans` is empty. The input is consumed, leaving stdin empty.
