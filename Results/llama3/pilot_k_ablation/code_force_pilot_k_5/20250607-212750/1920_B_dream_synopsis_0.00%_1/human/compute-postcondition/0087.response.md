Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is not equal to 0, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1], and sums is the sum of a[i - 1] and its previous value.**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated to include the value of `a[i - 1]`, and `ans` now contains this updated value of `sums`. All other variables remain unchanged.
