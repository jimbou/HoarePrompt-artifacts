Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums which is the sum of the integers in a plus a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, `sum1`, and `stdin` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code snippet. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `ans` is updated to contain the new value of `sums`, which is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the integer at index `i - 1` in `a`.
