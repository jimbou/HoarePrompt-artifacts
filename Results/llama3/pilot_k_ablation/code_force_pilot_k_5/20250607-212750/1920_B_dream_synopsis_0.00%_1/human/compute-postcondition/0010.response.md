Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is not equal to 0, and `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the value of `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is the value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`.***
