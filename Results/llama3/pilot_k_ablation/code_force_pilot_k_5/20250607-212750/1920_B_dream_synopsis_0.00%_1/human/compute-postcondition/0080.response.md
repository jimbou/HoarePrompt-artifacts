To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `k`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is at least 0, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to `k + 1`, we can adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range. We also need to ensure that `k` is greater than or equal to 0.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0, `ans` is an empty list, and `sums` is not defined**
