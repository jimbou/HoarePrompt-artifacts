Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums which is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the value of sums plus a[i - 1], i is increased by 1.**

The code calculates the value of `sums` by subtracting twice the sum of the first `x + 1` elements of list `a` from `sum1`, which is the sum of all elements in `a`. This value is then appended to the list `ans`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged.
