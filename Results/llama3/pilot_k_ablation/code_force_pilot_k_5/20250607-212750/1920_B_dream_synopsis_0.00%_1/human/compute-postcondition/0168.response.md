The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer, `k` is larger or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `k`, `x`, `i` are integers. `k` is larger or equal to 0. `a` is a list of integers in descending order. `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`. `stdin` is empty. `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i` is 1, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x`. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. If `i` is not equal to 1 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value. `i` is increased by 1**
