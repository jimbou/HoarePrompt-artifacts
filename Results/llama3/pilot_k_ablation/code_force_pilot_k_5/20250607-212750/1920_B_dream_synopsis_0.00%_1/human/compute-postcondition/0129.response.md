The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some value, `k` is some value. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and must be less than `k + 1`. So `i` is increased by 1 and `k` remains the same.

State: **`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 1, `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. If `i` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` plus the value of `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is the value of `sums` plus `a[i - 1]`, `i` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than `i`**
