Postcondition: **n, k, x are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty. If i is 0, ans is a list containing the value of sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]) and k is an integer greater than i + 1. If i is not equal to 0, if i + x - 1 is less than n, ans is a list containing the value of sums which is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1], i is increased by 1 and k is greater than i. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, ans is a list containing the value of sums plus a[i - 1], where sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise sums is the value of sums plus a[i - 1], i is increased by 1 and k is greater than i + 1.**
