Output State: **n, k, x are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is equal to the value of t, ans is a list containing the maximum sum of the integers in a excluding the first x+1 integers multiplied by 2, and the maximum value in the list ans is printed**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the input has been fully processed, and the maximum sum of the integers in the list `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2 has been calculated and printed. The loop has iterated `t` times, and the value of `i` has reached the value of `t`. The list `ans` contains the maximum sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2, and this maximum value is printed as the output.
