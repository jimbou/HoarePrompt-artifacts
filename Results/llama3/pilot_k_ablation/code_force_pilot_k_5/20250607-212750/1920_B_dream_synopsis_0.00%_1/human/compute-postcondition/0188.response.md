Output State: **n, k are greater than i - 1, x, i is increased by 1, sum1 are integers, a is a list of integers in descending order, stdin is empty, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums which is the previous value of sums plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, `sum1`, and `a` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` from its previous value. The updated value of `sums` is then appended to the list `ans`. The state of `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
