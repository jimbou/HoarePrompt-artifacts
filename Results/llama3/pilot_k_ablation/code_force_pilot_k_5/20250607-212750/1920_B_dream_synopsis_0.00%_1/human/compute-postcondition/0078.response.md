State: **`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is not empty, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, `ans` is a list of integers containing the sums of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2, and `sums` is an integer equal to its original value plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`, and the maximum value in the list `ans` is printed**
