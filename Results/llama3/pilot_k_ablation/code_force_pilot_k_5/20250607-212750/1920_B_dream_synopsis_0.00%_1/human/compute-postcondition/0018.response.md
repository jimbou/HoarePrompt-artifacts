The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k + 1`, so `i` is increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than `i`. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than `i + 1`, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums`**
