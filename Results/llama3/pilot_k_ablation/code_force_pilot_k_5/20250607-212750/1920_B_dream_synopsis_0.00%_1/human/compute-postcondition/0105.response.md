Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 2, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is 3, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1] and the value of sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` is not explicitly defined, but it is used to calculate the values appended to the `ans` list. The `ans` list now contains two values: the original value of `sums + a[i - 1]` and the new value of `sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1]`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
