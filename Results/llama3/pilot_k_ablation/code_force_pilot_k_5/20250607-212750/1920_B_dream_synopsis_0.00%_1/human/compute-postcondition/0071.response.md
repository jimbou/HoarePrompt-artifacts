Output State: **n is greater than i - 1, k is greater than i - 1, i is increased by 1, a is an integer, sum1 is an integer, stdin is an integer, ans is a list of integers with sums appended to it, sums is an integer equal to its original value plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `i`, `a`, `sum1`, `stdin`, and `ans` remain unchanged from their initial state. The value of `sums` is updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting 2 times `a[i + x - 1]` from its original value. The list `ans` is appended with the updated value of `sums`.
