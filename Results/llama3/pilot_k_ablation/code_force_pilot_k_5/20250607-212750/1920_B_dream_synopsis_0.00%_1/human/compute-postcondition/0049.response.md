Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer that must be at least 0, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is not equal to 0. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, then `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` plus `a[i - 1]` minus 2 times `a[i + x - 1]`. Otherwise, `ans` is a list containing the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1`***
