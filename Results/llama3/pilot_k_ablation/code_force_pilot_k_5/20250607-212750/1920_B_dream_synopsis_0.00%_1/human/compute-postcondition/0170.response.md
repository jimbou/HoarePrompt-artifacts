Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer larger or equal to 0, x is an integer, i is an integer incremented by 1, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, ans is a list containing the value of sums, sums is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a up to index x if i is 1, or the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the integer at index i + x - 1 plus the integer at index i - 1 if i is not equal to 1 and i + x - 1 is less than n, or the sum of the integers in a up to index i - 1 plus its original value if i is not equal to 1 and i + x - 1 is larger or equal to n**
