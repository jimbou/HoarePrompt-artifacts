Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `x` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is increased by 1, `ans` is updated according to the new value of `i`. If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. If `i` is 1, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i` and `x`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`. `k` must be greater than `i`.***
