Postcondition: **n, k, x, i are integers. k is larger or equal to 0. a is a list of integers in descending order. sum1 is the sum of the integers in a. stdin is empty. ans is a list containing the value of sums. If i is 1, sums is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a up to index x. If i is not equal to 1 and i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the integer at index i + x - 1 plus the integer at index i - 1. If i is not equal to 1 and i + x - 1 is larger or equal to n, sums is the sum of the integers in a up to index i - 1 plus its original value. If i + x - 1 is larger or equal to n, sums is incremented by the integer at index i - 1. i is increased by 1.**
