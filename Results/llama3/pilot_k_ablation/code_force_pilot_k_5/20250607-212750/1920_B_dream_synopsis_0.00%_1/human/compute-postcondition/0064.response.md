Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is increased by 1, ans is updated according to the new value of i. If i is 0, sums is the sum of the integers in a excluding the first x+1 integers multiplied by 2. If i is 1, sums is the sum of the integers in a excluding the first x+1 integers multiplied by 2. If i + x - 1 is less than n, sums is updated according to the new value of i and x. If i + x - 1 is greater than or equal to n, sums is increased by the value of a[i - 1].**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `sum1` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1, and the value of `ans` is updated according to the new value of `i`. The value of `sums` is updated based on the value of `i` and `x`. If `i` is 0 or 1, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` excluding the first `x+1` integers multiplied by 2. If `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is updated according to the new value of `i` and `x`. If `i + x - 1` is greater than or equal to `n`, `sums` is increased by the value of `a[i - 1]`.
