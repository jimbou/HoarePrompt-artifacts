Output State: **n, k, x, a, sum1, stdin is empty, i is k, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums which is the previous value of sums plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding `a[i - 1]` and subtracting `2 * a[i + x - 1]` from its previous value. This updated value of `sums` is then appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
