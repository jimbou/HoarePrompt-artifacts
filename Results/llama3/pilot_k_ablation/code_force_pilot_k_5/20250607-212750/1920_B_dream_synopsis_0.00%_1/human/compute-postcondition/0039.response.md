The only objects in the loop head are variable `_` and stdin, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the stdin. If the stdin contains at least one more integer the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed one more time the stdin must contain at least one integer.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `ans` is a list of integers, stdin contains at least one integer, and the maximum value in the list `ans` is being printed**
