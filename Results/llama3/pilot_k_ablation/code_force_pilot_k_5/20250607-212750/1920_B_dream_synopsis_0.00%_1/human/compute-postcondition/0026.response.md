Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than i + 1, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin contains no input, i is increased by 1, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums which is equal to the previous value of sums plus a[i - 1] minus 2 times a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. The value of `i` has been increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
