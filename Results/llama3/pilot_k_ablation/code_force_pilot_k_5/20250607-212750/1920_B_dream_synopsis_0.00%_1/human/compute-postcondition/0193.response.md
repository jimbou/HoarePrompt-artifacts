The code prints the maximum value in the `ans` list, which contains the value of `sums`. The value of `sums` depends on the value of `i`. 

If `i` is 0, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`. 

If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the integer at index `i + x - 1` plus the integer at index `i - 1`. 

If `i` is not equal to 0 and `i + x - 1` is larger or equal to `n`, `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `i - 1` plus its original value, and `sums` is incremented by the integer at index `i - 1`. 

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, and the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `sums`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum value in the `ans` list.

Output: **the maximum value in the `ans` list (which contains the value of `sums` calculated based on the conditions described above)**
