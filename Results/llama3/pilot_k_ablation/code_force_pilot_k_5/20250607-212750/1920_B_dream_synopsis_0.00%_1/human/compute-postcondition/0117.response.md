State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is not empty, i is equal to k + 1, ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1] - 2 * a[i + x - 1] if i + x - 1 is less than n, otherwise ans is a list containing the value of sums + a[i - 1] + a[i - 1]**
