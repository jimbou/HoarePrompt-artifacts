The code prints the maximum value in the list `ans`, which contains the updated values of `sums` based on the conditions specified in the initial state.

Since the exact values of `n`, `k`, `x`, and the list `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `max(ans)`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the maximum updated value of `sums` according to the conditions specified.

Output: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is equal to k, ans is a list containing the updated value of sums. If k is 0, the updated value of sums is equal to sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1]). Otherwise, if k + x - 1 is less than n, the updated value of sums is the previous value of sums plus a[k - 1] minus 2 times a[k + x - 1]. Otherwise, the updated value of sums remains the same, and the maximum value of the updated sums is printed**
