The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `k`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `k` must be greater than or equal to 2.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is 0, then `ans` is a list containing one element which is the value of `sum1` minus 2 times the sum of the first `x+1` elements of `a`. If `i` is not equal to 0, then `ans` is a list containing the value of `sums + a[i - 1]`, where `sums` is the sum of the integers in `a` from index `i-1` to `i+x-1` minus twice the integer at index `i+x-1` if `i + x - 1` is less than `n`, otherwise `sums` is the sum of `a[i - 1]` and its previous value. In both cases, `i` is 2.**
