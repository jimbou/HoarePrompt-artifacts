The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the input. If the input is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, stdin is empty, so for the loop to execute again, stdin must not be empty.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `sum1` is the sum of the integers in `a`, stdin is not empty, `i` is equal to `k`, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of sums**
