The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `k + 1`. So, `i` is increased by 1 and `k` must be greater than `i - 1`.

State: **`n`, `k` must be greater than `i - 1`, `x`, `i` is increased by 1, `sum1` are integers, `a` is a list of integers in descending order, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is a list containing the updated value of `sums`.**
