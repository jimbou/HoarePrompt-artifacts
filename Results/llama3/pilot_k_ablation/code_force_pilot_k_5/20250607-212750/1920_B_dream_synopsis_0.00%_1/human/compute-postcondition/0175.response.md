Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer larger or equal to 0, x is an integer, i is an integer incremented by 1, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums which is the sum of the integers in a minus 2 times the sum of the integers in a up to index x + 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1. The value of `sums` has been calculated as the sum of the integers in `a` minus 2 times the sum of the integers in `a` up to index `x + 1`, and this value has been appended to the list `ans`. All other variables remain unchanged.
