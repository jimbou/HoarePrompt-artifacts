Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, stdin is empty, i is not defined, ans is an empty list**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The code snippet reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `x`, respectively. Then, it reads a list of integers from stdin, sorts them in descending order, and assigns them to `a`. The sum of the integers in `a` is calculated and assigned to `sum1`. The list `ans` is initialized as an empty list. The variable `i` is not defined in the given code snippet. After the execution of the code, stdin is empty.
