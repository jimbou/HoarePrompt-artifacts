Output State: **n is an integer, k is greater than or equal to 0, x is an integer, a is a list of integers in descending order, sum1 is the sum of the integers in a, ans is a list containing the value of sums, stdin contains no input, i is not equal to 0, sums is the sum of the integers in a plus the value of a[i - 1] minus 2 times the value of a[i + x - 1].**

In this output state, the value of `sums` has been updated by adding the value of `a[i - 1]` and subtracting 2 times the value of `a[i + x - 1]`. This new value of `sums` has been appended to the list `ans`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
