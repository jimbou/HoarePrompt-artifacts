The `print(max(ans))` statement will print the maximum value in the `ans` list. The `ans` list contains the updated value of `sums` at each iteration.

Since `i` is equal to `k`, the value of `sums` is updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state. If `k` is 0, the updated value of `sums` is `sum1 - 2 * sum(a[:x + 1])`. Otherwise, if `k + x - 1` is less than `n`, the updated value of `sums` is the previous value of `sums` plus `a[k - 1]` minus 2 times `a[k + x - 1]`. Otherwise, the updated value of `sums` remains the same.

The `max(ans)` function returns the maximum value in the `ans` list, which contains the updated values of `sums` at each iteration.

Output: **the maximum value of sums (where sums is the sum of the integers in list a, updated based on the conditions specified in the initial state)**
