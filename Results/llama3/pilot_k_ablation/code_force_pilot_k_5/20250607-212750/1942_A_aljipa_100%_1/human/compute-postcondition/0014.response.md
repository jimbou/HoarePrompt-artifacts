Output State: **t is an integer (3 <= t <= 10^3), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 3, res is a list of integers, stdin contains t - 4 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and the elements of the list res are being printed**

The code reads a pair of integers n and k from stdin, and assigns them to the variables n and k. The value of t remains unchanged. The variable _ is not affected by the code and remains 3. The list res is updated based on the values of n and k. If k is equal to n, res becomes a list of n ones. If k is equal to 1, res becomes a list of integers from 1 to n. If k is neither 1 nor n, res becomes a list containing only -1. The elements of the list res are being printed. Stdin now contains t - 4 pairs of integers n and k.
