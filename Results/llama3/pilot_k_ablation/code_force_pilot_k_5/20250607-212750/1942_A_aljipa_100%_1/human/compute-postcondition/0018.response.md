Output State: **t is an integer (3 <= t <= 10^3), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 4, res is a list of integers, stdin contains t - 6 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

The code reads a pair of integers n and k from stdin, and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. The value of t is not affected by this line. The value of _ is also not affected by this line. 

The second line assigns a new value to the variable res. If k is equal to n, res becomes a list of n ones. If k is equal to 1, res becomes a list of integers from 1 to n. If k is neither equal to n nor 1, res becomes a list containing a single -1. The value of t is not affected by this line. The value of _ is also not affected by this line. 

The value of stdin is affected by the first line, as it now contains t - 6 pairs of integers n and k. The value of n is affected by the first line, as it now contains the value of the first integer in the pair. The value of k is affected by the first line, as it now contains the value of the second integer in the pair. The value of res is affected by the second line, as it now contains the new list of integers.
