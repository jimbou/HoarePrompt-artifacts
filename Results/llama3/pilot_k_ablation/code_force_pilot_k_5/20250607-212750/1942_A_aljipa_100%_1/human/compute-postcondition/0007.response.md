The code prints the elements of the list `res` which contains integers.
Since the exact values of the integers in the list `res` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in the list `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the list `res`.
Output: **the elements of the list res (where the list res contains integers)**
