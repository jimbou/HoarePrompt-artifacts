The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer input from stdin and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin initially contains two inputs: first an integer `t` and then `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`. Since the first input is accepted and assigned to `t`, the stdin now contains `t` pairs of integers `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), stdin contains t pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**
