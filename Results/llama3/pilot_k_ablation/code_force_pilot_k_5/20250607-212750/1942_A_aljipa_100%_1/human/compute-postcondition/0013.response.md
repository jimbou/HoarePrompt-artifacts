The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `t` is between 2 and 10^3. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **t is an integer (3 <= t <= 10^3), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 3, res is a list of integers, stdin contains t - 3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and the elements of the list res are being printed**
