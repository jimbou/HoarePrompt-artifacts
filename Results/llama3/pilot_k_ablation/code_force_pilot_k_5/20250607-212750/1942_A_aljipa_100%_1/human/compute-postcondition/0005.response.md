To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means the loop will execute `t` times. The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, which means its value is not used anywhere in the loop body.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3)
* `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3)
* `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n)
* `_` is 0
* `res` is a list of integers
* `stdin` contains `t - 1` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)
* The list of integers in `res` is being printed

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop executes again. Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not important. The value of `t` is not changed by the loop, so it remains the same.

The only change is that the loop has executed once, so the value of `_` is incremented by 1. However, since `_` is a throwaway variable, this change does not affect the state of the program.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 1, `res` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `t - 2` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and the list of integers in `res` is being printed**

Note that the value of `_` is now 1, but this change does not affect the state of the program. The other variables remain the same.
