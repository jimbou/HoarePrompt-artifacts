Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 1, res is a list of integers, stdin contains t - 3 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and the list of integers in res is being printed**

The code reads a pair of integers `n` and `k` from `stdin`, and assigns them to the variables `n` and `k`, respectively. Then, it constructs a list `res` based on the values of `n` and `k`. If `k` is equal to `n`, `res` becomes a list of `n` ones. If `k` is equal to 1, `res` becomes a list of integers from 1 to `n`. Otherwise, `res` becomes a list containing only -1. The list `res` is then being printed. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the value of `_` is not affected by the code. The number of pairs of integers in `stdin` decreases by 1.
