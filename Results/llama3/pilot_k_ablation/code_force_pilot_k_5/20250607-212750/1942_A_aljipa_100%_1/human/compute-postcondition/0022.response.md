Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two integers, n and k. For each test case, it generates a list of integers based on the values of n and k. If k is equal to n, the list contains all 1s. If k is 1, the list contains the numbers from 1 to n. Otherwise, the list contains a single -1. The function then prints the generated list for each test case.**
