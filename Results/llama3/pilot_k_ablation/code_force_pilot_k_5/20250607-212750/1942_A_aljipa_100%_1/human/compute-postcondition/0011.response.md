Based on the precondition, the `res` list contains integers, and the `print(*res)` statement will print all the elements in the `res` list.

Since the exact values of the elements in the `res` list are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values that will be printed. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of the `res` list.

Output: **elements of the res list (where res is a list of integers)**
