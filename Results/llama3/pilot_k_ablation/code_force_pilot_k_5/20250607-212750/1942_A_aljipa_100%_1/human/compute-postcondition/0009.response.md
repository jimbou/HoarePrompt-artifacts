To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must be greater than the current iteration.

Since `_` is a throwaway variable, its value is not important, but we can infer that it will be incremented to 2. The value of `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^3), `n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), `k` is an integer (1 <= k <= n), `_` is 2, `res` is a list of integers, `stdin` contains `t - 3` pairs of integers `n` and `k` (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3), and the list of integers in `res` is being printed**
