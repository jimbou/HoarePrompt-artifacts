Output State: **t is an integer (1 <= t <= 10^3), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 0, res is a list of integers, stdin contains t - 1 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

The code reads a pair of integers n and k from stdin, and assigns them to the variables n and k, respectively. The value of t is not modified by the code, so it remains an integer between 1 and 10^3. The variable _ is also not modified, so it remains 0. The code then creates a list res based on the values of n and k. If k is equal to n, res is a list of n ones. If k is equal to 1, res is a list of integers from 1 to n. Otherwise, res is a list containing only -1. The code does not modify the value of t, so stdin still contains t - 1 pairs of integers n and k.
