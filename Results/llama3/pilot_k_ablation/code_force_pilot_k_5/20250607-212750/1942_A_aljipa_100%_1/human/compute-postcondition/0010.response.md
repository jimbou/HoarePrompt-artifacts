Output State: **t is an integer (2 <= t <= 10^3), n is an integer (1 <= n <= 10^3), k is an integer (1 <= k <= n), _ is 2, res is a list of integers, stdin contains t - 4 pairs of integers n and k (1 <= k <= n <= 10^3)**

The code first reads a pair of integers n and k from stdin, reducing the number of pairs in stdin by 1. Then, it assigns a new value to the list res based on the values of n and k. If k is equal to n, res becomes a list of 1s with a length of n. If k is 1, res becomes a list of integers from 1 to n. If k is neither 1 nor n, res becomes a list containing only -1. The values of t, _, and the remaining pairs in stdin are not affected by the code.
