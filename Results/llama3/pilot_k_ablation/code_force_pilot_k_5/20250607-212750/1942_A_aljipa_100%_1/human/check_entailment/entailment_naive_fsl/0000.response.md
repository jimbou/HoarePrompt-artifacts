Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, when n = 3 and k = 2, the program outputs [-1], but it should output a valid array a that satisfies the requirements. 

The program only handles the cases when k is equal to n or 1, but it does not handle the cases when k is between 1 and n (exclusive). 

For instance, when n = 3 and k = 2, a valid array a could be [1, 2, 1], which has exactly 2 sorted cyclic shifts: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 1]. However, the program does not output this array, but instead outputs [-1], indicating that there is no valid array a. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
