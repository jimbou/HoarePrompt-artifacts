Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of finding an array `a` of length `n` that satisfies the condition of having exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program uses a simple and efficient approach to generate the desired array.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `k` is equal to `n`, it means that all cyclic shifts of the array should be sorted. In this case, the program generates an array of `n` ones, which satisfies the condition.
2. If `k` is equal to 1, it means that only one cyclic shift of the array should be sorted. In this case, the program generates an array of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, which satisfies the condition.
3. If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, it means that there is no valid array that satisfies the condition. In this case, the program outputs -1.

The program's logic is correct, and it covers all possible cases. The use of list comprehensions and conditional expressions makes the code concise and efficient.

Correctness: **True**
