Reasoning:

The problem requires finding an array `a` of length `n` that has exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts. The program attempts to solve this problem by considering three cases:

1. If `k` is equal to `n`, the program returns an array of all ones, which indeed has `n` sorted cyclic shifts.
2. If `k` is equal to 1, the program returns an array of consecutive integers from 1 to `n`, which indeed has 1 sorted cyclic shift.
3. If `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1, the program returns an array containing only -1, indicating that there is no solution.

However, the program does not provide a correct solution for the case where `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1. In fact, it is impossible to construct an array with exactly `k` sorted cyclic shifts when `k` is neither equal to `n` nor 1.

For example, consider the case where `n` is 3 and `k` is 2. The program returns an array containing only -1, indicating that there is no solution. However, this is incorrect, as there is indeed a solution: the array [1, 2, 3] has 2 sorted cyclic shifts.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
