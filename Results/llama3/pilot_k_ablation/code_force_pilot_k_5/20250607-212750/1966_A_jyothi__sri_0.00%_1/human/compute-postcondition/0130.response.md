Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`. If the value of the first integer `i` in the list `a` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `h` is a dictionary with the first integer from the list `a` as a key. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary with the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key and its value is 1, `ams` is not defined, and `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.***
