The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `a`. If `a` has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the next integer `j` in the list `a` is a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value of `j` in `h` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, the value of `i` in `h` is set to 1. If the value of `j` in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` is equal to `n`.**
