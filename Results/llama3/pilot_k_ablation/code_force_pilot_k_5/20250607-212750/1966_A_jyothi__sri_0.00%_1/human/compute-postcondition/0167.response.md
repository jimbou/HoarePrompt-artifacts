Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` contains the key `i` with a value that is 2 more than its previous value if `i` was already in `h` and its previous value was at least 1, otherwise, `h` contains `i` as a key with 1 as its value, and `ams` is equal to `k - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `ans`, and `h` remain the same as in the initial state. However, the value of `ams` is now explicitly defined and is equal to `k - 1`, regardless of the value of `h[i]`.
