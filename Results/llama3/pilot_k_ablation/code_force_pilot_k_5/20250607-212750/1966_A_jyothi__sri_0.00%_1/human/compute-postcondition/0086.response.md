Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `i` is the first element in the list. If the value of `i` in dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ams`.***
