Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary with the first integer from the list `a` as a key if the first integer `i` in the list `a` was already a key in the dictionary `h`, otherwise `h` is a dictionary with the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key and its value is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ams` has been updated to `k-1`, while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The dictionary `h` still contains the first integer from the list `a` as a key if it was already present, or the second integer from the list `a` as a key with a value of 1 if it was not present.
