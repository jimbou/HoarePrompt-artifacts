Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list, `h[i]` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is in the value of `h[i]`, which is incremented by 1.
