Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in the list. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary where the key `i` is mapped to the value 1. If the value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.***
