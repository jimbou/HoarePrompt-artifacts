Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ams` is now equal to `k-1`, which is a new variable introduced by the code. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being an integer, `k` still being an integer, `a` still being a list of integers with at least one element, `h` still being a dictionary with integer frequencies, `ans` still being equal to `n`, and `i` still being the first integer in the list `a`. The input is still empty.
