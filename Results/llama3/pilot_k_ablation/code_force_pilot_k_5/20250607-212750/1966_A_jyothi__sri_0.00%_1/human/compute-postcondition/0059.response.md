Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`. If `i` is already in the dictionary `h`, then the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is increased by 1. If the new frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the new frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`. If `i` is not in the dictionary `h`, then `i` is added to the dictionary `h` with a frequency of 1. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ams` is now `k-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has at least 3 integers, and the dictionary `h` still contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The value of `i` is still the third integer in the list `a`. The value of `ans` is still dependent on the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` and the value of `k`.
