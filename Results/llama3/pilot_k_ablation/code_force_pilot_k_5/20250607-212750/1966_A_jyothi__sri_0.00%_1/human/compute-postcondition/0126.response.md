Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the value of the first integer `i` in the list `a` is incremented by 1, if the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` and `k` remains the same. The list `a` also remains the same. The value of `ans` is still equal to `n`. The dictionary `h` has been updated such that the value of the first integer `i` in the list `a` has been incremented by 1. If the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1` and `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.
