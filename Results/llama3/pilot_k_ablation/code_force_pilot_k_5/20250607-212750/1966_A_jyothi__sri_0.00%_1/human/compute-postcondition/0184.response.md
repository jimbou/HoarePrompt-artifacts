Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 5 integers, i is the fifth integer in the list, ans is equal to n. If i is already in dictionary h and its previous value was at least 1, then h contains the key i with a value that is 2 more than its previous value. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. If the value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined.***
