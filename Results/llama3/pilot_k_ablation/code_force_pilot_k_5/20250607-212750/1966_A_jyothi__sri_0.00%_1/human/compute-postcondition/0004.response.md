Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary that contains the first integer `i` of the list `a` and the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is increased by 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, and the current value of `i` is in the dictionary `h`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the current integer `i` in the dictionary `h` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
