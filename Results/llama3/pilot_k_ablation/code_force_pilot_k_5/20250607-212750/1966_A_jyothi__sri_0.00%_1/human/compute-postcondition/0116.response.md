The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, ans is equal to n. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is an empty dictionary, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first integer in the list**
