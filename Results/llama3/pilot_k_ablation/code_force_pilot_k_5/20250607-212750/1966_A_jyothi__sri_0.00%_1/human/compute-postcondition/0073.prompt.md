Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, h is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, ans is equal to n, and the input is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, no change is made to `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the fifth integer in the list `a`. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
