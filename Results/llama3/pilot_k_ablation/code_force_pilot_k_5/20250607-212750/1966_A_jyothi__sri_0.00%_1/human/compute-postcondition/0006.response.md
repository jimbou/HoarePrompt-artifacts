The code `h[i] = 1` assigns the value 1 to the key `i` in the dictionary `h`. The value of `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary with the first integer in `a` as a key and value 1, `ans` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers, and `i` is the first integer in the list `a` and is now a key in `h` with value 1.**
