Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k - 1`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`. If `i` is not in `h`, then `h[i]` is set to 1 and `ans` is equal to `n`. `ams` is equal to `k - 1`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, `h`, and `ans` remain the same as in the initial state, because the given code does not modify these variables. However, a new variable `ams` is introduced and assigned the value of `k - 1`.
