Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. If `i` is already in the dictionary `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1 and `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`. If `i` is not in the dictionary `h`, then `i` is added to the dictionary `h` with a frequency of 1 and `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` was less than `k` before the code was executed, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`.**
