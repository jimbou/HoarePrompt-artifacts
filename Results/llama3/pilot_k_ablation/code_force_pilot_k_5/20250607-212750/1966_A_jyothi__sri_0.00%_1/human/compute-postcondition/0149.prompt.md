Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the input, h is an empty dictionary, ans is equal to n
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is equal to `n`. The dictionary `h` contains the first integer from the list `a` as a key. If the first integer `i` in the list `a` was already a key in the dictionary `h`, then its value is one more than its initial value. Otherwise, the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is 1. If the current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`. If the value of the first integer `i` in the list `a` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`, and `h` is a dictionary with the first integer from the list `a` as a key. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary with the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key and its value is 1, `ams` is not defined, and `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary with either the first integer from the list `a` as a key (if its value is greater than or equal to `k`) or the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key (otherwise), and the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is either increased by 1 if `i` is already in `h`, or `h` also has `i` as a key with a value of 1 if `i` is not in `h`. If the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ams` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 4 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary with either the first integer from the list `a` as a key (if its value is greater than or equal to `k`) or the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key (otherwise). If `i` is already in `h`, the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, `h` also has `i` as a key with a value of 1. If the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ams` is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 5 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the fifth integer in the list `a`. `h` is a dictionary with either the first integer from the list `a` as a key (if its value is greater than or equal to `k`) or the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key (otherwise). If `i` is already in `h`, the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, `h` also has `i` as a key with a value of 1. If the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ams` is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
