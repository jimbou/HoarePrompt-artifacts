Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element in the list, and `h[i]` is 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of `h[i]` is now 1, where `i` is the second element in the list `a`.
