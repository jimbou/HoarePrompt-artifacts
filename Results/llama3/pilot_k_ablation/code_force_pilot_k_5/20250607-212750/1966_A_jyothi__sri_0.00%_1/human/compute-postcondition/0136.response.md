Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary with either the first integer from the list `a` as a key (if its value is greater than or equal to `k`) or the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key (otherwise), and the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is either increased by 1 if `i` is already in `h`, or `h` also has `i` as a key with a value of 1 if `i` is not in `h`. If the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ams` is not defined.***
