Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`, The dictionary `h` contains the first integer from the list `a` as a key. If the first integer `i` in the list `a` was already a key in the dictionary `h`, then its value is one more than its initial value. Otherwise, the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is 1. The current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`.**

In this output state, the variable `ams` has been assigned the value of `k-1`, which is one less than the second integer from the input. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still equal to the first integer from the input, `k` still equal to the second integer from the input, `a` still a list of integers from the input, `ans` still equal to `n`, and the dictionary `h` still containing the first integer from the list `a` as a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`.
