Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the first integer `i` in the list `a` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, `ams` is equal to `k - 1`, stdin contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `ams` has been updated to `k - 1`, while the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `h` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers.
