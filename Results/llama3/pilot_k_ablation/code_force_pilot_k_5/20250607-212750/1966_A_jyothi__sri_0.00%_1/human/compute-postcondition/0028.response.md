Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`. `h` is a dictionary where the next integer `j` in the list `a` is a key. If the value of `j` in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` is equal to `n`.***
