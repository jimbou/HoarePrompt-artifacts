Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list, ans is equal to n. The dictionary h contains the key i with a value that is 2 more than its previous value if i was already in h and its previous value was at least 1. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. If the value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined.***
