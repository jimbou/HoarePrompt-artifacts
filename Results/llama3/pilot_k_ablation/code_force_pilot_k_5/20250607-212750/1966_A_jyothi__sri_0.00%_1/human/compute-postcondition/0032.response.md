Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`. `h` is a dictionary where the next integer `j` in the list `a` is a key. If `i` is in `h`, then the value of `h[j]` is incremented by 1, and `ams` is equal to `k - 1` if the value of `h[j]` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ams` is equal to `n`. If `i` is not in `h`, then `h[i]` is 1, and `ams` is equal to `k - 1` if the value of `j` in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ams` is equal to `n`.***
