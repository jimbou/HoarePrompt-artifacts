Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in the list, `h[i]` is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. However, the value of `h[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the fifth element in the list `a`.
