To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `_` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one test case in `stdin`. Therefore, the state of `_` should be adjusted to be at least 1, and the state of `stdin` should be adjusted to contain at least one test case.

State: **`stdin` contains at least 1 test case, `_` is at least 1**
