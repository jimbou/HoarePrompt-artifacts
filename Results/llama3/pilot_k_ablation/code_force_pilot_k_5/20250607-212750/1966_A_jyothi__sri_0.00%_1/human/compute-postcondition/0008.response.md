Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `stdin` contains at least 1 test case minus 2 inputs: 2 integers and a list of integers. The first integer `i` in the list `a` is now a key in dictionary `h`. If `i` was already in `h`, its value in `h` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added to `h` with a value of 1. The current value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`***
