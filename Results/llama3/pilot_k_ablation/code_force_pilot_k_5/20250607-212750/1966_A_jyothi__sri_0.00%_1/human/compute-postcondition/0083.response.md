Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `i` is the first element in the list. If `i` is already a key in dictionary `h`, then the value of `i` in `h` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added as a key in `h` with a value of 1.***
