Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in the list. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary where the key `i` is mapped to the value 1. `ams` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `h` remain the same as in the initial state. A new variable `ams` is introduced, which is equal to `k - 1`.
