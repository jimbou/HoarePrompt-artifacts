According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, ans is equal to n. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 integer and the variable i is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, and the input is empty**
