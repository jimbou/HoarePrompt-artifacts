Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `ans` is equal to `n`, and the dictionary `h` contains the key `i` with a value of 1.**

In this output state, the value of `h[i]` is reset to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ams` is not defined because `h[i]` is now less than `k`.
