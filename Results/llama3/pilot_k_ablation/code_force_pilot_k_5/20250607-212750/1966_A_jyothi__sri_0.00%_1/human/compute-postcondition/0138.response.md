Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 4 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`, `h` is a dictionary with either the first integer from the list `a` as a key (if its value is greater than or equal to `k`) or the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key (otherwise), and the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is increased by 1, and if the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` has been increased by 1. If the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ams` is not defined. The values of the other variables are not affected.
