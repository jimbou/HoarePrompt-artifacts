Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the input, h is an empty dictionary, ans is equal to n
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `i` is the first element in the list. If the value of `i` in dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ams`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element in the list. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h[i]` is set to 1. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k - 1`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list. If `i` is in `h` and `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is `k-1`. In any case, if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `h`, then the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary `h` where the key is `i` and the value is 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in the list. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h` is a dictionary where the key `i` is mapped to the value 1. If the value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is an integer equal to `k - 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
