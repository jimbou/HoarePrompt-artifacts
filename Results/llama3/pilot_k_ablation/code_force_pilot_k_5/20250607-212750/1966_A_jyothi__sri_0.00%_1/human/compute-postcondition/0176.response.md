Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in the list, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the value of `i` is 1 more than its previous value if `i` was already in `h` and its previous value was at least 1, otherwise, `h` contains `i` as a key with 1 as its value, and if the value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`, otherwise, `ams` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The dictionary `h` now contains the key `i` with a value that is 1 more than its previous value if `i` was already in `h` and its previous value was at least 1, otherwise, `h` contains `i` as a key with 1 as its value. The value of `ams` is still dependent on the value of `h[i]` and `k`.
