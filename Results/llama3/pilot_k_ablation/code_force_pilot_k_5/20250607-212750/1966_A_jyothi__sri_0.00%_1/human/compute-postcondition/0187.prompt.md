Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input, h is an empty dictionary, ans is equal to n, and ams is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    if i in h:
        h[i] += 1
    else:
        h[i] = 1
    if h[i] >= k:
        ams = k - 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, ans is equal to n, and the dictionary h contains the key i with a value that is 1 more than its previous value if i was already in h. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. If the value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in the list, ans is equal to n. The dictionary h contains the key i with a value that is 2 more than its previous value if i was already in h and its previous value was at least 1. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. If the value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 3 integers, i is the third integer in the list, ans is equal to n. The dictionary h contains the key i with a value that is 2 more than its previous value if i was already in h and its previous value was at least 1. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. If the value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 4 integers, i is the fourth integer in the list, ans is equal to n. The dictionary h contains the key i with a value that is 2 more than its previous value if i was already in h and its previous value was at least 1. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. If the value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 5 integers, i is the fifth integer in the list, ans is equal to n. If i is already in dictionary h and its previous value was at least 1, then h contains the key i with a value that is 2 more than its previous value. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. If the value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
