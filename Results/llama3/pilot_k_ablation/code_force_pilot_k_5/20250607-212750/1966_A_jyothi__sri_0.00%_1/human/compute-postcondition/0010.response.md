Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the first integer `i` in the list `a` is a key. If the value of `i` in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ams`.***
