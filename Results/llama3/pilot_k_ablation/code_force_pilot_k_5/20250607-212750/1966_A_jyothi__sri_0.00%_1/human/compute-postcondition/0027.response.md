Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the next integer `j` in the list `a` is a key, `ams` is equal to `k - 1`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, and `h` remain unchanged from the initial state. However, the value of `ams` is now equal to `k - 1`, regardless of the values in the dictionary `h`.
