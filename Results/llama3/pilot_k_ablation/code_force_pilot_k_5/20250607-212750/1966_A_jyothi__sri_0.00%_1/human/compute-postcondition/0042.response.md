Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, the input is empty, and the current value of `i` is a key in the dictionary `h` with a frequency that is one more than its previous frequency.**

In this output state, the value of `h[i]` has been incremented by 1, indicating that the frequency of the integer `i` in the list `a` has increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
