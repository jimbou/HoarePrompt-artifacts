Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, except for the fourth integer `i` in the list `a` which has a frequency of 1, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `k-1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `k`, and the list `a` remains the same. The dictionary `h` is updated such that the frequency of the fourth integer `i` in the list `a` is now 1. The value of `ans` depends on the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` and the value of `k`. If the frequency of `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is `n` if the frequency of `i` is less than `k`, otherwise `ans` is `k-1`.
