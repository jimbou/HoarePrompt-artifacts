Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 integer, `ans` is equal to `n`. The dictionary `h` contains the first integer from the list `a` as a key. If the first integer `i` in the list `a` was already a key in the dictionary `h`, then its value is one more than its initial value. Otherwise, the value of `i` in the dictionary `h` is 1.***
