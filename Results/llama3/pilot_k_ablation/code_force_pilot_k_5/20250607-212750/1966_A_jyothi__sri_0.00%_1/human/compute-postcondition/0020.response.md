Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`. `h` is a dictionary where the next integer `j` in the list `a` is a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value of `j` in `h` is incremented by 1 and `ams` is equal to `k - 1` if the value of `j` in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ams` is equal to `n`. If `i` is not in `h`, `i` is a key with a value of 1 in `h` and `ams` is equal to `n` because the value of `i` in `h` is 1 which is less than `k`.***
