Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the fifth integer in the list `a`. If the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is equal to `k-1`. Otherwise, `ans` is equal to `n` if the frequency of `i` in the dictionary `h` is less than `k`.**
