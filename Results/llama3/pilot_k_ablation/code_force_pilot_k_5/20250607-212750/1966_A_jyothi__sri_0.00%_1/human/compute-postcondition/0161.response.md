Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list, ans is equal to n, ams is equal to k - 1, and the dictionary h contains the key i with a value that is 1 more than its previous value if i was already in h. Otherwise, h contains i as a key with 1 as its value. The current value of h[i] is greater than or equal to k.**

In this output state, the value of ams is now defined and is equal to k - 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The dictionary h still contains the key i with a value that is 1 more than its previous value if i was already in h, or 1 as its value if i was not in h. The current value of h[i] is still greater than or equal to k.
