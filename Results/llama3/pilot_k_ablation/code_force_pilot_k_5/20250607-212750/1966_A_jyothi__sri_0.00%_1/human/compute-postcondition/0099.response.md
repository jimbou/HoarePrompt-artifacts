To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `a` and `i`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 3 elements, and `i` is the third element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` must be the fourth element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list.**
