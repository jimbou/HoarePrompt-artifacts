Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list, `ams` is `k-1`, If `i` is already a key in the dictionary `h`, then the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary `h` where the key is `i` and the value is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains the same as the first integer from the input. The value of `k` also remains the same as the second integer from the input. The list `a` remains the same with at least 4 elements. The value of `i` is still the fourth element in the list. A new variable `ams` is introduced and its value is one less than `k`. The dictionary `h` remains the same with the key-value pair where the key is `i` and the value is either increased by 1 if `i` is already a key or a new key-value pair is added with the value 1.
