Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in the list. If `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is `k-1`. In any case, if `i` is already a key in the dictionary `h`, then the value of `h[i]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, a new key-value pair is added to the dictionary `h` where the key is `i` and the value is 1.***
