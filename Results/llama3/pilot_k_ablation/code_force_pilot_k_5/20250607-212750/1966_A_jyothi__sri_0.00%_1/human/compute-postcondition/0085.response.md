Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 1 element, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first element in the list, `h` is a dictionary where `i` is a key with a value greater than or equal to `k`, and `ams` is equal to `k - 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `ans`, `i`, and `h` remain unchanged. A new variable `ams` is introduced and assigned the value of `k - 1`.
