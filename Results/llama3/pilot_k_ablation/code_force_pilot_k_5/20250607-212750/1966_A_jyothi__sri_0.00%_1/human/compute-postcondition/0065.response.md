Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`, `ams` is equal to `k-1`.**

In this output state, the value of `ams` is now equal to `k-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has at least 4 integers, and the dictionary `h` still contains the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The value of `i` is still the fourth integer in the list `a`. The value of `n` and `k` are still integers.
