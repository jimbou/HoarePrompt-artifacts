Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the first integer in the list `a`, the input is empty. If `i` is already a key in the dictionary `h`, its frequency is increased by 1. Otherwise, `i` is added as a key in the dictionary `h` with a frequency of 1.**
