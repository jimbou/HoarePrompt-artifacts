Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n <= 100, 2 <= k <= 100). The second line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 <= c_i <= 100).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    h = {}
    ans = n
    for i in a:
        if i in h:
            h[i] += 1
        else:
            h[i] = 1
        if h[i] >= k:
            ams = k - 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is an integer, a is an empty list, ans is equal to n, h is a dictionary where each integer i in the original list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer in the original list a, ams is equal to k - 1 if any value in h is greater than or equal to k, otherwise ams is equal to n, and the value of ans which is equal to n is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is an empty list, `h` is a dictionary where each integer i in the original list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the original list a, `ans` is equal to `k-1` if any frequency in the dictionary `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is equal to `n`, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is an empty list, h is a dictionary where each key is an integer from the input and the value is the number of times the integer appears in the input, ans is equal to k - 1 if any integer from the input appears at least k times, otherwise ans is equal to n, and the value of ans is printed which is either k - 1 or n depending on whether any integer from the input appears at least k times or not

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is an empty list of integers from the input, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary with all integers from the list `a` as keys and their respective counts as values, and `ams` is equal to `k-1` if any count in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, and the value of `ans` which is equal to `n` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, k is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, a is an empty list, i is the last integer in the list, ans is equal to n. The dictionary h contains all integers from the list as keys with their respective counts as values. If the count of any integer is greater than or equal to k, then ams is equal to k - 1. Otherwise, ams is not defined. and the value of ans which is equal to n is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
