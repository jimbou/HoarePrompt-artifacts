The code `h[i] += 1` increments the value of the key `i` in the dictionary `h` by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `h` is a dictionary that contains the key `i` with a value that is 1 more than its previous value, `ans` is equal to `n`, and `ams` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `ans` remain the same as before. The dictionary `h` still contains the key `i`, but its value has been incremented by 1. The variable `ams` is still not defined.
