Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 elements, `ans` is equal to `n`, `i` is the second element in the list. If `i` is in `h`, then `h[i]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `h[i]` is set to 1.***
