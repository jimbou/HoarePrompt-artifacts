Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the second input that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the value of key `i` is 2 more than its previous value if `i` was already in `h`. Otherwise, `h` contains `i` as a key with 2 as its value. If the value of `h[i]` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` is not defined.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The dictionary `h` now has the value of key `i` incremented by 1. If `i` was already in `h`, its value is now 2 more than its previous value; otherwise, its value is 2. The value of `ams` depends on the value of `h[i]`: if it's greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`; otherwise, `ams` is not defined.
