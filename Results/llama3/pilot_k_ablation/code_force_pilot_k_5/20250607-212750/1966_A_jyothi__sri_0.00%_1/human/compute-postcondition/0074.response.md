The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined based on the frequencies of integers in the original list `a` and the values of `n` and `k`.

Since `a` is an empty list, the dictionary `h` will also be empty, meaning there are no frequencies greater than or equal to `k`. Therefore, `ans` will be equal to `n`.

Output: **n**
