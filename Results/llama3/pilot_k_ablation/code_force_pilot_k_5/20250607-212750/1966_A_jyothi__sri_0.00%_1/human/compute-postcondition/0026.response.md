Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`. `h` is a dictionary where the next integer `j` in the list `a` is a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value of `j` in `h` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, a new key-value pair is added to `h` with `i` as the key and 1 as the value. If the value of `j` in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, `ams` is equal to `n`.**
