Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary where the next integer `j` in the list `a` is a key. If `i` is in `h`, the value of `j` in `h` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `h`, the value of `i` in `h` is set to 1. If the value of `j` in `h` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `ams` is equal to `k - 1`. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ams`.***
