Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, h is a dictionary where each integer i in the list a is a key, and the value of each key is the frequency of the integer i in the list a, ans is equal to n, and the input is empty**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are updated to the input values. The list `a` is populated with the input integers. The dictionary `h` is created to store the frequency of each integer in the list `a`. The value of `ans` remains equal to `n`. The input is empty after reading the values for `n`, `k`, and the list `a`.
