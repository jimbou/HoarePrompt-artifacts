Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, `k` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input that must have at least 2 integers, `ans` is equal to `n`, `h` is a dictionary with the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key and its value is 1, `ams` is not defined, `i` is the second integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `h[i]` is reset to 1, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The dictionary `h` now only contains the second integer `i` from the list `a` as a key, and its value is 1. The variables `ams` is not defined in this state.
