This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers, n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function then counts the occurrences of each integer in the second line and prints the total number of integers, n, if any integer appears at least k times. If no integer appears at least k times, the function still prints the total number of integers, n.
