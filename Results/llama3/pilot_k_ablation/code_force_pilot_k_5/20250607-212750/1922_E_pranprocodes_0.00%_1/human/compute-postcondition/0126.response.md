Postcondition: ***`t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 4, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` starts with the original `max` value, and `max` is decreased by 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` is prepended with the original `min` value, and `min` is increased by 1.***
