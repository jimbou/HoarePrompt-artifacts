Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and then t integers (2 ≤ X ≤ 10^18).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    x = int(input())
    max = 100000000
    min = -100000000
    ans = ''
    t = 0
    while x != 1:
        if x % 2 == 0:
            ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
            max -= 1
            x = x // 2
        else:
            ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
            min += 1
            x -= 1
        t += 1
    print(t)
    print(*ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input, x is 1, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value if the original value of x is a power of 2, otherwise ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times x is halved if the original value of x is a power of 2, otherwise max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times x is halved plus 1 if the original value of x is greater than 2, otherwise max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, min is 2 if the original value of x is greater than 1, otherwise min is 3, and the value of t which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 is being printed, and the string ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, `max` is the original max value minus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was even, `min` is the original min value plus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was odd, and the current value of `t` which is a positive integer is being printed, and the string `ans` containing the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were updated, `max` is either 99999995 or 99999996 if `x` was even and even, or 99999996 or 99999997 if `x` was even and odd, or 99999996 or 99999997 if `x` was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if `x` was odd and odd, `min` is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if `x` was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if `x` was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if `x` was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if `x` was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, and the number of times the loop executes which is `t` is being printed, and the values of max and min in the order they were updated are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, i is 3, x is 1, ans is a string of the original max value followed by a space and then the original min value, max is less than its original value, min is greater than its original value, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, and the value of t which is the number of times the loop executes plus 1 is being printed, and the original max and min values are being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `i` is 4, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of numbers from `min` to -1, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs, and the number of times the loop executes which is equal to `t` is being printed, and the sequence of numbers from -100000000 to -1 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
