Postcondition: ***t is 4, i is 1. If x is even, x is halved, max is decreased by 2, min is 1, and ans is a string containing the value of max followed by a space and its original value. If x is odd, if x is not equal to 1, x is decreased by 2, min is 2, and ans is a string containing the value of min followed by a space and its original value. Otherwise, ans is 'max' + ' ' + its original value, max is its original value minus 1.***
