Output State: **`t` is 4, `i` is 1, if `x` is even, `ans` is 'max' + ' ' + its original value, `max` is its original value minus 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1, `min` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `min` followed by a space and its original value.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 4. The values of `i`, `x`, `max`, `min`, and `ans` are not affected by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
