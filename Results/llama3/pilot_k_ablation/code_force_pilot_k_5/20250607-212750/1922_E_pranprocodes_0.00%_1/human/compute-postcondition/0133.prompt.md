Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, i is 3, x is an integer, ans is an empty string, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 2, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` contains the original max value followed by a space, and `max` is 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` contains the original min value, and `min` is -99999999.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 3, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is half of its original value, `ans` starts with the original value of `max` followed by a space and then the original value of `ans`, and `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is one less than its original value, `ans` is equal to `min` followed by a space and its original value, and `min` is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 4, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` starts with the original value of `max` followed by a space and the original value of `ans`, `max` is one less than its original value, and `min` remains unchanged. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` starts with the original value of `min` followed by a space and then the original value of `ans`, and `min` is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 5, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` starts with the original `max` value, and `max` is decreased by 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` is prepended with the original `min` value, and `min` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 6, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not 0, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` starts with the original `max` value followed by its original value, and `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` is the concatenation of the string representation of `min` and the original value of `ans`, and `min` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
