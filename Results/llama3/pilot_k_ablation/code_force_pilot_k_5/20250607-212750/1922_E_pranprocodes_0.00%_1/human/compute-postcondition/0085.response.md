Output State: **t is 2, i is 2, x is either half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer minus 1 if it was even, or one less than its original value minus 1 if it was odd and x is not equal to 1, ans is a string starting with either 99999999 or 100000000 followed by its original content if x was even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended twice if x was odd, max is either 99999998 or 99999999 if x was even, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 2, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been decremented by 1, and the string `ans` has been prepended with the value of `min` once more. The value of `min` has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
