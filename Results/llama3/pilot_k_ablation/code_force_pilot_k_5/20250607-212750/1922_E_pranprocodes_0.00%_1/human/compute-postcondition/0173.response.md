Output State: **t is the number of times the loop executes, i is t-1, x is 1, ans is a string containing the sequence of numbers from min to -1, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, and stdin contains no integer inputs.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `t` will be equal to the number of times the loop was executed, `i` will be one less than `t`, `x` will be 1, `ans` will be a string containing the sequence of numbers from -100000000 to -1, `max` will be reset to its original value of 100000000, `min` will be reset to its original value of -100000000, and there will be no integer inputs left in `stdin`.
