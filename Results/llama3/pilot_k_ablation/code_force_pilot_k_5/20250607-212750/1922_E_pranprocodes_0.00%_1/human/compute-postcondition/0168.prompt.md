Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, i is 4, x is an integer from stdin, ans is an empty string, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `i` is 4, `x` is an integer, `ans` is a string, `max` is an integer, `min` is an integer, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` is '100000000 ', and `max` is 99999999. If `x` is odd, `x` is decremented by 1, `ans` is '-100000000 ', and `min` is -99999999.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If x is even, x is halved, ans is prepended with the original value of max, max is decreased by 1, and min remains unchanged. If x is odd, x is decreased by 1, ans starts with the original value of min followed by a space and the original value of ans, min is increased by 1, and the number of integer inputs in stdin remains the same.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs, `x` is not 1. If `x` is even, `ans` is a string containing the original value of `ans` with 'max' prepended, `max` is one less than its original value, and `x` is half of its original value. If `x` is odd, `ans` is a string that starts with the string representation of the original value of `min`, followed by a space and the original value of `ans`, `min` is one more than its original value, and `x` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `t` is 4, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If x is even, x is divided by 2 and ans is a string that contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is max minus 1. If x is odd, x is one less than its original value, ans is a string containing the string 'min' and a space and the original value of ans, min is one more than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `t` is 5, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, and `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `min` is greater than its original value by 1, and `ans` is a string that contains the original value of `ans` with 'min' and a space prepended to it.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
