Output State: `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `i` is 4, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of numbers from `max` to 1 if `x` is even, or from `min` to -1 if `x` is odd, `max` is 100000000, `min` is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` will be equal to the number of times the loop executes, `i` remains unchanged at 4, `x` will be 1, `ans` will contain a sequence of numbers starting from either `max` (100000000) if `x` is even or `min` (-100000000) if `x` is odd, and the sequence will end at 1 or -1 respectively. The values of `max` and `min` remain unchanged at 100000000 and -100000000 respectively. The state of stdin also remains unchanged, containing at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs.
