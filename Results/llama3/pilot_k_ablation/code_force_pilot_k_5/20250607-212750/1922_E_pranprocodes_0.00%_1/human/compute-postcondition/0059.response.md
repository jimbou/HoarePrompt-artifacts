Output State: **t is 4, i is 1, x is half of its original value, max is its original value minus 2, min is 1, ans is a string containing the value of max followed by a space and its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `x` has been halved due to the operation `x = x // 2`. The value of `max` has been decremented by 1 due to the operation `max -= 1`. The value of `ans` has been updated to include the value of `max` followed by a space and its original value, as per the operation `ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans`. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, as they are not modified by the code. The value of `min` remains 1, as it is not modified by the code.
