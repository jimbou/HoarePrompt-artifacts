The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is a positive integer greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is 4, `i` is 0, `x` is a positive integer greater than 1. If `x` is even, `x` is equal to half of its original value, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, `min` is 2. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1, `ans` is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 if `x` is originally greater than 2, otherwise `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `min` is 4 if `x` is originally greater than 1, otherwise `min` is 3.**
