Output State: **t is 0, i is 2, x is an even number not equal to 1 divided by 2, ans is a string containing the original max value followed by a space, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the value of `max` followed by a space to `ans`. Since `max` is 100000000, `ans` becomes '100000000 '. The second line decrements `max` by 1, making `max` equal to 99999999. The third line divides `x` by 2. Since `x` is an even number not equal to 1, `x` becomes an even number not equal to 1 divided by 2. No other variables are affected.
