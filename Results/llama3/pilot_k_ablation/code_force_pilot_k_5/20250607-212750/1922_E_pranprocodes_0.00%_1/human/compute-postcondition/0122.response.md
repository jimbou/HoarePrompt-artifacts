Output State: **`t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 4, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` starts with the original value of `max` followed by a space and the original value of `ans`, `max` is one less than its original value, and `min` remains unchanged. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` starts with the original value of `min` followed by a space and then the original value of `ans`, and `min` is one more than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` being even or odd still apply, and the stdin still contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
