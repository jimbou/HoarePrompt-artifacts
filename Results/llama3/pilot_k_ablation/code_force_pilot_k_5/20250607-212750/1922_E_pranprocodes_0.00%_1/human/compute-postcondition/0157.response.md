The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x.  If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is either half of its original value or one less than its original value. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must not be equal to 1.
State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs, `x` is not 1**
