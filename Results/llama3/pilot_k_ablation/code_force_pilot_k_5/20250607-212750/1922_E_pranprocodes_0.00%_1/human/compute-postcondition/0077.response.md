Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2 and `ans` contains the original `max` value followed by a space. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` contains the original value of `min` followed by a space and the original value of `ans`, and `min` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged. The conditions related to `x` being even or odd and their effects on `x`, `ans`, and `min` are still applicable. The number of integer inputs in stdin has not changed.
