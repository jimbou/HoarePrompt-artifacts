Output State: **t is 3, i is 1, x is equal to its original value minus 1, min is 1, ans is a string containing the value of min followed by a space and its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is decremented by 1, so it becomes its original value minus 1. The value of `min` is incremented by 1, making it 1. The value of `ans` is a string containing the value of `min` followed by a space and its original value.
