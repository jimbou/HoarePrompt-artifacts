According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is not equal to 1. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not 0 (since 0 is also not equal to 1 but will cause an infinite loop if `x` is halved in the loop body). No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 5, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not 0, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.**
