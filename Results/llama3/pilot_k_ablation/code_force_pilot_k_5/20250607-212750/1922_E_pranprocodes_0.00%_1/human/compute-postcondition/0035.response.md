Output State: **t is 0, i is 1, x is an integer, ans is an empty string, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input**

The code snippet first assigns the integer value of the input to `x`, reducing the number of inputs in stdin by one. Then, it resets the values of `max` and `min` to 100000000 and -100000000, respectively, regardless of their original values. The variable `ans` is also reset to an empty string, discarding its original value. Finally, the value of `t` is set to 0, and the value of `i` remains unchanged at 1.
