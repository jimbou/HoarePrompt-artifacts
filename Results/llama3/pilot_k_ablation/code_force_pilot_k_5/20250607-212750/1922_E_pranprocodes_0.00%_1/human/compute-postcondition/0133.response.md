Output State: **t is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, i is 3, x is 1, ans is a string of the original max value followed by a space and then the original min value, max is less than its original value, min is greater than its original value, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` is equal to the number of times the loop executes plus 1, `i` remains unchanged at 3, `x` becomes 1, `ans` is a string that starts with the original maximum value followed by a space and then the original minimum value, `max` is less than its original value, `min` is greater than its original value, and the standard input contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
