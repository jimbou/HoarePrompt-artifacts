Based on the precondition, the code `print(*ans)` will print the string `ans`, which contains the original maximum value followed by a space and then the original minimum value.

Since `max` is less than its original value and `min` is greater than its original value, it implies that the original maximum and minimum values have been updated. However, the string `ans` still holds the original maximum and minimum values.

Therefore, the output will be the original maximum value, followed by a space, and then the original minimum value.

Output: **the original maximum value, followed by a space, and then the original minimum value**
