Postcondition: ***t is the number of times the loop executes plus 3, i is 3, x is not equal to 1, ans is a string, max and min are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If x is even, x is halved, ans starts with the original value of max followed by a space and the original value of ans, max is one less than its original value, and min remains unchanged. If x is odd, x is decreased by 1, ans starts with the original value of min followed by a space and then the original value of ans, and min is one more than its original value.***
