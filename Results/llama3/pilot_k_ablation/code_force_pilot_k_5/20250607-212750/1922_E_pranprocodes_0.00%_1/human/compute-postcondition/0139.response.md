Output State: **t is 0, i is 4, x is an integer from stdin, ans is an empty string, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs**

In this output state, the value of `t` is reset to 0, `i` remains unchanged at 4, and `x` is updated to the integer value read from stdin. The variables `max` and `min` are reset to their maximum and minimum possible values, respectively. The variable `ans` is reset to an empty string. The number of integer inputs in stdin is reduced by at least one due to the execution of the code.
