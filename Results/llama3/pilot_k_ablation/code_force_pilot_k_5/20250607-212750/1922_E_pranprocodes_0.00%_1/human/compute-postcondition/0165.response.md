Postcondition: ***`t` is 4, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, and `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `min` is greater than its original value by 1, and `ans` is a string that contains the original value of `ans` with 'min' and a space prepended to it.***
