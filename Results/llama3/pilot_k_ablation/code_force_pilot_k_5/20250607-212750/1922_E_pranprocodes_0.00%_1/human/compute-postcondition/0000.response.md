To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`. The loop will execute as long as there is at least one integer input available from `stdin`. Since the first input is an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1.

State: **stdin contains at least one integer input `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000), `i` is 0**
