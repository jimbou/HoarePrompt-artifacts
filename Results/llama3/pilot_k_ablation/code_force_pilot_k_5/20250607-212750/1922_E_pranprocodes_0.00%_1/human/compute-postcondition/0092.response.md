Output State: **`t` is 4, `i` is 2, if x is even, x is half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer, ans is a string starting with either 99999997 or 99999998 followed by its original content if x was even and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was even and odd, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended twice if x was odd and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was odd and odd, max is either 99999996 or 99999997 if x was even and even, or 99999997 or 99999998 if x was even and odd, or 99999997 or 99999998 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if x was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If x is odd, x is either a quarter of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and even, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and odd, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer minus 1 if it was odd and even, or one less than its original value minus 1 if it was odd and odd and x is not equal to 1, ans is a string starting with either 99999998 or 99999999 followed by its original content if x was even and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was even and odd, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended twice if x was odd and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was odd and odd, max is either 99999997 or 99999998 if x was even and even, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was even and odd, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if x was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, and min is incremented by 1, and x is decremented by 1, and ans is prepended with the string 'min' and a space.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is incremented by 1, resulting in `t` being 4. The values of `i`, `x`, `ans`, `max`, `min`, and stdin remain unchanged.
