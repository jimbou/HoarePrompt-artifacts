The `print(*ans)` statement will print the string `ans` without the square brackets and quotes, and the comma separation between the elements will be replaced by a space.

Since `ans` is a string containing the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, the output will be a sequence of the original max value or the original min value, separated by spaces.

The number of times the original max value or the original min value is printed is equal to the number of iterations of the loop, which is determined by the value of `t`.

The original max value is the original max value minus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was even, and the original min value is the original min value plus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was odd.

Since the exact values of the original max value, the original min value, and the number of times the loop executed when `x` was even or odd are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the output.

However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output a sequence of the original max value or the original min value, separated by spaces, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop.

Output: **the original max value or the original min value, separated by spaces, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop (where the original max value is the original max value minus the number of times the loop executed when x was even, and the original min value is the original min value plus the number of times the loop executed when x was odd)**
