The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, x is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to x is not equal to 1.

State: **stdin contains at least one integer input, i is 0, x is not equal to 1, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, t is 0**
