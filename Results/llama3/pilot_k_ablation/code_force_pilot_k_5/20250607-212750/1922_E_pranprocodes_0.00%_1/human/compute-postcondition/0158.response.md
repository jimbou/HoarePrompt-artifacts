Output State: **t is 3, i is 4, x is x divided by 2, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs, ans is a string that contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is max minus 1**

Explanation: The first line assigns the string 'max' followed by a space and the original value of `ans` to `ans`. The second line decrements `max` by 1. The third line divides `x` by 2. The values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged. The number of integer inputs in stdin remains at least one less than the current number of integer inputs.
