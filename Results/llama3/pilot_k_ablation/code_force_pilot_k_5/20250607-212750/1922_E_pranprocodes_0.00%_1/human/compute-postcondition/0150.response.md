Postcondition: ***t is 1, i is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If x is even, x is halved, ans is prepended with the original value of max, max is decreased by 1, and min remains unchanged. If x is odd, x is decreased by 1, ans starts with the original value of min followed by a space and the original value of ans, min is increased by 1, and the number of integer inputs in stdin remains the same.***
