Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input, and the values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `x` depend on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `ans` is '100000000 ', `max` is 99999999, and `x` is halved. If `x` is odd, `ans` is '-100000000 ', and `min` is -99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, while the values of `i`, `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `x` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains at least one integer input. The values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `x` are still dependent on whether `x` is even or odd, and their values are updated accordingly.
