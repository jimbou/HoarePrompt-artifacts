Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, i is 2, x is an integer, ans is an empty string, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is divided by 2 and `ans` contains the original `max` value followed by a space. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` contains the original value of `min` followed by a space and the original value of `ans`, and `min` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is either half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even, or one less than its original value if it was odd, `ans` is a string starting with either 99999999 or 100000000 followed by its original content if `x` was even, or equal to its original value with `min` prepended if `x` was odd, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 if `x` was even, `min` is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is 3, i is 2, x is either a quarter of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and even, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and odd, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer minus 1 if it was odd and even, or one less than its original value minus 1 if it was odd and odd and x is not equal to 1, ans is a string starting with either 99999998 or 99999999 followed by its original content if x was even and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was even and odd, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended twice if x was odd and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was odd and odd, max is either 99999997 or 99999998 if x was even and even, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was even and odd, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if x was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `t` is 4, `i` is 2, if x is even, x is half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer, ans is a string starting with either 99999997 or 99999998 followed by its original content if x was even and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was even and odd, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended twice if x was odd and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was odd and odd, max is either 99999996 or 99999997 if x was even and even, or 99999997 or 99999998 if x was even and odd, or 99999997 or 99999998 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if x was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If x is odd, x is either a quarter of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and even, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and odd, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer minus 1 if it was odd and even, or one less than its original value minus 1 if it was odd and odd and x is not equal to 1, ans is a string starting with either 99999998 or 99999999 followed by its original content if x was even and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was even and odd, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended twice if x was odd and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was odd and odd, max is either 99999997 or 99999998 if x was even and even, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was even and odd, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if x was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, and min is incremented by 1, and x is decremented by 1, and ans is prepended with the string 'min' and a space.

If x is odd, x is either a quarter of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and even, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even and odd, or half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer minus 1 if it was odd and even, or one less than its original value minus 1 if it was odd and odd and x is not equal to 1, ans is a string starting with either 99999998 or 99999999 followed by its original content if x was even and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was even and odd, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended twice if x was odd and even, or equal to its original value with 'min' prepended if x was odd and odd, max is either 99999997 or 99999998 if x was even and even, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was even and odd, or 99999998 or 99999999 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if x was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if x was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if x was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, and min is incremented by 1, and x is decremented by 1, and ans is prepended with the string 'min' and a space, and x is not equal to 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
