According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is an integer. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to x is not equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 4, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` is an integer, `min` is an integer, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs.**
