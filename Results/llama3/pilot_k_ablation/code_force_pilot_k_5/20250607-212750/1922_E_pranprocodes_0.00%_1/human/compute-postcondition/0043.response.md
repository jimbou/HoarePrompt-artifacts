The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is either half its original value (if it was even) or one less than its original value (if it was odd). In either case, x is not equal to 1, so it needs to be adjusted to be not equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input, `x` is not equal to 1**
