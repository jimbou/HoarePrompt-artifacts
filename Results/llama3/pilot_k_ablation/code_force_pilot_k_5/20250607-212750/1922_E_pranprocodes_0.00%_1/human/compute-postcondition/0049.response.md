Output State: **t is 2, i is 1, ans is a string containing the original max value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, max is one less than its original value, x is half of its original value**

Explanation:

* The first line of the code appends the original max value to the beginning of the string `ans`. Since `ans` originally contained either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, the updated `ans` will now contain the original max value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space.
* The second line decrements the value of `max` by 1. Therefore, the final value of `max` will be one less than its original value.
* The third line performs integer division of `x` by 2. Since `x` is not equal to 1, the result of this division will be half of the original value of `x`.

Note that the values of `t` and `i` are not modified by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state.
