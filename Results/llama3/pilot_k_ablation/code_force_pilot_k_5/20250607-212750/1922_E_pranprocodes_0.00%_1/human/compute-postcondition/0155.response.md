Postcondition: **`t` is 2, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs, `x` is not 1. If `x` is even, `ans` is a string containing the original value of `ans` with 'max' prepended, `max` is one less than its original value, and `x` is half of its original value. If `x` is odd, `ans` is a string that starts with the string representation of the original value of `min`, followed by a space and the original value of `ans`, `min` is one more than its original value, and `x` is one less than its original value.**
