Output State: `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the sequence of numbers from `max` to 1 in descending order, separated by spaces, `max` is 1, `min` is -100000000, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` will be equal to the number of times the loop executes, the variable `i` remains unchanged at 2, the variable `x` will be 1, the variable `ans` will contain a string of numbers from the original value of `max` (100000000) to 1 in descending order, separated by spaces, the variable `max` will be 1, the variable `min` will remain unchanged at -100000000, and the stdin will contain at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
