Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains at least one integer input, i is 0, x is an integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, t is 0
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input, and the values of `max`, `min`, `ans`, and `x` depend on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `ans` is '100000000 ', `max` is 99999999, and `x` is halved. If `x` is odd, `ans` is '-100000000 ', and `min` is -99999999.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input. If x is even, x is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. If x is odd, x is a number greater than 0, ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space, min is 2.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input. If x is even, x is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, min is 2. If x is odd, x is a number greater than 0, ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, min is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `t` is 4, `i` is 0, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0. If `x` is even, `x` is equal to half of its original value, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, `min` is 2. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1, `ans` is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 if `x` is originally greater than 2, otherwise `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `min` is 4 if `x` is originally greater than 1, otherwise `min` is 3.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is 5, i is 0, x is a positive integer. If x is even, x is equal to half of its original value, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, and min is 2. If x is odd, x is equal to its original value minus 1, ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 if x is originally greater than 2, otherwise max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, and min is 4 if x is originally greater than 1, otherwise min is 3.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
