Postcondition: ***`t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 5, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1 and `x` is not 0, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` starts with the original `max` value followed by its original value, and `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is decreased by 1, `ans` is the concatenation of the string representation of `min` and the original value of `ans`, and `min` is increased by 1.***
