According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is either half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even, or one less than its original value if it was odd. So for the loop to be executed one more time x must not be equal to 1. 
State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 2, `x` is either half of its original value rounded down to the nearest integer if it was even, or one less than its original value if it was odd and x is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string starting with either 99999999 or 100000000 followed by its original content if `x` was even, or equal to its original value with `min` prepended if `x` was odd, `max` is either 99999998 or 99999999 if `x` was even, `min` is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.**
