Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is 0, i is 1, x is an integer, ans is an empty string, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input
Code of the loop:
while x != 1:
    if x % 2 == 0:
        ans = f'{max}' + ' ' + ans
        max -= 1
        x = x // 2
    else:
        ans = f'{min}' + ' ' + ans
        min += 1
        x -= 1
    t += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input. If `x` is even, it is equal to half its original value, `max` is 99999999, and `min` is -100000000. If `x` is odd, it is one less than its original value, `max` is 100000000, and `min` is -99999999.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space. If `x` is even, `max` is one less than its original value, `x` is half of its original value. If `x` is odd, `min` is one more than its original value, `x` is one less than its original value. In both cases, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is 3, `i` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `ans` is a string containing the original max value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `max` is one less than its original value, and `x` is half of its original value. If `x` is odd, `ans` is a string containing the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `min` is the original min value plus 1, and `x` is the original value of `x` minus 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `t` is 4, `i` is 1, if `x` is even, `ans` is 'max' + ' ' + its original value, `max` is its original value minus 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1, `min` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `min` followed by a space and its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is 5, i is 1. If x is even, x is halved, max is decreased by 2, min is 1, and ans is a string containing the value of max followed by a space and its original value. If x is odd, if x is not equal to 1, x is decreased by 2, min is 2, and ans is a string containing the value of min followed by a space and its original value. Otherwise, ans is 'max' + ' ' + its original value, max is its original value minus 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
