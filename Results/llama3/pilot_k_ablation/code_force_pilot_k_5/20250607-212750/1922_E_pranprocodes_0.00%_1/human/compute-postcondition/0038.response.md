Output State: **t is 0, i is 1, x is an even number equal to half its original value, ans is a string containing the original max value followed by a space, max is 99999999, min is -100000000, stdin contains at least one less integer input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged. The value of `x` is halved due to the integer division by 2. The `ans` string now contains the original value of `max` followed by a space. The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The value of `min` remains unchanged. The number of integer inputs in `stdin` is reduced by at least one.
