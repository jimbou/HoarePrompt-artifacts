Output State: `t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, `max` is the original max value minus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was even, `min` is the original min value plus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was odd.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is a state where the loop counter `t` has reached a positive integer value, the variable `i` remains unchanged at 1, the variable `x` has reached 1, the string `ans` contains a sequence of the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop. The `stdin` contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. The `max` value has decreased by the number of times the loop executed when `x` was even, and the `min` value has increased by the number of times the loop executed when `x` was odd.
