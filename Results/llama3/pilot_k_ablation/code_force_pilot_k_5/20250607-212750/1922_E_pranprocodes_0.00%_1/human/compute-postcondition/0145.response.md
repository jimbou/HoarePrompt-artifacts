Postcondition: **t is 0, i is 4, x is an integer, ans is a string, max is an integer, min is an integer, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If x is even, x is halved, ans is '100000000 ', and max is 99999999. If x is odd, x is decremented by 1, ans is '-100000000 ', and min is -99999999.**
