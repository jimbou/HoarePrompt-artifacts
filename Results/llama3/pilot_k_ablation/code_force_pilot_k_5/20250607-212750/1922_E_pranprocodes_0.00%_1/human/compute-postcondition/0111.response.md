Postcondition: ***t is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, i is 3, x is not equal to 1, ans is a string, max and min are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If x is even, x is halved, ans contains the original max value followed by a space, and max is 99999999. If x is odd, x is decreased by 1, ans contains the original min value, and min is -99999999.***
