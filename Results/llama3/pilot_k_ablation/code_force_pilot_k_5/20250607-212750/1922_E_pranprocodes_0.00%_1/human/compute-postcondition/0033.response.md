Output: **t is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, i is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input, x is 1, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value if the original value of x is a power of 2, otherwise ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times x is halved if the original value of x is a power of 2, otherwise max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times x is halved plus 1 if the original value of x is greater than 2, otherwise max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, min is 2 if the original value of x is greater than 1, otherwise min is 3, and the value of t which is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 is being printed, and the string ans is being printed**
