Output: **`t` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, repeated a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs, `max` is the original max value minus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was even, `min` is the original min value plus the number of times the loop executed when `x` was odd, and the current value of `t` which is a positive integer is being printed**
