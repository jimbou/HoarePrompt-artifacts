The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is not equal to 1, so for the loop to be executed one more time x must still not be equal to 1.
State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 2, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` is either 99999999 or 100000000, `min` is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.**
