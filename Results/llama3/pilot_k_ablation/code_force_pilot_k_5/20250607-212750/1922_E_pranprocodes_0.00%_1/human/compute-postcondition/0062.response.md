Output State: **t is 5, i is 1. If x is even, x is halved, max is decreased by 2, min is 1, and ans is a string containing the value of max followed by a space and its original value. If x is odd, if x is not equal to 1, x is decreased by 2, min is 2, and ans is a string containing the value of min followed by a space and its original value. Otherwise, ans is 'max' + ' ' + its original value, max is its original value minus 1.**

The code increments the value of t by 1, so t is now 5. The value of i remains unchanged at 1. The conditions and values of x, max, min, and ans are still dependent on whether x is even or odd, and their values are not affected by the increment of t.
