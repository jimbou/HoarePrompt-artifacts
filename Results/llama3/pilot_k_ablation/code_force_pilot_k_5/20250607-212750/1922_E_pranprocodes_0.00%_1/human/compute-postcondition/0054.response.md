Output State: **t is 3, i is 1, x is not equal to 1, ans is 'max' + ' ' + its original value, max is its original value minus 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `x` is also not equal to 1 as it was in the initial state. The value of `ans` is modified by the first line of the code, which appends the string 'max' and a space to its original value. The value of `max` is decremented by 1 in the second line of the code.
