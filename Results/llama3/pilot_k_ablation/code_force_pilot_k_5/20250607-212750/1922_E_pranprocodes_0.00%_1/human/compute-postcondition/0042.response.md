Output State: **`t` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input. If `x` is even, it is equal to half its original value, `max` is 99999999, and `min` is -100000000. If `x` is odd, it is one less than its original value, `max` is 100000000, and `min` is -99999999.**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of `i`, `ans`, `stdin`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain the same as in the initial state.
