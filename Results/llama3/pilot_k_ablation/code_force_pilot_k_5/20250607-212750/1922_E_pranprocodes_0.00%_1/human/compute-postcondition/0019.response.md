According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is either a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value or a number greater than 0. In both cases, x is not equal to 1, so the loop can certainly execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is 3, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input. If x is even, x is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, min is 2. If x is odd, x is a number greater than 0, ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, min is 3.**
