Output State: **stdin contains at least one integer input, i is 0, x is an integer, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, ans is an empty string, t is 0**

The code assigns the value of the input integer to `x`, and sets `max` to 100000000, `min` to -100000000, `ans` to an empty string, and `t` to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. The state of stdin is updated to reflect that one integer input has been consumed.
