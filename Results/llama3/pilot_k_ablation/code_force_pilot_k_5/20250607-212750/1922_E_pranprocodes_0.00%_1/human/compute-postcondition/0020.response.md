Output State: **t is 3, i is 0, x is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value if x is even, otherwise x is a number greater than 0, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value if x is even, otherwise ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3, min is 3 if x is odd, otherwise min is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code. The value of `x` is halved if it is even, otherwise, it remains a number greater than 0. The value of `ans` is modified based on whether `x` is even or odd. If `x` is even, `ans` contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value. If `x` is odd, `ans` starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value. The value of `max` is decremented by 1. The value of `min` is 3 if `x` is odd, otherwise, it is 2.
