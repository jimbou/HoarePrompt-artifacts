Output State: **t is 2, i is 1, ans is a string containing the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, min is the original min value plus 1, x is the original value of x minus 1**

In this output state, the value of `t` and `i` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `ans` is modified by prepending the original min value followed by a space to the original string. The value of `min` is incremented by 1. The value of `x` is decremented by 1.
