Postcondition: ***t is 0, i is 2, x is not equal to 1, ans is a string, max is either 99999999 or 100000000, min is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If x is even, x is divided by 2 and ans contains the original max value followed by a space. If x is odd, x is decreased by 1, ans contains the original value of min followed by a space and the original value of ans, and min is increased by 1.***
