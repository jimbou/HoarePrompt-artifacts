Output State: **`t` is 5, `i` is 4, stdin contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is halved, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, and `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `min` is greater than its original value by 1, and `ans` is a string that contains the original value of `ans` with 'min' and a space prepended to it.**

The value of `t` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 5. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition on stdin remains the same, as it still contains at least one less integer input than the current number of integer inputs. The conditions on `x`, `ans`, `max`, and `min` also remain the same, as their values are not changed by the code.
