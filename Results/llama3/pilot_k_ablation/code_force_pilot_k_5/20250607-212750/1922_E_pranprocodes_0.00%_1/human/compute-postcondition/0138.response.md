To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the number of integer inputs in `stdin`. If `i` is less than the number of integer inputs in `stdin`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `stdin` contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Additionally, `stdin` must contain at least one more integer input than the current number of integer inputs.

The other variables `t`, `x`, `ans`, `max`, and `min` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, `i` is 4, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string of the original max value followed by a space and then the original min value, `max` is less than its original value, `min` is greater than its original value, and `stdin` contains at least one more integer input than the current number of integer inputs**
