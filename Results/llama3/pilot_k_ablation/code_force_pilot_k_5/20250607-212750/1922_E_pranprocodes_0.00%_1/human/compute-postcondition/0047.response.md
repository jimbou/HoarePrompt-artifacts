Output State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space. If `x` is even, `max` is one less than its original value, `x` is half of its original value. If `x` is odd, `min` is one more than its original value, `x` is one less than its original value. In both cases, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of `i`, `ans`, `x`, `max`, and `min` remain unchanged. The state of `stdin` also remains the same, containing at least one less integer input.
