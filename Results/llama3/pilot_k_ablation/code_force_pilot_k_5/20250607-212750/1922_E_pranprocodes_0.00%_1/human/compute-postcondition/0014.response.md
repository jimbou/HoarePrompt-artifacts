According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, x is either even or odd. If x is even, x is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value. If x is odd, x is a number greater than 0. In both cases, x is not equal to 1. So, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`t` is 2, `i` is 0, stdin contains at least one integer input. If x is even, x is a positive integer greater than 1 and equal to half of its original value, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1. If x is odd, x is a number greater than 0, ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space, min is 2.**
