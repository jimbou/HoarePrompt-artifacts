Postcondition: **`t` is 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is a string containing either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `stdin` contains at least one less integer input. If `x` is even, it is equal to half its original value, `max` is 99999999, and `min` is -100000000. If `x` is odd, it is one less than its original value, `max` is 100000000, and `min` is -99999999.**
