Output State: **t is 5, i is 0, x is a positive integer. If x is even, x is equal to half of its original value, ans is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 2, and min is 2. If x is odd, x is equal to its original value minus 1, ans is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 3 if x is originally greater than 2, otherwise max is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, and min is 4 if x is originally greater than 1, otherwise min is 3.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of t has been incremented by 1, so it is now 5. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
