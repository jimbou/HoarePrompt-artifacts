Postcondition: ***`t` is 2, `i` is 1, `x` is not equal to 1. If `x` is even, `ans` is a string containing the original max value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `max` is one less than its original value, and `x` is half of its original value. If `x` is odd, `ans` is a string containing the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space and then either the original max value or the original min value followed by a space, `min` is the original min value plus 1, and `x` is the original value of `x` minus 1.***
