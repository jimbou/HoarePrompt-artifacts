The only variable in the loop head is variable x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable x. If x is not equal to 1, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, x is an integer, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to x is not equal to 1.

State: **t is the number of times the loop executes plus 1, i is 3, x is not equal to 1, ans is an empty string, max is 100000000, min is -100000000, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.**
