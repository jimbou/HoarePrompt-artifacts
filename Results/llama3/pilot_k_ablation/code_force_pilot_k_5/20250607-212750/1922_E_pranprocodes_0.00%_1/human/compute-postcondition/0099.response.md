Output State: `t` is the number of times the loop executes, `i` is 2, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were updated, `max` is either 99999995 or 99999996 if `x` was even and even, or 99999996 or 99999997 if `x` was even and odd, or 99999996 or 99999997 if `x` was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if `x` was odd and odd, `min` is either -100000000 or its original value plus 1 if `x` was even and even, or its original value plus 1 if `x` was even and odd, or its original value plus 2 if `x` was odd and even, or its original value plus 1 if `x` was odd and odd, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` will be equal to the number of times the loop executes, `i` remains unchanged at 2, `x` will be 1, `ans` will be a string containing the values of `max` and `min` in the order they were updated, `max` and `min` will be updated based on the parity of `x` and the number of iterations, and stdin will contain at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs.
