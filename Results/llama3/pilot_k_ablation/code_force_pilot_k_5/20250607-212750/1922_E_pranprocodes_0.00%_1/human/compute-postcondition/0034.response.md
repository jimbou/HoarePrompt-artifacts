The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and t, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains at least one integer input, `x` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value if the original value of `x` is a power of 2, otherwise `ans` is a string that starts with 'min' and a space and contains the word 'max' followed by a space and its original value, `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times `x` is halved if the original value of `x` is a power of 2, otherwise `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus the number of times `x` is halved plus 1 if the original value of `x` is greater than 2, otherwise `max` is a positive integer equal to its original value minus 1, `min` is 2 if the original value of `x` is greater than 1, otherwise `min` is 3**
