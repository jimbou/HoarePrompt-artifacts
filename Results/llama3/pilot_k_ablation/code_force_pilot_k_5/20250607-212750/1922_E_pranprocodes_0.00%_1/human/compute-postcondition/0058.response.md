To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `x` so that it is not equal to 1.

State: **`t` is 4, `i` is 1, if `x` is even, `ans` is 'max' + ' ' + its original value, `max` is its original value minus 1. If `x` is odd, `x` is equal to its original value minus 1, `min` is 1, `ans` is a string containing the value of `min` followed by a space and its original value, `x` is not equal to 1**
