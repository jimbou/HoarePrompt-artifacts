Postcondition: ***`t` is the number of times the loop executes plus 2, `i` is 3, `x` is not equal to 1, `ans` is a string, `max` and `min` are integers, and stdin contains at least one less integer input than the original number of integer inputs. If `x` is even, `x` is half of its original value, `ans` starts with the original value of `max` followed by a space and then the original value of `ans`, and `max` is one less than its original value. If `x` is odd, `x` is one less than its original value, `ans` is equal to `min` followed by a space and its original value, and `min` is one more than its original value.***
