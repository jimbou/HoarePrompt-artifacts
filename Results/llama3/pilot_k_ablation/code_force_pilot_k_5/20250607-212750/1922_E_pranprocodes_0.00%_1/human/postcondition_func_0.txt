This function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer represents the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent integer (x) is a number to be processed. For each x, the function generates a sequence of numbers by repeatedly dividing x by 2 if it's even or subtracting 1 if it's odd, until x becomes 1. The function then prints the number of steps taken to reach 1 and the generated sequence of numbers. The function processes all test cases and does not return any value.
