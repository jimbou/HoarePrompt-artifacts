Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, based on the precondition, we know that `result` is the return value of `func_1` when called with the arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.

Therefore, the output will be the value returned by `func_1` when executed with the given inputs.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices) (where n, m, k, and prices are the input values)**
