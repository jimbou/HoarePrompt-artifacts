To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`, which means we can only adjust the state of `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be decreased by 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1, `_` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, `prices` is a list of n positive integers, `result` is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), `stdin` contains t-3 inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is being printed**
