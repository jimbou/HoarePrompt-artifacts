Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 2, _ is 1, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-6 inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is being printed**

The code block reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k. It then reads a list of n positive integers from stdin and assigns it to prices. Finally, it calls func_1 with the values of n, m, k, and prices, and assigns the return value to result. The value of t is decreased by 2 due to the two input operations. The value of _ remains unchanged. The values of n, m, k, and prices are updated based on the input values. The result of func_1 is being printed, but its value is not specified in the initial state, so it is not included in the output state.
