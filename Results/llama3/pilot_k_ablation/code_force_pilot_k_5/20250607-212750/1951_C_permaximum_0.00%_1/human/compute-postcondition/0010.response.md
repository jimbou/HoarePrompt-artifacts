Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 2, _ is 2, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-10 inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is being printed, the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is printed**

The code executes three lines that read input from stdin and assign values to variables. The first line reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k, respectively. The second line reads a list of n positive integers from stdin and assigns it to prices. The third line calls the function func_1 with the values of n, m, k, and prices as arguments and assigns the return value to result. 

After the code executes, the values of n, m, k, and prices are updated to the values read from stdin. The value of result is also updated to the return value of func_1. The value of t is decreased by 2, and the value of _ remains unchanged. The stdin contains t-10 inputs, and the result of func_1 is being printed.
