Output State: **t is an integer, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, and prices is a list of n positive integers, stdin contains t-1 inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of n positive integers.**

Explanation: The code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. This line affects the value of `t` and the state of the input buffer. The initial state of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` remains unchanged. The input buffer now contains `t-1` inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, and a list of `n` positive integers.
