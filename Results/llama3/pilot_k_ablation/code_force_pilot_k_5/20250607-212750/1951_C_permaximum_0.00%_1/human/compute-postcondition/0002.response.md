Output State: **t is greater than 0, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-2 inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of n positive integers.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of `prices` is updated to a new list of `n` positive integers, which is the result of the second line of code. The value of `result` is the return value of the function `func_1` called with the updated values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. The state of `stdin` is also updated, as two inputs have been consumed by the code.
