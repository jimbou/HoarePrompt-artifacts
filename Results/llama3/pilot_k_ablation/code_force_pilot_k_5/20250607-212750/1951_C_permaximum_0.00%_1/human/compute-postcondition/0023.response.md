Output State: **The program returns the total cost of all tickets bought, which is the sum of the cost of k tickets, where k is a positive integer less than or equal to the product of the number of positive integers in the prices list and a positive integer m.**

In this output state, the total cost is the sum of the cost of all tickets bought, which is equal to the number of tickets bought (k) multiplied by the cost of each ticket. The cost of each ticket is determined by the prices list, which is a sorted list of n positive integers. The number of tickets bought (k) is a positive integer less than or equal to the product of the number of positive integers in the prices list (n) and a positive integer m.
