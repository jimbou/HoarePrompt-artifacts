Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains no inputs, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is printed t times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable t will be 0, the loop counter _ will be equal to the initial value of t, the variables n, m, k, and prices will still be positive integers and a list of positive integers respectively, the result will be the return value of the function func_1 with the current values of n, m, k, and prices, the standard input will be empty, and the result of func_1 will be printed t times.
