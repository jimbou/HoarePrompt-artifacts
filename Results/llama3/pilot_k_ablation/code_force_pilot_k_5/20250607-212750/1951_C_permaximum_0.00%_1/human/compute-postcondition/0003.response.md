Based on the initial state, the print statement will print the value of the variable `result`, which is the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, we can describe the value of `result` based on the input parameters.

`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n*m`, and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers.

The function `func_1` takes these input parameters and returns a value, which is stored in the variable `result`.

Therefore, the print statement will print the value returned by `func_1` based on the input parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`.

Output: **the value returned by func_1(n, m, k, prices) (where n, m, k, and prices are the input parameters)**
