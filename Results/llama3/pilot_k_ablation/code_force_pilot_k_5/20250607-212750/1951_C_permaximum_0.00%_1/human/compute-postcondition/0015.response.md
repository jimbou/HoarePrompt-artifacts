Based on the precondition, the `print(result)` statement will print the return value of the function `func_1(n, m, k, prices)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of the result. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the result of the function call.

The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices` are used as inputs to the function `func_1`, and their values are not explicitly provided. However, we know that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n*m`, and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers.

Therefore, the output will be the result of the function `func_1` called with these input values.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) (where n, m, k, and prices are the input values)**
