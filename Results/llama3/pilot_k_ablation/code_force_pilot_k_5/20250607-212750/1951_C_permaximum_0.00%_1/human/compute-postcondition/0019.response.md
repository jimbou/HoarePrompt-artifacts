The code prints the result of the function `func_1` with arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. The result is printed four times.

Output: **the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) (where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, and prices is a list of n positive integers)**
