The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n*m`, and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of `n` positive integers. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and `_` is 0.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n*m`, and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of `n` positive integers.**
