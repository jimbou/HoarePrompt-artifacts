The code prints the return value of the function `func_1` with arguments `n`, `m`, `k`, and `prices`. The return value of `func_1` is stored in the variable `result`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `result`. However, based on the precondition, we know that `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n*m`, and `prices` is a list of `n` positive integers.

Therefore, the print statement will output the result of the function `func_1` with these specific inputs.

Output: **the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices) (where n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, and prices is a list of n positive integers)**
