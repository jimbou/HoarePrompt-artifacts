Output State: **t is greater than 0 and decreased by 2, _ is 3, n is a positive integer, m is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that k <= n*m, prices is a list of n positive integers, result is the return value of func_1(n, m, k, prices), stdin contains t-14 inputs: an integer, an integer, an integer, a list of n positive integers, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is being printed, the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is printed, and the result of func_1(n, m, k, prices) is printed**

The code reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to n, m, and k. It then reads a list of n positive integers from stdin and assigns it to prices. The function func_1 is called with these values and its return value is assigned to result. The result of func_1 is printed three times. After the code executes, the values of n, m, k, and prices are updated, and the result of func_1 is stored in result. The stdin contains t-14 inputs.
