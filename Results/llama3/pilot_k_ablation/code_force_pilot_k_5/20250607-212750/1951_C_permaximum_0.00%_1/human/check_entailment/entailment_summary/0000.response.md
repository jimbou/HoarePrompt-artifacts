Correctness: **False**

Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect because it does not correctly implement the problem's constraints. The problem states that if a person purchases x tickets on day i, all subsequent days will have their prices per ticket increased by x. However, the provided code does not take this into account.

In the func_1 function, the prices are sorted in ascending order, and then the function iterates over the sorted prices, buying as many tickets as possible on each day. However, this approach does not consider the fact that the prices will increase after each purchase.

To correctly solve the problem, the function should keep track of the current prices and update them after each purchase. It should also consider the maximum number of tickets that can be bought on each day (m) and the total number of tickets that need to be bought (k).

The func_2 function is correct in that it reads the input for multiple test cases and calls the func_1 function with the correct inputs. However, since the func_1 function is incorrect, the overall program is also incorrect.
