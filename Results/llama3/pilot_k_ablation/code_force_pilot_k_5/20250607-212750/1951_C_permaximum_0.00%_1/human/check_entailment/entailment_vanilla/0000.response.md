Reasoning:

The problem requires finding the minimum spending to purchase k tickets over n days, with a maximum of m tickets purchasable each day. The price per ticket for each day is given in the list prices. The problem also states that if x tickets are purchased on day i, the prices for all subsequent days will increase by x.

Function 1, func_1, attempts to solve this problem by sorting the prices list and then iterating over it. In each iteration, it calculates the number of tickets to buy on the current day (tickets_to_buy) as the minimum of m and the remaining number of tickets to buy (k - tickets_bought). It then calculates the cost of buying these tickets (cost) and adds it to the total cost. The function breaks out of the loop when all k tickets have been bought.

However, this function does not take into account the fact that the prices for subsequent days will increase by the number of tickets bought on the current day. This means that the function is not correctly modeling the problem, and its results will not be accurate.

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Correctness: **False**
