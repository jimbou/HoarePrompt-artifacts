Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem states that the price per ticket increases by x if x tickets are purchased on day i, but the program does not take this into account. The program simply sorts the prices and buys the minimum number of tickets at each price, without considering the increase in price due to previous purchases.

For example, consider the input:

3 2 4
1 2 3

The program will output 6, but the correct answer is 10. The correct sequence of purchases is:

* Buy 2 tickets on day 1 at price 1, total cost 2. Prices for remaining days become [3, 4].
* Buy 2 tickets on day 2 at price 3, total cost 6. Prices for remaining days become [5].
* The program does not consider the increase in price due to the previous purchases, and buys the remaining 0 tickets at price 5, which is incorrect.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description, and therefore, it is incorrect.
