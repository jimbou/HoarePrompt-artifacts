Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve a problem where the goal is to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets, given a list of prices per ticket for each of n days, and a maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (m).

Function 1, `func_1`, calculates the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. It sorts the prices list in ascending order and then iterates over the sorted list, buying the minimum number of tickets possible each day (either m or k - tickets_bought, whichever is smaller). The cost of the tickets bought each day is added to the total cost, and the number of tickets bought is updated. The function returns the total cost once k tickets have been bought.

Function 2, `func_2`, handles input and output for multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases (t), and then for each test case, it reads the number of sale days (n), the maximum number of tickets purchasable each day (m), the total number of tickets to buy (k), and the list of prices per ticket for each day. It then calls `func_1` with these inputs and prints the result.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets. The sorting of the prices list ensures that the cheapest tickets are bought first, which minimizes the total cost. The iteration over the sorted list and the updating of the total cost and the number of tickets bought ensure that the correct total cost is calculated.

However, there is a logical error in the program. The prices list is sorted in ascending order, but the problem statement says that the prices per ticket for each day are given in the order they will be sold. This means that the prices list should not be sorted, and the program should iterate over the original list instead of the sorted list.

Correctness: **False**
