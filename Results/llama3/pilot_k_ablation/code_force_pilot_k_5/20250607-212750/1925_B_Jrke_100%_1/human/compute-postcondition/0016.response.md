Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1 and the value of `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
