The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`. 
State: **`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i + 1`, and if `x // (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // (i + 1)` is also added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i + 1`, then `i + 1` is added to the list `l` and `i + 1` is updated to 1 if `i + 1` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, if `x // (i + 1)` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i + 1` is also added to the list `l`.**
