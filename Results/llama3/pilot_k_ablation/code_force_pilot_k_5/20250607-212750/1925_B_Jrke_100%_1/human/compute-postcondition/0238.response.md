Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `i` is an integer equal to the square root of `x` plus 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` and `n` remain unchanged as integers greater than 1, and `k` remains unchanged as an integer. The variable `ans` is updated to be the maximum value among all the divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to the square root of `x` plus 1. The variable `i` is updated to be the square root of `x` plus 1, which is the final value of the loop counter.
