Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 3, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, and `ans` is returned.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `l` is updated to contain only the value of `ans`, which is returned. The conditions related to `x` being a multiple of `i` and `x` divided by `i` being less than or equal to `k` are no longer relevant, as the code only updates the list `l` to contain the value of `ans`.
