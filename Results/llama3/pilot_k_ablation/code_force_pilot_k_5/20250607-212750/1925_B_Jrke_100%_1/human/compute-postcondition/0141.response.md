Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l` which depends on the values of `x // i`, `i`, and `k`.***
