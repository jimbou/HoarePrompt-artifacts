Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l` which depends on the values of `x // i`, `i`, and `k`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is determined by the maximum value of the list `l`, which is constructed based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The other variables, `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i`, retain their original values and properties.
