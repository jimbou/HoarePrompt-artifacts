Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 3, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `l` is now a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`, which is `ans`.
