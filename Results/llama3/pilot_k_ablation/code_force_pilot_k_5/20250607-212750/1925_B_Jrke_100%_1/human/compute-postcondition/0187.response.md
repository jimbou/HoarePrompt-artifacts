Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the maximum value in the list `l`.***
