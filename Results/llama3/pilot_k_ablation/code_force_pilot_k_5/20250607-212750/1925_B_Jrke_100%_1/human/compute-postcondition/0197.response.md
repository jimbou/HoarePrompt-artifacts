Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and the list `l` contains only one element which is `ans` which is 1 and is being printed. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to contain only one element which is `ans` which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains only one element which is `ans` which is 1 and is being printed. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`.
