To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than or equal to 1, because `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` will be at least 2, and the range will have at least one value.

Since `i` is already initialized to `int(x / n)`, we need to ensure that this value is within the range of the loop. However, we cannot adjust `i` directly, as it is not in the loop head. Instead, we can adjust `x` to ensure that `int(x / n)` is within the range.

Therefore, we need to adjust `x` to be greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of 1, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n)`, `stdin` contains no input**
