The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 2, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is greater than 3, and for the loop to execute again `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 must be greater than `i`, so `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 3, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i` and `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list which contains the values 1, 1 and `x // i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i` but `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, then the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged. If `x` is not a multiple of `i`, then the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged. `ans` is returned.**
