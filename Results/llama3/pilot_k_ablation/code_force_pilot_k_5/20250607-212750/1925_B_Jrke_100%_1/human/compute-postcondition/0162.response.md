Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 1, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `x // i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated by appending `x // i` to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the list `l` and the result of the integer division of `x` by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `i`.
