Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 16, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 5, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and 5, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1**

The code appends the value of `i` (which is 5) to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the original value of `ans` and the additional value 5. The stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
