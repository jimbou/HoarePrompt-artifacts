The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 must be greater than `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which contains the values 1, 1 and `x // i` if `x` divided by `i` is not greater than `k`, otherwise `l` contains the values 1, 1. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged. `i` is an integer greater than 2, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`.**
