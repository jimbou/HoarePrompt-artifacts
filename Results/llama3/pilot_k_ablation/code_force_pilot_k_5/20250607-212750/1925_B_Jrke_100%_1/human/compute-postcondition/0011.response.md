Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i`, and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is also added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and `i` is updated to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made. Additionally, if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`, which contains the values of `ans` (which is 1), `i`, and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is also added to the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.
