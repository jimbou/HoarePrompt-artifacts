The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is either 1 or `x` divided by `i`, `l` is a list containing either two values: 1 and 1 or three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`, `i` is 2, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` contains three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 1.**
