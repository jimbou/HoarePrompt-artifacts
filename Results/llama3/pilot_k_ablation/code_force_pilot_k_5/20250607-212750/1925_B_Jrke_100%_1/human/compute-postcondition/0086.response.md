Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 16, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 5, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is not specified because it is not defined in the initial state. The list `l` contains the value of `ans`, but the actual value of `ans` is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged.
