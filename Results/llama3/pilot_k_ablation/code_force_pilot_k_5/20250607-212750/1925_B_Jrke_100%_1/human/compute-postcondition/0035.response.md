Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, and `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `i` has been increased by 1 and is still less than `int(x)`. The list `l` has been updated to contain the maximum value in the list `l`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise it contains the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`.
