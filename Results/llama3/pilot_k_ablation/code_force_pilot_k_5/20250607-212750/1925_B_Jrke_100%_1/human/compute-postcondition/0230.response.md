The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `x` must remain the same.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is an integer greater than 2, `ans` is an integer. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing three integers: `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two integers: `ans` and `x // i**
