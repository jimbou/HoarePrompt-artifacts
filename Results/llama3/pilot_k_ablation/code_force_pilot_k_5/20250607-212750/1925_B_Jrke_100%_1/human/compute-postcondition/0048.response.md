The only variable in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than t, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 0, t is an integer. For the loop to execute again _ must be 1 and t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is the maximum value in the list l, l is a list containing the values of ans which is 1, i, and if x // i is less than or equal to k, then x // i is also added to the list l, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers x and n, _ is 1**
