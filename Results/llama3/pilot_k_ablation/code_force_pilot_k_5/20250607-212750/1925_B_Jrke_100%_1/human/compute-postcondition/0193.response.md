The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and the value returned by `int(input())`. If the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value returned by `int(input())` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute again the value returned by `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is the maximum value in the list l, i is an integer equal to int(x), and the maximum value in the list l which is ans is being printed, and the value returned by int(input()) is greater than 1**
