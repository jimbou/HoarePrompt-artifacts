Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` is 2 and `l` is a list containing three elements: the value of `ans`, 2, and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `l` is a list containing two elements: the value of `ans` and `x // 2`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and `x` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 2. The list `l` has been updated by appending the result of `x // i`, which is equivalent to `x // 2` since `i` is 2. The length of the list `l` has increased by 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` now contains three elements: the value of `ans`, 2, and `x // 2`. Otherwise, the list `l` now contains two elements: the value of `ans` and `x // 2`.
