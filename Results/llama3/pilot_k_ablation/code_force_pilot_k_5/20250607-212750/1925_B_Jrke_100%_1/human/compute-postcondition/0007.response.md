Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1 and `i`, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and `i` is updated to 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
