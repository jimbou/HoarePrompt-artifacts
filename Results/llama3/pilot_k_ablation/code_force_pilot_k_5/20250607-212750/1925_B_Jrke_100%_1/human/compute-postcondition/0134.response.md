The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 3, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is greater than 4 and for the loop to execute again `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 must be greater than `i` so `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4**
