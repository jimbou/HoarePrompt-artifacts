Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, l is a list containing the values of ans which is 1, i, and if x // i is less than or equal to k, then x // i is also added to the list l, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and n, _ is 1
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is either 1 or `x` divided by `i`, `l` is a list containing either two values: 1 and 1 or three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`, `i` is 1, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` contains three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 2, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list containing `x` divided by `i`, 3 and `x` divided by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i` but `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 1 and `l` contains three values: 1, 3 and `x` divided by `i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 4, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by 4, `ans` is the maximum value in the list containing the value of `ans` and 4 if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value in the list containing the value of `ans` and `x // 4` if `x // i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value in the list containing the value of `ans`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 16, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 5, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by 5, then `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 5` and 5 if 5 is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 5` and the value of `ans`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
