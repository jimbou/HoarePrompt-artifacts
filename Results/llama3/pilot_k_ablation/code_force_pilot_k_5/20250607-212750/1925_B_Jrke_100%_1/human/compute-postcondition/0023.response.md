Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the addition of `i` to the list `l`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the list `l` and the new element `i`. The stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
