To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):`. The objects involved are `i`, `x`, and the `range` object.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3.

The `range` object depends on the value of `x`. Since `x` is an integer greater than 0, `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` will be an integer greater than or equal to 3 (since `x ** 0.5` is at least 1, and adding 2 makes it at least 3). Therefore, the `range` object will still be valid for the next iteration.

The state of `x` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, `l`, and `_`) are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 3, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 1.**
