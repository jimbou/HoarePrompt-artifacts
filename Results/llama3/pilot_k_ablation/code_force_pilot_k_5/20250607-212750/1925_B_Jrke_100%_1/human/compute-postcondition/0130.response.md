Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 3, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i`, and `ans` is returned. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans`, and `ans` is returned. Additionally, `l` now also contains the integer value of `x` divided by `i`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged. The condition that `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i` still holds. The list `l` has been updated to include the integer value of `x` divided by `i`. The return value of `ans` is still present, and its value is unchanged.
