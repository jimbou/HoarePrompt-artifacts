Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t`, `n`, and `k` remain unchanged, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, and `i` is the upper limit of the loop, which is the square root of `x` plus 2.
