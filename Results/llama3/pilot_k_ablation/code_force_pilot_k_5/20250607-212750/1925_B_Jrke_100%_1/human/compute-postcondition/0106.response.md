Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and a multiple of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is updated to contain the values 1, 1 and `x // i`.***
