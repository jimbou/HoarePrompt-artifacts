The only variable in the loop head is the variable `_`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x**0.5)`, `int(input())` is greater than 1**
