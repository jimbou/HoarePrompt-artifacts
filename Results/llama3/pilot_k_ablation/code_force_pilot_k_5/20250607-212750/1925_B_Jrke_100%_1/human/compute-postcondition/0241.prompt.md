Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), then t pairs of integers x and n (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    k = x // n
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
        if x % i == 0:
            l = [ans]
            if i <= k:
                l.append(i)
            if x // i <= k:
                l.append(x // i)
            ans = max(l)
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is the maximum value in the list l, l is a list containing the values of ans which is 1, i, and if x // i is less than or equal to k, then x // i is also added to the list l, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers x and n, _ is 0. If x is divisible by i, then i is added to the list l and i is updated to 1 if i is less than or equal to k. Additionally, if x // i is less than or equal to k, then the integer division of x by i is also added to the list l, and the maximum value in the list l which is ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list containing 1 and all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` is `int(x

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer greater than or equal to 1, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is the maximum value in the list l, i is an integer equal to int(x), and the maximum value in the list l which is ans is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `ans` is an integer, `i` is an integer equal to the square root of `x` plus 1, and the value of `ans` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
