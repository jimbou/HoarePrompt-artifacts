Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 2, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 1.***
