Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `ans` is an integer. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing two integers: `ans` and `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing one integer: `ans`.***
