To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 2`.

To adjust the state for the next iteration, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes `int(x / n) + 3`.

The state of `x` remains unchanged, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `l` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 3**
