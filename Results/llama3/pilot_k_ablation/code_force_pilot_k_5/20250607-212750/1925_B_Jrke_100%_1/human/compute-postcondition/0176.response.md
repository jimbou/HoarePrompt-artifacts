Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 3, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The value of `i` is `int(x / n) + 3`, which is an integer. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
