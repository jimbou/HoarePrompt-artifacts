The code `l.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is 4, the list `l` now contains the value of `ans` and 4.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and 4, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1.**
