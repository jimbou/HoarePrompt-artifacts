Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 4`, `l` is a list containing only the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the list `l` has been updated to only contain the maximum value in the list `l`, which is stored in the variable `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged.
