The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `x` must be greater than or equal to the square of `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // i`. Also, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1 and `x // i`.**
