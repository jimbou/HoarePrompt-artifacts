Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing only the value of `ans` which is 1, `i` is 1, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`**

In this output state, the list `l` has been reset to contain only the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions that were true before the code was executed are still true. The stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, and the current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`.
