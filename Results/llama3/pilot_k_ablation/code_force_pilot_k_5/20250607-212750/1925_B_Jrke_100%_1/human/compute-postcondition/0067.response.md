Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is `x` divided by `i`, `l` is a list containing two or three values, `i` is 2, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1.**

The value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. Since `l` contains either three values: `x` divided by `i`, 2 and `x` divided by `i` or 1, 2 and `x` divided by `i`, the maximum value is `x` divided by `i` because `x` divided by `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and 2 is greater than 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
