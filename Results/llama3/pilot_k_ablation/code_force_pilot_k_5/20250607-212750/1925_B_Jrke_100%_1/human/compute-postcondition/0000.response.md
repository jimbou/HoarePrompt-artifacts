The only objects in the loop head are variables  _ and input. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input. If the input is at least 1 the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), then t pairs of integers x and n (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x). So for the loop to be executed  the input must be at least 1 and _ is 0.
State: **stdin contains t+1 inputs: first an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3), then t pairs of integers x and n (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and 1 ≤ n ≤ x), _ is 0, input is at least 1**
