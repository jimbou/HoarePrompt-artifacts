Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 3, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. `ans` is returned and is equal to the maximum value in the list `l`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` contains the value of `ans` and `i`. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains the integer value of `x` divided by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables retain their original values and conditions. The list `l` contains the value of `ans` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and also contains the integer value of `x` divided by `i` if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.
