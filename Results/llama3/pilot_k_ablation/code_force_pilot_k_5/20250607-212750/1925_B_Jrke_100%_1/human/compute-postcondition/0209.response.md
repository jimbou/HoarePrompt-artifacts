Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` is 2 and `l` is a list containing two elements: the value of `ans` and 2. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `l` is a list containing one element which is the value of `ans`.***
