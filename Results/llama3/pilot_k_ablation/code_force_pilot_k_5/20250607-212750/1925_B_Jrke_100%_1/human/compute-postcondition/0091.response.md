Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 16, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 5, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and 5 if 5 is less than or equal to `k` and `x // 5` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // 5`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` contains either the value of `ans` and 5, or the value of `ans` and `x // 5`, depending on the values of `k` and `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.
