Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `l` is a list containing either three integers: `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or two integers: `ans` and `x // i` if `i` is greater than `k`.***
