Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`.**

The code initializes the list `l` with the maximum value in the list `l`, which is `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and `_` is the same as in the initial state. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the list `l`, which is `ans`. The stdin still contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
