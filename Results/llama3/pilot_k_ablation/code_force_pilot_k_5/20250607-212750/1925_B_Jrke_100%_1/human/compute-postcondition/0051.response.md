Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` is 1, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k` and also added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`***
