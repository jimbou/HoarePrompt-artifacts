To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is greater than 0 and `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` plus 2.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i` is 1, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k` and also added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1**
