Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 16, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 5, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by 5, then `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 5` and 5 if 5 is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value between `x // 5` and the value of `ans`.***
