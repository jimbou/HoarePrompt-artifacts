Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, l is a list containing the values of ans which is 1, i, and if x // i is less than or equal to k, then x // i is also added to the list l, stdin contains t-1 inputs: t-1 pairs of integers x and n, _ is 1**

In this output state, the values of t, x, n, ans, l, and _ remain unchanged from the initial state. The value of k is updated to be the integer division of x by n. The stdin now contains t-1 pairs of integers x and n, as one pair has been consumed by the input operation.
