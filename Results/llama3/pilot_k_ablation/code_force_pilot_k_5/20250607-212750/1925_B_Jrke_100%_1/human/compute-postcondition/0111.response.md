Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list containing the values `ans` and `i`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The initial state of `l` is a list containing the value `ans`, so after the code is executed, `l` will contain both `ans` and `i`. The values of the other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, and `k`) are not affected by the code.
