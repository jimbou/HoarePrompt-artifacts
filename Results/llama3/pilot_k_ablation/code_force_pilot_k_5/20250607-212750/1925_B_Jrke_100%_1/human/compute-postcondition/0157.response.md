Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n)`, and `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values of 1, `int(x / n)`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values of 1 and `int(x / n)`.***
