Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1 and the value of `i`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0.**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains the value of `i` in addition to the value of `ans` which is 1. The value of `i` is not specified, so it can be any integer. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n` because one pair has been read and processed.
