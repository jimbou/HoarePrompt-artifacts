Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i`, and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is also added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and `i` is updated to 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`.***
