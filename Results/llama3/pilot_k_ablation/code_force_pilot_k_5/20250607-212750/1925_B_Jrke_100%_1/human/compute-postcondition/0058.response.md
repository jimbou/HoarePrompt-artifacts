Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing three values: 1, 1 and `x` divided by `i`, `i` is 1, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, the current value of `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.***
