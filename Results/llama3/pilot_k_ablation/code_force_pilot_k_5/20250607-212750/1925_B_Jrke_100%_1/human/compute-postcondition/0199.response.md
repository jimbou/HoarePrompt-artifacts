Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and the list `l` contains two elements which are `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1 and is being printed. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`. The current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `i` is 1, the list `l` now contains two elements: `ans` which is 1 and `i` which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The current value of `x` is still divisible by `i`, and the current value of `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.
