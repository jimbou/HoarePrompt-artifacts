Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of 1, i is an integer equal to int(x / n), stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The values of `x` and `n` are updated based on the input from stdin, which is now empty. The value of `k` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by `n`. The value of `ans` is reset to 1. The list `l` contains the value of `ans`, which is 1. The value of `i` is calculated as the integer division of `x` by `n`.
