Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, and `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been increased by 1, and it is still less than `int(x)`. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the list `l`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x // i`. The other variables, `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `ans`, remain unchanged.
