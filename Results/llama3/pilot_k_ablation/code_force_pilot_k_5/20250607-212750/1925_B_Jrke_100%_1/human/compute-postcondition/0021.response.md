State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
