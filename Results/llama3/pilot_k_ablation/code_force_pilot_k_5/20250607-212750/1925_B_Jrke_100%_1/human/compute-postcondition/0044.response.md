Postcondition: ***`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.***
