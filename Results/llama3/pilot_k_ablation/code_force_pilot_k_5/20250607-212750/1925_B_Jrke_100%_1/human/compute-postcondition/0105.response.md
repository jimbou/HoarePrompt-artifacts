Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and a multiple of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1 and `x // i`, `i` is 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `k`. The current value of `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**

The value of `x` divided by `i` is appended to the list `l`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `l` now contains three values: 1, 1, and `x // i`.
