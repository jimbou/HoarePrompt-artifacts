To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `x`, and the range defined by `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.

Since `i` is in the range defined by `1` and `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, we need to ensure that this range has at least one value. This means `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must be greater than `1`.

Given that `x` is an integer greater than `1`, we can infer that `x` must be at least `2` to satisfy the condition `int(x ** 0.5) + 2 > 1`.

The state of `i` should be adjusted to be within the range, so `i` is now `1`.

The states of `t`, `n`, `k`, `ans`, and the list `l` are not directly related to the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and the maximum value in the list `l` which is `ans` is being printed**
