Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 3, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` is a list containing two values: `x` divided by `i` and 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 3.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the value of `i`, which is 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains two values: either `x` divided by `i` and 3, or 1 and 3, depending on whether `x` is divisible by `i`.
