Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4, `l` is a list containing one element which is `ans`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The code only introduces a new variable `l`, which is a list containing one element, `ans`. The relationship between `x` and `i` is still valid, and the condition that `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4 is still satisfied.
