Output State: **t is an integer, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers x and n, _ is 0**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `x` and `n`. Since stdin contains `t+1` inputs, after reading the first pair of integers, stdin will be left with `t` pairs of integers. The second line calculates the integer division of `x` by `n` and assigns the result to `k`. The third line assigns the value 1 to `ans`. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0.
