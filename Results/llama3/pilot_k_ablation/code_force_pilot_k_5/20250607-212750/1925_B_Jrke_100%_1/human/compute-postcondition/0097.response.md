Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of 1, i is not defined**

The code snippet first assigns the integer values of the input to `x` and `n`, respectively. The value of `x` is now an integer, and the value of `n` is also an integer. The second line calculates the integer division of `x` by `n` and assigns the result to `k`, making `k` an integer. The third line assigns the value 1 to `ans`. The variables `t`, `l`, and `i` are not affected by the code snippet.
