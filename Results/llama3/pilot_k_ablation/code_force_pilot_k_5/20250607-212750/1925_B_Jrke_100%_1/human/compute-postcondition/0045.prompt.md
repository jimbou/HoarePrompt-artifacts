Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, stdin contains t inputs: t pairs of integers x and n, _ is 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the values of `ans` which is 1, `i`, and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is also added to the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and `i` is updated to 1 if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Additionally, if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l` and if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
