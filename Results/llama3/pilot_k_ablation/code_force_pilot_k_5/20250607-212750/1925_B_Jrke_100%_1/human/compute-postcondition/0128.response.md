Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 3, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i`, and `ans` is returned.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`, which initially contains only the value of `ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains two elements: the original value of `ans` and the value of `i`. The value of `ans` is still returned.
