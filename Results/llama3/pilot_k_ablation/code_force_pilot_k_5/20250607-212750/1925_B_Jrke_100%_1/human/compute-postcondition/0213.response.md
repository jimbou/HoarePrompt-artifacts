Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by 2, `l` is a list containing either three elements: the value of `ans`, 2, and `x // 2` or two elements: the value of `ans` and `x // 2`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
