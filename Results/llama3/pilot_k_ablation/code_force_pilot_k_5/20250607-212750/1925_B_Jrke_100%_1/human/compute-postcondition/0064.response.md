Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is either 1 or `x` divided by `i`, `l` is a list containing one or two values: either 1 or `x` divided by `i` and optionally 2, `i` is 2, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` contains two values: `x` divided by `i` and 2. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 2. If `i` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is either 1 or `x` divided by `i` and `l` contains one value: either 1 or `x` divided by `i`.***
