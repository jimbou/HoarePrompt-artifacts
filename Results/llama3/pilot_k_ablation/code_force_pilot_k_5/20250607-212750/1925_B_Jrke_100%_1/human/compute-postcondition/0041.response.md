Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `x // i` is appended to the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is still greater than 0, `ans` is still the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is still increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is still a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and a new value `x // i` is added to the list `l`.
