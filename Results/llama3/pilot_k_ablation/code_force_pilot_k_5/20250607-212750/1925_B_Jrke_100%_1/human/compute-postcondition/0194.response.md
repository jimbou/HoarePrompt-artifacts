The code snippet provided consists of three lines. The first line assigns the values of `x` and `n` from the input to the variables `x` and `n`, respectively. The second line calculates the integer division of `x` by `n` and assigns the result to `k`. The third line assigns the value 1 to `ans`.

Output State: **t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, ans is 1, i is an integer equal to the original value of x, and the maximum value in the list l which is ans is being printed.**
