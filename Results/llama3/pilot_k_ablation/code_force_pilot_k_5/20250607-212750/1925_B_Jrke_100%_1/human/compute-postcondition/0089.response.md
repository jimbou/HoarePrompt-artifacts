Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 16, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 5, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and 5 if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // 5`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated by appending the result of `x // i`, where `i` is 5. Since `x` is an integer greater than 16, `x // 5` will be an integer greater than 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
