Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 4`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `x // i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is returned at the output state.***
