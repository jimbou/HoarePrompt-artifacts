Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and 4 if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // 4` if `x // i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `ans` is the maximum value in `l`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains the value of `ans` and possibly additional values based on the conditions specified in the initial state. The stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
