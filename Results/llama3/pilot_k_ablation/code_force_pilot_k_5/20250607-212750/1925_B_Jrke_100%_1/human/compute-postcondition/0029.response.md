The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is some integer, `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.
State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`.**
