Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is appended to the list `l`. `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`. This means that `ans` will be the largest value among the maximum value in the list `l` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`.
