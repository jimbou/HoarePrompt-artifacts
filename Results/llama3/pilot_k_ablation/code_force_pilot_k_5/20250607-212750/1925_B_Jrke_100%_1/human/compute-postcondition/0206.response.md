The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than 4**
