Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list containing 1 and all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `i` is `int(x**0.5)`, and the maximum value in the list containing 1 and all divisors of `x` that are less than or equal to `k` which is `ans` is being printed**
