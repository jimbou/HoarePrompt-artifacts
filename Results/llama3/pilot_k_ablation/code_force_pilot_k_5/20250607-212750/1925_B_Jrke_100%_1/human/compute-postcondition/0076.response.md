Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i` and `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list containing `x` divided by `i`, 3 and `x` divided by `i`. If `x` is divisible by `i` but `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, then `ans` is 1 and `l` contains three values: 1, 3 and `x` divided by `i`. If `x` is not divisible by `i`, then `ans` is 1 and `l` contains two values: 1 and 1.***
