Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`**

In natural language, the output state is: All the variables `t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers. The value of `x` is greater than 0. The value of `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. The value of `i` is increased by 1 and it is less than the integer value of `x`. The list `l` contains the maximum value in the list `l`.
