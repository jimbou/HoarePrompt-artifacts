Output State: **`t` is an integer, `x` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` which is 1, `stdin` contains `t` inputs: `t` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is divisible by `i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The code creates a new list `l` containing the value of `ans`, which is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains the value 1, which is the current value of `ans`. All other variables retain their initial values and properties.
