Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is an integer greater than 2, `ans` is an integer. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value among `ans` and `x // i`.***
