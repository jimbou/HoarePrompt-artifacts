Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `ans` is an integer. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three integers: `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two integers: `ans` and `x // i`.***
