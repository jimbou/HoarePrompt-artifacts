Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 3, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` is a list containing three values: `x` divided by `i`, 3 and `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains three values: 1, 3 and `x` divided by `i`.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include an additional element, which is `x` divided by `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k` is still valid, and the values of `ans` and `l` depend on whether `i` is less than or equal to `k` and whether `x` is divisible by `i`.
