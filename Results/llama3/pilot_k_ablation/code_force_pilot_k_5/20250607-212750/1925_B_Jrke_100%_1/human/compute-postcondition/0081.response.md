Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and 4 if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // 4`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `l` has been updated to include the result of the expression `x // i`, which is equivalent to `x // 4` since `i` is 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
