Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three elements which are `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two elements which are `ans` and `x // i`. If `x // i` is greater than `k`, then if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing two elements which are `ans` and `i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing one element which is `ans`.***
