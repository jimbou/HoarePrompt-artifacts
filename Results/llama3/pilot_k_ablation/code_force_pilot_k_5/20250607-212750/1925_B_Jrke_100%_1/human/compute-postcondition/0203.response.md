Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains three elements: `ans` which is 1, `i` which is 1, and `x // i` which is `x` because `i` is 1, and is being printed if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains two elements: `ans` which is 1 and `x // i` which is `x` because `i` is 1, and is being printed.***
