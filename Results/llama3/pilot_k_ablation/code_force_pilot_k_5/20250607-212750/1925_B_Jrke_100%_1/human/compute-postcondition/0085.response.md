The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `int(x ** 0.5) + 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `x` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `int(x ** 0.5) + 2` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 16, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 5, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1**
