Postcondition: ***`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, and `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x // i`. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, and `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`.***
