Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i`**.

The list `l` now contains an additional element, which is the current value of `i`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still less than `int(x)`, and `ans` is still the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` now contains all its previous elements plus the current value of `i`.
