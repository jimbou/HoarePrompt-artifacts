Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing only the maximum value in the list `l` and `x // i`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t`, `x`, `n`, and `k` remains unchanged. The value of `ans` is still the maximum value in the list `l`. The list `l` now contains an additional element, which is the integer division of `x` by `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` contains both the maximum value and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` contains only the maximum value and `x // i`.
