Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is not specified, so it is assumed to be some unknown value. The list `l` is created with this unknown value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`.
