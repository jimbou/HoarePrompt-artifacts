Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and a multiple of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // i`, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1 and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, the list `l` remains unchanged, so `ans` is still 1. However, if `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` is updated to contain the values 1, 1, and `x // i`, so `ans` is updated to be the maximum value in this list, which is `x // i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
