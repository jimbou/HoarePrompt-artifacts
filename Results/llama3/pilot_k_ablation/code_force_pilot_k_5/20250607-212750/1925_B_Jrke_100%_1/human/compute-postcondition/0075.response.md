Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then if `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and `l` is a list containing three values: `x` divided by `i`, 3 and `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and `l` contains three values: 1, 3 and `x` divided by `i`. `ans` is now the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be the maximum value in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged. The maximum value in `l` is either `x` divided by `i` (if `x` is divisible by `i`) or 3 (if `x` is not divisible by `i`).
