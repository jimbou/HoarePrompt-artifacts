Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three elements which are `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two elements which are `ans` and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the value of `x // i` is added to the list `l`. The value of `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by `i`, which is an integer greater than 4. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains either three elements (`ans`, `i`, and `x // i`) if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or two elements (`ans` and `x // i`) otherwise.
