Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4, `l` is a list containing two elements which are `ans` and `i`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The initial state of `l` is a list containing one element which is `ans`. After the execution of the code, `l` now contains two elements: `ans` and `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
