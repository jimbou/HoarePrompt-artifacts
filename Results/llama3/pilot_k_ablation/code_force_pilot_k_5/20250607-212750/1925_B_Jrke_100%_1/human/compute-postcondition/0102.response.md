The code `l.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the list `l`. The initial state is: `t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of 1, `i` is 1. The current value of `x` is a multiple of `i`. Additionally, the current value of `i` is less than or equal to `k`. After executing the code, the list `l` now contains two values: 1 and 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The current value of `x` is still a multiple of `i`, and the current value of `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and a multiple of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1, `i` is 1 and `i` is less than or equal to `k`.**
