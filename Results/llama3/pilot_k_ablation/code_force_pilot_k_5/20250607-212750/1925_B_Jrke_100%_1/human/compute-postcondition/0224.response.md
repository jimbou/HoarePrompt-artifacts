Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is an integer greater than 1, `ans` is an integer, `l` is a list containing two integers: `ans` and `i`.**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. Since `l` initially contained one integer `ans`, it now contains two integers: `ans` and `i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
