Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is either 1 or `x` divided by `i`, `l` is a list containing two values: either 1 or `x` divided by `i` and 2, `i` is 2, `x` // `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is `x` divided by `i` and the first value of `l` is `x` divided by `i`. Otherwise, `ans` is 1 and the first value of `l` is 1.**

In this output state, the list `l` now contains two values: either 1 or `x` divided by `i` (depending on whether `x` is divisible by `i`) and 2 (which is the value of `i`). The other variables remain unchanged.
