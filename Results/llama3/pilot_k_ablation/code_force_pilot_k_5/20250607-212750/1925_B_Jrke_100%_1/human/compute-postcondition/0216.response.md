Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `ans` is an integer, `l` is a list containing two integers: `ans` and `i`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The list `l` now contains two integers: the original value of `ans` and the new value `i`, which is appended to the list.
