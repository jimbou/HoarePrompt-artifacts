Postcondition: ***`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`, the value of `i`, and the value of `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`.***
