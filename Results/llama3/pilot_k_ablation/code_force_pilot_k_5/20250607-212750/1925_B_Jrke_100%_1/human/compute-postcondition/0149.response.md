Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is 1, `l` is a list containing the value of 1, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n)`, `stdin` contains no input.**

The code only changes the value of `l`, which is now a list containing the value of `ans`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still a multiple of `i`.
