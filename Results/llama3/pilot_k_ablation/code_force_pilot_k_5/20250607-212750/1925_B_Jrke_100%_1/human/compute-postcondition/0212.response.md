Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2, `l` is a list containing either three elements: the value of `ans`, 2, and `x // 2` or two elements: the value of `ans` and `x // 2`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `i` remain unchanged. The list `l` still contains either three elements or two elements depending on the condition `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`. The variable `ans` is assigned the maximum value in the list `l`.
