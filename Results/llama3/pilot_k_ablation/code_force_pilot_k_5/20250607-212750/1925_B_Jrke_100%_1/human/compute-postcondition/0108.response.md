Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // i`. Also, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1 and `x // i`.***
