Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of 1, i is an integer equal to int(x / n), stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n)`, and `stdin` contains no input. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing the values of 1, `int(x / n)`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing the values of 1 and `int(x / n)`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` contains the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `x // i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 2. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `x // i` is added to the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 3. `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 4`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` also contains `x // i`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is returned at the output state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
