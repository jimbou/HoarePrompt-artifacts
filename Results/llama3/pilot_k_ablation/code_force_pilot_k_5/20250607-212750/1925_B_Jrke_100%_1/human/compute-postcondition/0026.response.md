Postcondition: ***`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `i` is added to the list `l`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then the integer division of `x` by `i` is also added to the list `l`.***
