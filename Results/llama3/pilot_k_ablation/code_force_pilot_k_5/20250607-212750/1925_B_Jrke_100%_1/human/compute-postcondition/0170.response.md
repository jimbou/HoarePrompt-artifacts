Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is an integer equal to `int(x / n) + 2, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and `x // i`**.

The value of `x // i` is added to the list `l`, where `x // i` is the integer division of `x` by `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the list `l` and the new value `x // i`.
