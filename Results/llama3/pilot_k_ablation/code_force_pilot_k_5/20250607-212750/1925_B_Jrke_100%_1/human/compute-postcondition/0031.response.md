Output State: **`t`, `x`, `n`, `k` are integers, `x` is greater than 0, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`, `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, `l` is a list containing the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`**

The code appends the value of `i` to the list `l`. The value of `i` is increased by 1 and it must be less than `int(x)`, so the new value of `i` is still less than `int(x)`. The list `l` now contains the maximum value in the list `l` and the value of `i`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
