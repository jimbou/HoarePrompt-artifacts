Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `ans` is an integer. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `l` is a list containing three integers: `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two integers: `ans` and `x // i`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The list `l` is updated by appending the value of `x // i`, where `x` is an integer greater than 4 and `i` is an integer. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the list `l` now contains three integers: `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, the list `l` now contains two integers: `ans` and `x // i`.
