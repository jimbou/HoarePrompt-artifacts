Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is an integer greater than 2, `ans` is an integer. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. `l` is a list containing one integer: `ans`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `x`, `i`, and `ans` remain unchanged. The only change is that `l` is now a list containing a single integer, which is the current value of `ans`. The conditions related to `x` being divisible by `i` and the value of `x // i` compared to `k` are still applicable, but they do not affect the value of `l` in this case, as `l` is initialized with only one element, `ans`.
