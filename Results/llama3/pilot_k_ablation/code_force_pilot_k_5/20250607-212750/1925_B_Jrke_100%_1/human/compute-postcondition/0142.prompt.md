Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer, n is an integer, k is an integer, ans is 1, l is a list containing the value of 1, i is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `ans` is `x // i`. Also, `l` is a list containing the values 1 and 1 if `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the values 1, 1 and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l` which contains the values 1, 1 and `x // i` if `x` divided by `i` is not greater than `k`, otherwise `l` contains the values 1, 1. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 2, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i` and `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i` and `x // i`, and `ans` is the maximum value in the list which contains the values 1, 1 and `x // i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i` but `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, then the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged. If `x` is not a multiple of `i`, then the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged. `ans` is returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 3, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i` and `x` divided by `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `ans` is returned and is equal to the maximum value in the list `l` containing the value of `ans` and `i` and `x // i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i` but `x` divided by `i` is greater than `k`, or if `x` is not a multiple of `i`, then the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged and `ans` is returned.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 4, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l` which depends on the values of `x // i`, `i`, and `k`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
