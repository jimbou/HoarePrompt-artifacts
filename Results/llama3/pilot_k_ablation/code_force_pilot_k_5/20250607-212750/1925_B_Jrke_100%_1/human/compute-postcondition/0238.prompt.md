Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 1, x is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, ans is 1, i is an integer equal to the original value of x, and the maximum value in the list l which is ans is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 2):
    if x % i == 0:
        l = [ans]
        if i <= k:
            l.append(i)
        if x // i <= k:
            l.append(x // i)
        ans = max(l)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `i` is 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is set to `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 2. If `x` is divisible by 2, `l` is a list containing either three elements: the value of `ans`, 2, and `x // 2` or two elements: the value of `ans` and `x // 2`, `ans` is the maximum value in the list `l`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4. If `x` is divisible by `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value of the list `l`, `l` is a list containing either three integers: `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `i` is less than or equal to `k`, or two integers: `ans` and `x // i` if `i` is greater than `k`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is an integer greater than 1, `ans` is an integer. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing three integers: `ans`, `i`, and `x // i`. Otherwise, `l` is a list containing two integers: `ans` and `x // i`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is an integer greater than 2, `ans` is an integer. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is the maximum value among `ans`, `i`, and `x // i` if `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `ans` is the maximum value among `ans` and `x // i`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
