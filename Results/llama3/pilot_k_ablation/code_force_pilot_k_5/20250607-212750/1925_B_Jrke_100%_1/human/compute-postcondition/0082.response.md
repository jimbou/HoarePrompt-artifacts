Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is 4, `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and 4 if `i` is less than or equal to `k` and `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `x // 4` if `x // i` is greater than `k`, otherwise `l` is a list containing the value of `ans`, `stdin` contains `t-1` inputs: `t-1` pairs of integers `x` and `n`, `_` is 1.***
