Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4. If `x // i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `i` is 2 and `l` is a list containing three elements: the value of `ans`, 2, and `x // 2`. Otherwise, `i` is 2 and `l` is a list containing two elements: the value of `ans` and `x // 2`.***
