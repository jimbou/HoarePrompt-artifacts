Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to the square of `i`, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `i` is an integer greater than 2, `x` to the power of 0.5 plus 2 is greater than `i`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, then `l` is a list containing the value of `ans` and `i`. If `x` is a multiple of `i`, then `ans` is the maximum value in the list which contains the values 1, 1 and `x // i` if `x` divided by `i` is not greater than `k`, otherwise `l` contains the values 1, 1 and `i`. Otherwise, the state of `t`, `x`, `n`, `k`, `ans` and `l` remains unchanged.***
