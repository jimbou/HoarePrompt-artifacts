Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the last element of b, j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j] plus the last element of b if j is not equal to k, or f[j - 1] plus the last element of b if j is equal to k, and res is an integer equal to the minimum of infinity and the maximum of end minus s, s minus start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. Additionally, res is not equal to infinity, and the value of res is being printed.**
