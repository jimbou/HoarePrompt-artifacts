Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is 2, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the second element of b, and j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order.**

In this output state, the value of `remain` has been updated to be the difference between `mid` and the second element of `b` (since `i` is 2). The value of `j` has been updated to be the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, as determined by the `bisect.bisect_left` function. All other variables remain unchanged.
