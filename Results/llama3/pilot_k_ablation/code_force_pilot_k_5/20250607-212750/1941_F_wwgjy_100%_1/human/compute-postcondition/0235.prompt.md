Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, _ is 2, i is m, remain is not defined, j is not defined, s is not defined, and res is infinity.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 0, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, then `s` is `f[k - 1] + b[0]`, and `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. Otherwise, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `res` is either infinity or the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, depending on whether `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is greater than 0, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, _ is 2, i is 1, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is f[j - 1] + b[i] if j is equal to k, otherwise s is f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise f[j - 1] + b[i], res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is equal to `k`, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, and `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then `s` is `f[j] + b[i]`. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is greater than 0, m is greater than 4, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, _ is 2, i is 4, remain is mid - b[i], j is the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j equals k, then s is f[j - 1] + b[i] and res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. If j does not equal k, then s is f[j] + b[i] and res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. If start is not less than s or s is not less than end, then the values of res, start, end, s remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
