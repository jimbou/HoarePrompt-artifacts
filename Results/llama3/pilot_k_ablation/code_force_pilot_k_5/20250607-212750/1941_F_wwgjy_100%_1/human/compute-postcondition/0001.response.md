Output State: **n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, res is infinity, and _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 3 integers and 3 lists of integers.**

In this output state, the values of n, m, and k are integers read from the first line of stdin. The list a contains integers read from the second line of stdin, and the lists b and f contain integers read from the third and fourth lines of stdin, respectively. The list gap contains tuples representing the differences between consecutive elements in a, sorted in descending order. The variables start, end, and mid represent the first element, second element, and midpoint of the largest gap in a, respectively. The variable nd represents the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0. The variable res is initialized to infinity. The variable _ remains unchanged at 0. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus the 4 inputs that were read.
