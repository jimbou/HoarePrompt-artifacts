Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `res` are integers or lists of integers. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, `res` is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains infinity.***
