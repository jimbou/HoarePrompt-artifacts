Output: **res (where res is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all s that are within the range (start, end) and are equal to f[j - 1] + b[i] if j equals k, otherwise f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise f[j - 1] + b[i], where j is the insertion point of mid - b[i] in f to maintain sorted order)**
