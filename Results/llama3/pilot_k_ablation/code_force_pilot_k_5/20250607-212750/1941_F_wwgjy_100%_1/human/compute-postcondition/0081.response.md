State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `_` is 1, `i` is `m`, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the first element of the smallest gap in `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `res` is being printed.**
