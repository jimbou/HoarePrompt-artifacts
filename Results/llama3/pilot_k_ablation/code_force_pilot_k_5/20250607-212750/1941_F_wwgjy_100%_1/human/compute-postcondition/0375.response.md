Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i+1`, `remain`, `j`, `s` are integers or lists of integers as described in the precondition. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is an integer equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Additionally, `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, and `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
