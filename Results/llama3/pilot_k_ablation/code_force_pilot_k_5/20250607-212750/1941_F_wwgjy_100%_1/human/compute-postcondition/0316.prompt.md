Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, res is infinity
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is 0, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[0], and j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, then res is the minimum of the previous value of res and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start < s < end, otherwise res remains infinity, and s is an integer equal to f[k - 1] + b[0]. If j is not equal to k, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s which is less than end, otherwise res is infinity, and s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[0] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[0].

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is 1, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[1], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[1] if j is equal to k, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i]. If start is less than s which is less than end, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, res remains infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `i` is 2, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` is equal to `k`, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. `res` is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is 3, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[i], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i] if j is equal to k, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i], res is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s which is less than end, otherwise res remains infinity

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `res` are integers or lists of integers. If `j` equals `k`, then if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, `res` is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains infinity. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, otherwise `res` remains infinity.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
