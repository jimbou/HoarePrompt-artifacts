Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of infinity and the maximum of `end` minus `s`, `s` minus `start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. Otherwise, `res` is infinity. `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the first element of `b`, `j` is an integer equal to `k`, and `s` is an integer equal to `f[k - 1]` plus the first element of `b`.**
