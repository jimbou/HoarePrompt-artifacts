Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s` are integers or lists of integers, `m` is greater than 2, `b`, `f`, `gap` are sorted, `i` is 4, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, otherwise `res` remains infinity.***
