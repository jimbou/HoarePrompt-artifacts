Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s`, and `res` are integers or lists of integers. If `j` equals `k`, then if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, `res` is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains infinity. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, otherwise `res` remains infinity.**
