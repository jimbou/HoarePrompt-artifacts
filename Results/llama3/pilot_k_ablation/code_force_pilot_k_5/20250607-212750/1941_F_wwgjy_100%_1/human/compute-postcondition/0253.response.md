Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is infinity, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[0]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[0]`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition of a new variable `s` which is the sum of the `j`-th element of the sorted list `f` and the first element of the sorted list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged.
