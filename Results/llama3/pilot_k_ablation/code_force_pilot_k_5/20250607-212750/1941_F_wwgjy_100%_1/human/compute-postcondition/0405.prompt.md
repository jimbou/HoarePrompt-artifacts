Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, m, and k. The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots a_n. The third line contains m integers d_1, d_2, d_3, \dots d_m. The fourth line contains k integers f_1, f_2, f_3, \dots f_k. All integers are non-negative.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = [*map(int, input().split())]
    a = [*map(int, input().split())]
    b = [*map(int, input().split())]
    f = [*map(int, input().split())]
    gap = [(y - x, x, y) for y, x in zip(a[1:], a)]
    gap.sort(reverse=True)
    start = gap[0][1]
    end = gap[0][2]
    mid = (start + end) // 2
    nd = 0 if len(gap) == 1 else gap[1][0]
    b.sort()
    f.sort()
    res = inf
    for i in range(m):
        remain = mid - b[i]
        j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
        if j == k:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        else:
            s = f[j] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
            if j >= 1:
                s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
                if start < s < end:
                    res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    if res == inf:
        print(gap[0][0])
    else:
        print(res)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `_` is 0, `i` is `m`, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `res` is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list which is the first element of the smallest gap in `a` is being printed. Otherwise, the value of `res` is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, _ is 1, i is m, remain is not defined, j is not defined, s is not defined, and res is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all valid s. If res is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is the first difference between consecutive elements in a is printed. Otherwise, the value of res is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: The program prints the first element of the first tuple in the gap list if the current value of res is infinity, otherwise it prints the finite value of res, which is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all s that are within the range (start, end) and are equal to f[j - 1] + b[i] if j equals k, otherwise f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise f[j - 1] + b[i], where j is the insertion point of mid - b[i] in f to maintain sorted order.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[m - 1], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[m - 1] if j is equal to k, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[m - 1] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[m - 1], and either the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is gap[0][0] is being printed if res is infinity, or the value of res is being printed if res is not equal to infinity.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is an integer, m is an integer greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the last element of b, j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j] plus the last element of b if j is not equal to k, or f[j - 1] plus the last element of b if j is equal to k, and res is an integer equal to the minimum of infinity and the maximum of end minus s, s minus start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. If res is equal to infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the gap list is printed. Otherwise, the value of res is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
