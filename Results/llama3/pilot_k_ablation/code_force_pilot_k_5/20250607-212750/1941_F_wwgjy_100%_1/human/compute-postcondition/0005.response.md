Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `res` is infinity, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the ith element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 3 integers and 3 lists of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `res`, `_`, `i`, `remain`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that a new variable `s` is introduced, which is equal to the sum of the `(k - 1)`th element of `f` and the first element of `b`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 3 integers and 3 lists of integers.
