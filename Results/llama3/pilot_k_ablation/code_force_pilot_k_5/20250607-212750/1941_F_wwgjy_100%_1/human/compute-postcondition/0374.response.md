Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i+1`, `remain` is equal to `mid - b[i]`, `j` is equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `res` is equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i+1` remain unchanged. The value of `remain` is updated to be `mid - b[i]`. The value of `j` is updated to be the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. The value of `s` is updated to be `f[j - 1] + b[i]`. The value of `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.
