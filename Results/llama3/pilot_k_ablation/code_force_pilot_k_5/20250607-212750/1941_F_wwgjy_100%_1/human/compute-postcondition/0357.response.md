Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is 1, remain is an integer equal to mid minus the first element of b, and j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, then res is the minimum of infinity and the maximum of end minus s, s minus start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end. Otherwise, res is infinity, and s is an integer equal to f[k - 1] plus the first element of b. If j is not equal to k, then s is equal to f[j] plus the first element of b. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is the minimum of the previous value of res and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is updated to be f[j - 1] plus the first element of b.***
