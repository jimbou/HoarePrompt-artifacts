Postcondition: **n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, _ is 1, i is m, remain is not defined, j is not defined, s is not defined, and res is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all valid s. If res is infinity, the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is the first difference between consecutive elements in a is printed. Otherwise, the value of res is printed.**
