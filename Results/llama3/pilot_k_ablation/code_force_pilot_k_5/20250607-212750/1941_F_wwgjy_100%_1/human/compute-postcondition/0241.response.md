Output: **n is greater than 0, m is greater than or equal to 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, _ is 2, i is m, remain is not defined, j is not defined, s is not defined, and res is a finite value that is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all s that are within the range (start, end) and are equal to f[j - 1] + b[i] if j equals k, otherwise f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise f[j - 1] + b[i], where j is the insertion point of mid - b[i] in f to maintain sorted order, and res is printed**
