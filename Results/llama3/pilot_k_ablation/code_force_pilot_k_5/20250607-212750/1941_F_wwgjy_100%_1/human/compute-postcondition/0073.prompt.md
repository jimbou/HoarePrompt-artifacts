Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, and k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, res is infinity, and _ is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 3 integers and 3 lists of integers.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(m):
    remain = mid - b[i]
    j = bisect.bisect_left(f, remain)
    if j == k:
        s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
    else:
        s = f[j] + b[i]
        if start < s < end:
            res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))
        if j >= 1:
            s = f[j - 1] + b[i]
            if start < s < end:
                res = min(res, max(end - s, s - start, nd))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the ith element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is equal to `f[k - 1] + b[0]` if `j` equals `k`, otherwise `s` is the sum of the (j-1)th element of `f` and the ith element of `b`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `_` is 0, `i` is 1, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order. If `j` equals `k`, `s` is the sum of the `(j-1)`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b`. If `j` is not equal to `k`, `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 2, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `_` is 0, `i` is 2, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the `i`th element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `j` equals `k`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. If `j` is not equal to `k`, then if `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `_` is 0, `i` is 3, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the ith element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is the sum of the jth element of `f` and the ith element of `b` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j] + b[i]`. If `j` is equal to `k`, then `s` is the sum of the (j-1)th element of `f` and the ith element of `b`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, `res` remains unchanged.

If `j` is equal to `k`, then `s` is the sum of the `(j-1)`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b`. Otherwise, `s` is the sum of the `j`th element of `f` and the `i`th element of `b` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is equal to `f[j]` + `b[i]`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
