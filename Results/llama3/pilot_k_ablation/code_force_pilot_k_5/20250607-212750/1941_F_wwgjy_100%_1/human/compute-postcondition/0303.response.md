State: **n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 2, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is 4, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[i], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i] if j is equal to k, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[i], res is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s which is less than end, otherwise res remains infinity**
