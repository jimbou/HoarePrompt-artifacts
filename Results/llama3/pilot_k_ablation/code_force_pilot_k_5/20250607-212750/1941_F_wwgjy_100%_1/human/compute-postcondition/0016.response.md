Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, otherwise `res` remains infinity, `_` is 0, `i` is 0, `remain` is the difference between `mid` and the ith element of `b`, `j` is the insertion point for `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is the sum of the (j-1)th element of `f` and the ith element of `b`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 4 inputs: 3 integers and 3 lists of integers, and `j` is not equal to `k`. The current value of `j` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`.***
