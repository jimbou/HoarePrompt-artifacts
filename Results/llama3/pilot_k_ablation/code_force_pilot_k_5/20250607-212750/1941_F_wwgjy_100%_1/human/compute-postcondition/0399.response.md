The code prints the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list. Since `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, the first tuple is the one with the largest value. The first element of this tuple is printed.

Output: **the first element of the first tuple in the gap list (which is the largest value in the gap list)**
