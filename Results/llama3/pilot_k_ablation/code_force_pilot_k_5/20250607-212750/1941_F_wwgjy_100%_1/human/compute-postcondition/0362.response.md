Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `i` is 2, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid` minus the second element of `b`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is an integer equal to the sum of the element at index `j-1` of `f` and the second element of `b`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is an integer equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
