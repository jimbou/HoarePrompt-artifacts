The code prints the first element of the first tuple in the `gap` list, which contains the differences between consecutive elements in the list `a`. Since `gap` is a sorted list of tuples, the first tuple represents the smallest gap in `a`. The first element of this tuple is the difference between the two consecutive elements in `a` that form this smallest gap.

Output: **the smallest difference between consecutive elements in the list a**
