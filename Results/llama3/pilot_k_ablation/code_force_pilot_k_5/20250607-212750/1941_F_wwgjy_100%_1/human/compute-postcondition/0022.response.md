Output State: **n is greater than 0, m is greater than 1, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in a, start is the first element of the largest gap in a, end is the second element of the largest gap in a, mid is the midpoint of the largest gap in a, nd is the size of the second largest gap in a if it exists, otherwise 0, res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s and s is less than end, otherwise res remains unchanged, _ is 0, i is 1, remain is the difference between mid and the ith element of b, j is the insertion point for remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is equal to f[k - 1] + b[0] if j equals k, otherwise s is the sum of the (j-1)th element of f and the ith element of b.**
