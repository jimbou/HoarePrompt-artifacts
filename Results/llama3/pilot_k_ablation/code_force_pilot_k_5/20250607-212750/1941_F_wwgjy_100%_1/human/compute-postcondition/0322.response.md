Output: **n, m, k are integers, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[m - 1], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[m - 1] if j is equal to k, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[m - 1] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[m - 1], res is either the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s which is less than end, otherwise res remains infinity. res is not equal to infinity, and the value of res is being printed**
