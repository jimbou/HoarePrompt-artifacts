Postcondition: ***n is an integer, m is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is 0, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[0], and j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order. If j is equal to k, then res is the minimum of the previous value of res and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start < s < end, otherwise res remains infinity, and s is an integer equal to f[k - 1] + b[0]. If j is not equal to k, then res is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd if start is less than s which is less than end, otherwise res is infinity, and s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[0] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[0].***
