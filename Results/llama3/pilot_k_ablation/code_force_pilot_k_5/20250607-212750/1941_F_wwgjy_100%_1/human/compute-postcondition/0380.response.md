Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i+1`, `remain`, `j` are integers or lists of integers as described in the precondition. If `start` is less than `f[j - 1] + b[i]` and `f[j - 1] + b[i]` is less than `end`, then `res` is an integer equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the only possible change being the value of `res`. If the condition `start` < `f[j - 1] + b[i]` < `end` is met, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of the three values `end - (f[j - 1] + b[i])`, `(f[j - 1] + b[i]) - start`, and `nd`. If this condition is not met, then the values of all variables remain unchanged.
