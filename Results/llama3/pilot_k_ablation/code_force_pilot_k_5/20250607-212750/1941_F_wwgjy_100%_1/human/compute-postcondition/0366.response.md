Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i`, `remain`, `j`, `s` is equal to `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` is updated to be the sum of the value at index `j-1` in list `f` and the value at index `i` in list `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for updating `res` is still valid, and if `start` is less than the new value of `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` will be updated accordingly.
