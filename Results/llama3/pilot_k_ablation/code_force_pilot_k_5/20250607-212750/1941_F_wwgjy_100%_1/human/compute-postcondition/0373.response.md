Output State: **n, m, k, a, b, f, gap, start, end, mid, nd, i+1, remain, j, s are integers or lists of integers as described in the precondition. s is now equal to f[j - 1] + b[i]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is an integer equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. If j is equal to k, then s is an integer equal to the sum of the element at index j-1 of f and the second element of b. If j is not equal to k and j is greater than or equal to 1, then s is updated to be the sum of f[j - 1] and b[i]. If start is less than s and s is less than end, then res is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged. remain is now equal to mid - b[i]. j is now equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order.**

In this output state, the value of s has been updated to be the sum of f[j - 1] and b[i]. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, except for the conditional updates to res, which depend on the values of start, end, and s. The value of remain is also updated to be mid - b[i], and j is updated to be the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order.
