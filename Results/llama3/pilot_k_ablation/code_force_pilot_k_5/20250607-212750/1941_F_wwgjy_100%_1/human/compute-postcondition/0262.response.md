Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `mid` is an integer, `nd` is an integer, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, otherwise `res` is infinity, `i` is 0, `remain` is an integer equal to `mid - b[0]`, `j` is an integer equal to the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `j` is not equal to `k`, and `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[0]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is an integer equal to `f[j] + b[0]`. If `start` is less than `s` which is less than `end`, then `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`.***
