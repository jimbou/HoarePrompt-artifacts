Postcondition: **The program prints the first element of the first tuple in the gap list if the current value of res is infinity, otherwise it prints the finite value of res, which is the minimum of its initial value and the maximum of end - s, s - start, and nd for all s that are within the range (start, end) and are equal to f[j - 1] + b[i] if j equals k, otherwise f[j] + b[i] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise f[j - 1] + b[i], where j is the insertion point of mid - b[i] in f to maintain sorted order.**
