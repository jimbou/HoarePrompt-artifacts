Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of integers, `b` is a sorted list of integers, `f` is a sorted list of integers, `gap` is a sorted list of tuples containing the differences between consecutive elements in `a`, `start` is the first element of the largest gap in `a`, `end` is the second element of the largest gap in `a`, `mid` is the midpoint of the largest gap in `a`, `nd` is the size of the second largest gap in `a` if it exists, otherwise 0, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `remain` is `mid - b[i]`, `j` is the insertion point of `remain` in `f` to maintain sorted order, `s` is `f[j] + b[i]` if `j` is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise `s` is `f[j - 1] + b[i]`, `res` is the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd` if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`.***
