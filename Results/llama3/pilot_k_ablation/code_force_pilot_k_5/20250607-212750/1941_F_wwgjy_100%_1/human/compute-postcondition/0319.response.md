Output: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a list of integers, b is a sorted list of integers, f is a sorted list of integers, gap is a sorted list of tuples in descending order, start is an integer, end is an integer, mid is an integer, nd is an integer, i is equal to m, remain is an integer equal to mid - b[m - 1], j is an integer equal to the insertion point of remain in f to maintain sorted order, s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[m - 1] if j is equal to k, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j] + b[m - 1] if j is greater than or equal to 1, otherwise s is an integer equal to f[j - 1] + b[m - 1], and the current value of res is infinity, and the first element of the first tuple in the gap list which is gap[0][0] is being printed**
