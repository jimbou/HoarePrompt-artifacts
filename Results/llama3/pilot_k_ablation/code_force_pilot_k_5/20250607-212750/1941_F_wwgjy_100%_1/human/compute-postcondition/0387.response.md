Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `f`, `gap`, `start`, `end`, `mid`, `nd`, `i+2`, `j`, `remain` are integers or lists of integers as described in the precondition. If `j` is equal to `k`, then `s` is an integer equal to the sum of the element at index `j-1` of `f` and the second element of `b`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is an integer equal to the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. If `j` is not equal to `k` and `j` is greater than or equal to 1, then `s` is updated to be the sum of `f[j - 1]` and `b[i]`. If `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`, then `res` is updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but with the additional information that `res` has been updated to be the minimum of its previous value and the maximum of `end - s`, `s - start`, and `nd`, if `start` is less than `s` and `s` is less than `end`. This update only occurs if `j` is equal to `k` or if `j` is not equal to `k` and `j` is greater than or equal to 1. If neither of these conditions is met, the values of the variables remain unchanged.
