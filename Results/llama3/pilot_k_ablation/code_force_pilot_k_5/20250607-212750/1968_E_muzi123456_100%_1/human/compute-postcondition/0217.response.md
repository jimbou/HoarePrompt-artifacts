Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 5, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_4` which must be at least `n_4 - 1`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_5`, `n_6`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 5, 6, ..., `t`, and the value of `n` which is equal to `n_4` is printed, and `n_4` is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `n_4` is printed followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed, and the value of `i` which is `n - 1` is printed followed by a space, and the value of `i` which is `n - 1` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now `n - 1`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and the input integers in stdin are still the same. The output includes the value of `n` printed three times, followed by the value of `n - 1`, and then the value of `i` (which is `n - 1`) printed twice.
