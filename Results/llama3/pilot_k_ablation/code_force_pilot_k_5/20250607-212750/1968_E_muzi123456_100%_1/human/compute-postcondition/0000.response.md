Output State: **`t` is an integer and is equal to the first input integer, stdin contains one input: t integers (n_1, n_2, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 1, 2, ..., t.**

In this output state, the value of `t` is now known and is equal to the first input integer. The stdin still contains the remaining t integers (n_1, n_2, ..., n_t) where each integer is between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).
