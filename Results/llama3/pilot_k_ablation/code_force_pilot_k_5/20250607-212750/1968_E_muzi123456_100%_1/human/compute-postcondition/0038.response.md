To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `n` is greater than 4, it must also be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables, `t`, `n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_t`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 1, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the first input integer, `n` is greater than 5, `n` is printed, `n` - 1 is printed, where `n` - 1 is equal to `t`, `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t` input integers (`n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 2, 3, ..., `t`**
