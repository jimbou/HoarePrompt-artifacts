Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer and is equal to the first input integer, stdin contains one input: t integers (n_1, n_2, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 1, 2, ..., t.
Code of the loop:
while t:
    t -= 1
    n = int(input())
    print(n, end=' ')
    print(n)
    print(n, end=' ')
    print(n - 1)
    if n == 3:
        print(2, end=' ')
        print(1)
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            print(i, end=' ')
            print(i)
    print(' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer greater than 0, t is equal to the first input integer minus 1, n is an integer, n is equal to the first input integer, stdin contains t input integers (n_2, n_3, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 2, 3, ..., t. The first input integer which is n is printed, and n is printed, and n - 1 is printed, where n - 1 is equal to t. If n is equal to 3, then 2 is printed, and 1 is printed. If n is greater than 3, then the value of i which is equal to n - 1 is printed, and the value of i which is equal to n - 1 is printed, and a space is printed
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0, t is equal to the first input integer minus 2, n is an integer, n is equal to the second input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t, and the value of n - 1 which is equal to the second input integer minus 1 is being printed. If n is 3, then 2 is printed, and 1 is printed. If n is greater than 3, then the loop has finished executing, and the value of i is now equal to n - 1, which is the second input integer minus 1. The loop has printed the values of i from 1 to n - 1. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, and a space is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed. If n is equal to 3, then 2 is being printed followed by a space, and 1 is being printed. If n is greater than or equal to 5, then i is n - 1 and the value of i which is n - 1 is being printed, and a space is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer n_3, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_4, n_5, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 4, 5, ..., t. If n is equal to 3, then the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed again followed by a space, and n_3 - 1 is being printed, and 2 is being printed followed by a space, and 1 is being printed. If n is greater than or equal to 5, then i is n_3 - 1 and the value of i which is n_3 - 1 is being printed, and a space is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed followed by a space, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed. Otherwise, the value of i which is n - 1 is printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is printed, and a space is printed
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 5, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer n_4, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_5, n_6, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 5, 6, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to n_4 is printed, and n_4 is printed, and the value of n which is equal to n_4 is printed followed by a space, and n - 1 is printed. If n is equal to 3, then 2 is printed followed by a space, and 1 is printed. Otherwise, the value of i which is n - 1 is printed followed by a space, and the value of i which is n - 1 is printed, and a space is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
