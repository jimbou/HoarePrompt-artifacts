Based on the precondition, the value of `n` is equal to the input integer `n_3`. The `print` statement is printing the value of `n - 1`.

Since `n` is equal to `n_3`, we can substitute `n_3` for `n` in the expression `n - 1`. Therefore, the `print` statement is printing the value of `n_3 - 1`.

Output: **n_3 - 1 (where n_3 is the input integer)**
