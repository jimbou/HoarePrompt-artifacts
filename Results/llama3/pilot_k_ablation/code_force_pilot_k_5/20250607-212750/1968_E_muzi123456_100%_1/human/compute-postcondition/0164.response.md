To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n - 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 4 to satisfy the loop condition.

The other variables, such as `t`, `n_3`, `n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`, and the printed values, are not directly involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3` and must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t**
