Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed. If n is equal to 3, then 2 is being printed followed by a space, and 1 is being printed. If n is greater than or equal to 5, then i is n - 1 and the value of i which is n - 1 is being printed.***
