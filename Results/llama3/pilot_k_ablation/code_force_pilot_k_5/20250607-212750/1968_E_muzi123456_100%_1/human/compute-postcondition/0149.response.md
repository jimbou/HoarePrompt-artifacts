To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 2, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 1`. 

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t**
