To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved in it.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n - 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the loop head, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 3.

To execute the loop again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.

Since `n` is greater than 3, it must also be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t`, `stdin`, and the printed values are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 2, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the second input integer, `n` is greater than 4, `stdin` contains `t - 2` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`, `i` is 4**
