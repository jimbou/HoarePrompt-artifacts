Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3`, `i` is `n - 1`, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t, and the value of `i` which is `n - 1` is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to the input integer `n_3` is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to the input integer `n_3` is printed again followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now `n - 1`, and the value of `n` is still equal to the input integer `n_3`. The loop has printed the values of `i` from 1 to `n - 1`, and the value of `n` is printed three times followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed. The state of the other variables, such as `t` and the input integers in stdin, remains unchanged.
