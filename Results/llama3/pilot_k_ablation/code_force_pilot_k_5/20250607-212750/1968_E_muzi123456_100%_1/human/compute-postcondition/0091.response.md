According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0, t is equal to the first input integer minus 2, and the value of n - 1 which is equal to the second input integer minus 1 is being printed. Since the loop has printed the values of i from 1 to n - 1, it means that n - 1 is equal to the second input integer minus 1. For the loop to execute again, t must be greater than 0, so the first input integer must be greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is greater than 0, t is equal to the first input integer minus 2 and the first input integer must be greater than 2, n is an integer, n is equal to the second input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t, and the value of n - 1 which is equal to the second input integer minus 1 is being printed.**
