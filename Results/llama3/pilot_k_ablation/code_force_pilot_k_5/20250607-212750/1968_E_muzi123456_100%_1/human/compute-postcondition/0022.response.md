To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the current state.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`.

According to the current state:

* `i` is 1
* `n` is an integer greater than 3
* `n` is printed
* `n` - 1 is printed, where `n` - 1 is equal to `t`
* `n` is not equal to 3
* `t` is an integer greater than 0, and `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 1

To execute the loop again, `i` must be less than `n` - 1. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to increment it to 2. Additionally, `n` must remain greater than 3.

The other variables and conditions in the state (`t`, `n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_t`, stdin, and the printed values) are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 1, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the first input integer, `n` is greater than 3, `n` is printed, `n` - 1 is printed, where `n` - 1 is equal to `t`, `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t` input integers (`n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 2, 3, ..., `t`, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed**
