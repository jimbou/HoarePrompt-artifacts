Output State: **t is equal to 0, n is an integer and is equal to the last input integer, stdin is empty, and the values of n, n, n, n - 1, and the values of i from 1 to n - 1 (if n is greater than 3) or 2 and 1 (if n is equal to 3) are printed, followed by a space.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the variable t will be equal to 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The variable n will be equal to the last input integer. The standard input (stdin) will be empty, as all the input integers will have been processed. The output will consist of the values of n, n, n, n - 1, and the values of i from 1 to n - 1 (if n is greater than 3) or 2 and 1 (if n is equal to 3), followed by a space.
