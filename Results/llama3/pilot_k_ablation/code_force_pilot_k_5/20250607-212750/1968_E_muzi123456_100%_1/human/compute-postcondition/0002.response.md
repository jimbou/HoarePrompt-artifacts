Output State: **t is an integer greater than 0, t is equal to the first input integer minus 1, n is an integer, n is equal to the first input integer, stdin contains t input integers (n_2, n_3, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 2, 3, ..., t**

Explanation:
The first line decrements the value of `t` by 1, so `t` becomes the first input integer minus 1. The second line reads the first input integer from stdin and assigns it to `n`. Since `t` is equal to the first input integer, `n` is now equal to the original value of `t`. The remaining input integers (n_2, n_3, ..., n_t) are still in stdin, and their values are between 2 and 10^3 (inclusive).
