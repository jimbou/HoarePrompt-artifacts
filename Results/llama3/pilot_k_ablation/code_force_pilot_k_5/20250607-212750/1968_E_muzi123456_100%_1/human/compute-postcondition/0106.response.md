The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 3 and i is now 1. 
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer and is greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed, `i` is 1**
