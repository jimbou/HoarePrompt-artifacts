Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer n_3, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_4, n_5, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 4, 5, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed again followed by a space, and n_3 - 1 is being printed. If n_3 is equal to 3, then 2 is being printed followed by a space, and 1 is being printed. If n_3 is greater than or equal to 5, then i is n_3 - 1 and the value of i which is n_3 - 1 is being printed, and a space is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed followed by a space, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    print(i, end=' ')
    print(i)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3` and must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t, and 1 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 1 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3` and must be greater than 3, `i` is 2, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t, and 1 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3` and must be greater than 4, `i` is 3, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t, and 1 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 2 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3` and must be greater than 4, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t, and the value of `i` which is 4 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_3` and must be greater than 5, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_4`, `n_5`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i = 4, 5, ..., t, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
