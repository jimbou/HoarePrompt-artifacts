Based on the initial state, we can determine the output of the print statement as follows:

The variable `n` is equal to the first input integer. Since `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 1, we can infer that `n` is the first input integer.

The `print` statement prints the value of `n` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Therefore, the output will be the value of the first input integer, which is `n`, followed by a space.

Output: **n (where n is the first input integer)**
