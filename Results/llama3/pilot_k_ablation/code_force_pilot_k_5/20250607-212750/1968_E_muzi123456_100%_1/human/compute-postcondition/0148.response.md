Output: **t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer n_3, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_4, n_5, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 4, 5, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed again followed by a space, and n_3 - 1 is being printed. If n_3 is equal to 3, then 2 is being printed followed by a space, and 1 is being printed. If n_3 is greater than or equal to 5, then i is n_3 - 1 and the value of i which is n_3 - 1 is being printed, and a space is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed followed by a space, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer n_3 is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed, and 2 is printed followed by a space, and 1 is printed**
