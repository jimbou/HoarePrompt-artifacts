Based on the initial state, we know that `t` is an integer greater than 0, and it is equal to the first input integer minus 1. We also know that `n` is an integer, and it is equal to the first input integer.

The print statement `print(n - 1)` will print the value of `n` minus 1.

Since `t` is equal to `n` minus 1, we can substitute `t` into the print statement. Therefore, the print statement is equivalent to `print(t)`.

However, the problem statement does not provide the exact value of `t` or `n`. But we know that `n` is the first input integer, and `t` is `n` minus 1.

Therefore, the print statement will print the value of `t`, which is `n` minus 1.

Output: **n - 1 (where n is the first input integer)**
