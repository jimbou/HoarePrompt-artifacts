The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0. Since t is already greater than 0, no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 4, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer n_3, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_4, n_5, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 4, 5, ..., t**
