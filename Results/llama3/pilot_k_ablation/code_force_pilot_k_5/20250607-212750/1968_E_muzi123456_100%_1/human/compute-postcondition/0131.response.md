Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer and is greater than or equal to 5, `stdin` contains `t - 2` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_(t-1)`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t-1`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the value of `i` which is `n - 1` is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains unchanged, `n` is still equal to the input integer and is greater than or equal to 5, and `stdin` contains `t - 2` input integers. The loop variable `i` has reached its final value of `n - 1`, and this value is being printed.
