Output State: **t is greater than 0, t is equal to the first input integer minus 2, n is an integer, n is equal to the second input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t.**

Explanation:

The first line `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially equal to the first input integer minus 1, it is now equal to the first input integer minus 2.

The second line `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the second input integer to `n`. Since `n` was initially equal to the first input integer, it is now equal to the second input integer.

The stdin initially contained `t` input integers, but after the second line, one integer has been consumed, leaving `t - 1` input integers.

All other information from the precondition remains valid, including the range of values for `n_i` and the fact that `t` is greater than 0.
