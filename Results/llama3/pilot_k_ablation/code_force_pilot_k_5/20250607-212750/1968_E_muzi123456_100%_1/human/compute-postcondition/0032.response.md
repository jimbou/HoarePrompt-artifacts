To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, n - 1):`. The objects involved are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 4.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 4.

The value of `n` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 1, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the first input integer, `n` is greater than 4, `n` is printed, `n` - 1 is printed, where `n` - 1 is equal to `t`, `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t` input integers (`n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 2, 3, ..., `t`, and the value of `i` which is 4 is printed, and this is printed: 4, and the value of `i` which is 4 is printed, and the value of `i` which is 4 is printed again, and the value of `i` which is 4 is printed again**
