The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 2, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the second input integer, `stdin` contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`, and the value of `n - 1` which is equal to the second input integer minus 1 is being printed. However, these states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is at least 3 and `i` is now 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 2, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the second input integer, `n` is at least 3, `stdin` contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`, the value of `n - 1` which is equal to the second input integer minus 1 is being printed, `i` is 1**
