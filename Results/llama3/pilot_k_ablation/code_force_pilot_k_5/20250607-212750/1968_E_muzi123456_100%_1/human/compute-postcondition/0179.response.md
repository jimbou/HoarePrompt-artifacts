Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 5, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer n_4, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_5, n_6, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 5, 6, ..., t**

In this output state, the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and the value of `n` has been updated to the next input integer `n_4`. The stdin now contains `t - 1` input integers, starting from `n_5` to `n_t`. The range of values for `n_i` remains the same, from 2 to 10^3.
