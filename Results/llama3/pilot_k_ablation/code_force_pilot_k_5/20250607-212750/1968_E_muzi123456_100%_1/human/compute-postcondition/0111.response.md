To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the variables involved.

The loop head is: `for i in range(1, n - 1):`

The variables involved are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3
* `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer and is greater than or equal to 3
* `stdin` contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`
* `i` is 1

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `i` and `n`.

Since `i` is currently 1, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 2.

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 3, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 to satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer and is greater than or equal to 4, `stdin` contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`, `i` is 2**
