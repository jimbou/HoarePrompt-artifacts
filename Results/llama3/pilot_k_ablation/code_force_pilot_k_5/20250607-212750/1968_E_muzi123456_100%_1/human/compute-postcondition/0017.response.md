The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the first input integer, `n` is printed, and `n` - 1 is printed, where `n` - 1 is equal to `t`, and `n` is not equal to 3. So for the loop to be executed  `n` must be greater than 3 and `i` is 1.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 1, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the first input integer, `n` is greater than 3, `n` is printed, `n` - 1 is printed, where `n` - 1 is equal to `t`, `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t` input integers (`n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 2, 3, ..., `t`**
