To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is at least 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `n` is at least 4, it must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `t` and the contents of `stdin` do not affect the loop head, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 5, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_4` which must be at least 5, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_5`, `n_6`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 5, 6, ..., `t`**
