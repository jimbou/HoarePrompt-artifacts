To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n - 1`). 

Given the initial state, we know that `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_4`. However, we don't have a specific value for `n_4`. We can infer that `n_4` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute. 

Additionally, since `i` is the loop variable, we can set its initial value to 1, which is the starting point of the range.

The other variables and states mentioned in the initial state (e.g., `t`, `stdin`, `n_5`, `n_6`, ..., `n_t`) are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 5, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_4` which must be at least 3, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_5`, `n_6`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 5, 6, ..., `t`, and the value of `n` which is equal to `n_4` is printed, and `n_4` is printed, and the value of `n` which is equal to `n_4` is printed followed by a space, and `n - 1` is printed**
