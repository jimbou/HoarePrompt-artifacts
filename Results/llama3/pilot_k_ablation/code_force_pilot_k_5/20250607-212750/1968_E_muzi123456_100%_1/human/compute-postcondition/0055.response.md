Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is an integer equal to the second input integer. The `print` statement is printing the value of `n - 1`.

Since `n` is equal to the second input integer, we can describe its value as the second input integer. Therefore, `n - 1` will be one less than the second input integer.

Output: **one less than the second input integer**
