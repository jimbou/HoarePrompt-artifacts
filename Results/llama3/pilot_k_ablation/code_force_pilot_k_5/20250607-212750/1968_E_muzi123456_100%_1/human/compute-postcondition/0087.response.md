Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 2, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the second input integer, `n` is greater than 5, `stdin` contains `t - 2` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`, `i` is `n - 1`, and the value of `i` which is `n - 1` is printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n - 1`, which is the second input integer minus 1. The loop has printed the values of `i` from 1 to `n - 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
