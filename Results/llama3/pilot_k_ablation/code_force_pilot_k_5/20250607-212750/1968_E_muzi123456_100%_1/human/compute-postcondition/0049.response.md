Based on the precondition, we know that `n` is an integer equal to the second input integer.

The `print` statement is printing the value of `n` followed by a space (due to the `end=' '` argument).

Since `n` is an integer equal to the second input integer, the output will be the value of the second input integer.

Output: **the second input integer**
