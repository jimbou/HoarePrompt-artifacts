The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0 and the first input integer must be greater than 3.

State: **t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3 and the first input integer must be greater than 3, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed, and the value of n which is equal to the input integer is being printed again followed by a space, and n - 1 is being printed. If n is equal to 3, then 2 is being printed followed by a space, and 1 is being printed. If n is greater than or equal to 5, then i is n - 1 and the value of i which is n - 1 is being printed, and a space is being printed**
