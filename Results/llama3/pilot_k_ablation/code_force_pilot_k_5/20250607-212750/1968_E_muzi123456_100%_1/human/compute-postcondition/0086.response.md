Output State: `t` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 2, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the second input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `stdin` contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`, the value of `n - 1` which is equal to the second input integer minus 1 is being printed, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, and the value of `i` which is `n - 1` is being printed.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n - 1`. The value of `n - 1` is being printed, and the value of `i` which is `n - 1` is also being printed. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
