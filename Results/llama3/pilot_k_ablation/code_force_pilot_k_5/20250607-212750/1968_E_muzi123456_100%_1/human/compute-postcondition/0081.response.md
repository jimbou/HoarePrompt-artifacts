The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 2, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the second input integer, `n` is greater than 5, `stdin` contains `t - 2` input integers (`n_3`, `n_4`, ..., `n_t`) where `2 <= n_i <= 10^3` for `i = 3, 4, ..., t`, `i` is 5**
