Based on the initial state, the code `print(2, end=' ')` will print the number 2 followed by a space.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* The `print` function is called with the argument `2`, which is a literal integer value.
* The `end` parameter is set to `' '`, which means that a space character will be printed after the value of `2`.

Since `2` is a literal value, it will be printed as is. The `end` parameter only affects the trailing character, which in this case is a space.

Therefore, the output will be the number 2 followed by a space.

Output: **2 **
