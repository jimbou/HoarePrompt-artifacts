To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 3.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 3, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is equal to the first input integer minus 1, `n` is an integer, `n` is equal to the first input integer, `n` is greater than 4, `n` is printed, `n` - 1 is printed, where `n` - 1 is equal to `t`, `n` is not equal to 3, `i` is 3, stdin contains `t` input integers (`n_2`, `n_3`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 2, 3, ..., `t`, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed, and this is printed: 3, and the value of `i` which is 3 is printed**
