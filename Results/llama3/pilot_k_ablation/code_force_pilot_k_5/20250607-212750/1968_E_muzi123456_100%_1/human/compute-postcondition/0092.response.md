Output State: **t is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 3, n is an integer and is equal to the input integer, stdin contains t - 1 input integers (n_3, n_4, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 3, 4, ..., t.**

The first line decrements `t` by 1, making it equal to the first input integer minus 3. The second line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`, which is equal to the input integer. The value of `n - 1` is not affected by the code and remains equal to the second input integer minus 1. The stdin contains `t - 1` input integers, which are the remaining integers after the first two inputs. The range of these integers remains the same, from 2 to 10^3.
