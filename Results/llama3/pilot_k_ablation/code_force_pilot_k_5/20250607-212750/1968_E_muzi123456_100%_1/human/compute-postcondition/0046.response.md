Output: **t is an integer greater than 0, t is equal to the first input integer minus 1, n is an integer, n is equal to the first input integer, stdin contains t input integers (n_2, n_3, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 2, 3, ..., t. The first input integer which is n is printed, and n is printed, and n - 1 is printed, where n - 1 is equal to t. If n is equal to 3, then 2 is printed, and 1 is printed. If n is greater than 3, then the value of i which is equal to n - 1 is printed, and the value of i which is equal to n - 1 is printed, and a space is printed**
