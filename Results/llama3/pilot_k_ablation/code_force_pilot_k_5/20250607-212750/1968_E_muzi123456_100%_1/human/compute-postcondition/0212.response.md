The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 5, and `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is greater than 0 and is equal to the first input integer minus 5, `n` is an integer and is equal to the input integer `n_4` which must be at least 6, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t - 1` input integers (`n_5`, `n_6`, ..., `n_t`) where 2 <= `n_i` <= 10^3 for `i` = 5, 6, ..., `t`, and the value of `i` which is 5 is being printed**
