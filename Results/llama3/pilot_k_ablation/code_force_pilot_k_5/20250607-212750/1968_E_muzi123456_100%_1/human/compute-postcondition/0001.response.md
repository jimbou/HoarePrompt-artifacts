To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition that must be met for the loop to execute. The loop condition is simply `while t:`, which means the loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is an integer and is equal to the first input integer, and stdin contains one input: `t` integers, we need to ensure that `t` is not zero for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state of `t` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than zero. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer, is equal to the first input integer, and is greater than 0, stdin contains one input: `t` integers (n_1, n_2, ..., n_t) where 2 <= n_i <= 10^3 for i = 1, 2, ..., t**
