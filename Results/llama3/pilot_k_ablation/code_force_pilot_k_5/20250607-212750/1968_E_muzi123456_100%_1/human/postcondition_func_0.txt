The function reads a series of integers from standard input, where the first integer (t) represents the number of subsequent integers to process. For each subsequent integer (n), it prints a sequence of numbers: n, n, n, n-1, and then either the numbers 2 and 1 (if n is 3) or the numbers from 1 to n-1 (if n is greater than 3). The function continues this process until all integers have been processed (i.e., until t reaches 0), at which point standard input is empty.
