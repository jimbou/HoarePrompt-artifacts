Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer n as input and prints a sequence of numbers that represent the coordinates of the cells.

The program's logic is based on the examples provided in the problem description. For n = 2, the program prints the coordinates (n, n) and (n, n-1), which is a valid solution. For n = 3, the program prints the coordinates (n, n), (n, n-1), and (2, 1), which is also a valid solution.

For n > 3, the program prints the coordinates (n, n), (n, n-1), and then the coordinates (i, i) for i ranging from 1 to n-1. This is also a valid solution, as it ensures that the Manhattan distance between any pair of cells is distinct.

The program's output matches the expected output provided in the problem description, and it correctly handles the edge cases for n = 2 and n = 3.

Correctness: **True**
