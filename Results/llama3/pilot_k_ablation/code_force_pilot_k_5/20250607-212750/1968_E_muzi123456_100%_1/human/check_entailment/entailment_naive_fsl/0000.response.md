Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, when n = 4, the program outputs:

4 4
4 3
1 1
1 2

However, this arrangement does not maximize the size of H. A correct arrangement for n = 4 would be:

1 1
1 3
4 3
4 4

This arrangement has a larger size of H, which is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}. The program does not produce this arrangement, and therefore, it is incorrect.

In general, the program seems to be trying to construct a specific arrangement for each n, but it does not seem to be based on a correct algorithm for maximizing the size of H. The program's output for larger values of n may also be incorrect.
