Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances between any pair of cells in an n x n grid. The program takes an integer t as input, representing the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it takes an integer n as input, representing the size of the grid.

The program then prints the coordinates of the cells that maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances. The coordinates are printed in a specific pattern, which is designed to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

The program uses a while loop to iterate over the test cases, and for each test case, it prints the coordinates of the cells in a specific pattern. The pattern is designed to ensure that the Manhattan distances between any pair of cells are distinct.

The program handles the case where n is equal to 3 separately, as this is a special case that requires a different pattern to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Overall, the program is designed to solve the problem correctly, and it uses a specific pattern to maximize the size of the set of distinct Manhattan distances.

Correctness: **True**
