The `print` statement will print the minimum and maximum values between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the minimum value will be the smaller of the two, and the maximum value will be the larger of the two.

Output: **[minimum of a and b], [maximum of a and b] (where a and b are integers between 0 and 9)**
