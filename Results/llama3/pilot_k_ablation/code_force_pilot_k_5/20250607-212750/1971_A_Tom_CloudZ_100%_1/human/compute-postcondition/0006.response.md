Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 99, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are being printed, where the minimum value is the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value is the larger of `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two space-separated integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains t-3 lines of input, as one line has been consumed by the input operation. The values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are still being printed, but now they are based on the new values of `a` and `b`.
