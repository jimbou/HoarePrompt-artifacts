The code prints the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` are integers between 0 and 9, the minimum value will be the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value will be the larger of `a` and `b`.

Output: **the minimum value of a and b, the maximum value of a and b (where a and b are integers between 0 and 9)**
