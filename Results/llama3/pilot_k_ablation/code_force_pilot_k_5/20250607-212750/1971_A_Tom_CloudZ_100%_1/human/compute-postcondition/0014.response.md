Output State: **`t` is an integer between 4 and 99, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 3, stdin contains t-6 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are being printed, where the minimum value is the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value is the larger of `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` have been updated to the two space-separated integers read from the input. The minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are being printed, which means that the smaller of `a` and `b` is being printed as the minimum value, and the larger of `a` and `b` is being printed as the maximum value. The other variables, `t` and `_`, remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-6 lines, as one line has been read to update the values of `a` and `b`.
