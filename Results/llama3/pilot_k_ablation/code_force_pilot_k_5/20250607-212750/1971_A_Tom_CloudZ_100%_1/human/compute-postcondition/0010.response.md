Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 99, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 2, stdin contains t-4 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are being printed, where the minimum value is the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value is the larger of `a` and `b`.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_` remain the same as in the initial state. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two space-separated integers read from the input, which are between 0 and 9. The stdin now contains t-4 lines of input, as one line has been read. The minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are still being printed, with the minimum value being the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value being the larger of `a` and `b`.
