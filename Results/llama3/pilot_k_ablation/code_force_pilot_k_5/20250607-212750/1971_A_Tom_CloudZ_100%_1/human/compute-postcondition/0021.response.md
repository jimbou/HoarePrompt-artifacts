Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 100, a is an integer between 0 and 9, b is an integer between 0 and 9, _ is t-1, stdin is empty, and the minimum and maximum values of a and b are being printed, where the minimum value is the smaller of a and b, and the maximum value is the larger of a and b.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the value of `t` will be between 1 and 100, `a` and `b` will be between 0 and 9, and `_` will be `t-1`. The stdin will be empty as all the lines will have been processed. The minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` will be printed, where the minimum value is the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value is the larger of `a` and `b`.
