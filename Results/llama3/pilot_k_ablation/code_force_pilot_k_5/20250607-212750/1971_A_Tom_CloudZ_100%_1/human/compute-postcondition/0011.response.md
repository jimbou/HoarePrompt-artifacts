Based on the precondition, we can determine the values of `a` and `b` as follows:

* `a` is an integer between 0 and 9.
* `b` is an integer between 0 and 9.

The `print` statement is printing the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b`. The minimum value is the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value is the larger of `a` and `b`.

Since the exact values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the minimum and maximum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b`.

Output: **minimum value (which is the smaller of a and b), maximum value (which is the larger of a and b)**
