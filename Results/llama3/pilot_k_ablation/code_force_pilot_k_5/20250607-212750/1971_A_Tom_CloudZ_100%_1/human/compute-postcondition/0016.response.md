Output: **`t` is an integer between 4 and 99, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 3, stdin contains t-6 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are being printed, where the minimum value is the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value is the larger of `a` and `b`.**
