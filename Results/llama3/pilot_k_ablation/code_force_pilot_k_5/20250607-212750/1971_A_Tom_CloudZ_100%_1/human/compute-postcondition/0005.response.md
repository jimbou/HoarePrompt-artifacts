The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0, `t` is an integer between 1 and 99. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 99, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 1, stdin contains t-2 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), and the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b` are being printed, where the minimum value is the smaller of `a` and `b`, and the maximum value is the larger of `a` and `b`.**
