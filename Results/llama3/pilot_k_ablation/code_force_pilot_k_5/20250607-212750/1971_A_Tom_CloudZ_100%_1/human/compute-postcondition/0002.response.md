Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 99, `a` is an integer between 0 and 9, `b` is an integer between 0 and 9, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9)**

In this output state, the value of `t` is still an integer between 1 and 100, but since one line of input has been consumed, the number of remaining lines in stdin is reduced by 1, making it between 1 and 99. The values of `a` and `b` are assigned the two space-separated integers from the first line of input, which are between 0 and 9. The value of `_` remains unchanged at 0. The stdin now contains `t-1` lines of input, each containing two space-separated integers between 0 and 9.
