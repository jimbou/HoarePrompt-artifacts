The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100, which ensures that the loop will execute, so it does not need to be adjusted. `_` is a throwaway variable, so it does not need to be adjusted either.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 100, stdin contains t lines each containing two space-separated integers x and y (0 <= x, y <= 9), `_` is 0**
