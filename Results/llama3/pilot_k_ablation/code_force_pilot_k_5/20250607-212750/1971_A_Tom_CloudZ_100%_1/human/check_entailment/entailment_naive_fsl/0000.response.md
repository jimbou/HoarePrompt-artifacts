Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers x and y as input and outputs the minimum and maximum of the two numbers. The program uses the built-in min() and max() functions in Python, which correctly handle all possible cases, including when x and y are equal. The program also correctly handles the input format, where the first line contains the number of test cases, and each subsequent line contains two space-separated integers.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly handles all possible inputs, including edge cases such as when x and y are equal, or when x or y is 0. The program also correctly handles the output format, printing the minimum and maximum values separated by a space.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
