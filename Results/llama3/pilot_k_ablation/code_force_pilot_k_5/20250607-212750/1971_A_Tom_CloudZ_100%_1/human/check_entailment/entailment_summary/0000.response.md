Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the minimum and maximum values of pairs of integers. The program first reads the number of test cases (t) and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads a pair of integers (a and b) and prints the minimum and maximum values of the pair using the built-in min() and max() functions.

The program's logic is correct and aligns with the problem description. It correctly reads the input, processes the data, and produces the expected output. The execution summary also confirms that the program behaves as expected.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
