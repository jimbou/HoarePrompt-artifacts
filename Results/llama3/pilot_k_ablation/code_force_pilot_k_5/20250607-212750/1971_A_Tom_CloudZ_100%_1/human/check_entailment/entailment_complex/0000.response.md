Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to read a series of pairs of integers from standard input, where the number of pairs is specified by an initial integer input. It then prints the minimum and maximum values of each pair.

The program first reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads two space-separated integers `a` and `b`. It then uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values of `a` and `b`, respectively, and prints them.

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the input and output as specified in the problem description. The use of `min` and `max` functions ensures that the program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values of each pair, regardless of the order in which they are input.

The program also handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `a` and `b` are equal, or when `a` or `b` is 0.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
