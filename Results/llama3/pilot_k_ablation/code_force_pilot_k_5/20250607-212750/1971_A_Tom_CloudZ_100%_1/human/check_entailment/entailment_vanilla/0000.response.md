Reasoning:

1. The problem requires us to determine the minimum and maximum of two given integers x and y, and output them in that order.
2. The program defines a function `func()` that reads the number of test cases `t` and then iterates over each test case.
3. For each test case, it reads two integers `a` and `b` using the `map()` function and splits them into separate variables.
4. The program then uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to find the minimum and maximum of `a` and `b`, respectively.
5. Finally, it prints the minimum and maximum values separated by a space.

Correctness: **True**
