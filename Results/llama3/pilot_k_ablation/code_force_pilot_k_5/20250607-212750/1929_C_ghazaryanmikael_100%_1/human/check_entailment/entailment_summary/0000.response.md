Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement to determine whether Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants.

The program calculates the maximum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win, which is the sum of the minimum bets he needs to make in case of consecutive losses. This is done by iteratively adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to `s`, where `s` is the current amount of coins and `k` is the multiplier for the bet.

The program then checks if the initial amount of coins `a` is greater than or equal to the calculated maximum amount `s`. If it is, the program prints 'YES', indicating that Sasha can guarantee having as many coins as he wants. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `x` is 1, in which case Sasha can only afford to lose once. It also correctly handles the case when `k` is 2, in which case Sasha's bet is doubled in case of a win.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately solves the problem.

Correctness: **True**
