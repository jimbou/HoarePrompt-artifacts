Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program is correct because it accurately implements the strategy described in the problem statement. The key insight is that Sasha can guarantee a win by placing bets such that he can recover from a sequence of losses. The program calculates the minimum amount of coins Sasha needs to have in order to guarantee a win, which is the sum of the first x+1 terms of the sequence 1, 1 + 1/(k-1), 1 + 2/(k-1), ..., 1 + x/(k-1).

The program then checks if Sasha's initial amount of coins is greater than or equal to this minimum amount. If it is, then Sasha can guarantee a win, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where x=1 or k=2. It also correctly handles the case where Sasha's initial amount of coins is very large, as the calculation of the minimum amount of coins is done using integer arithmetic, which avoids overflow issues.

Overall, the program is correct and accurately solves the problem.
