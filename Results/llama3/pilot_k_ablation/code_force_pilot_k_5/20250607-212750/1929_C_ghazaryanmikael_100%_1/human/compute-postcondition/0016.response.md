Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is 1, stdin is empty, i is x-1**

The code block first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to k, x, and a, respectively. This empties stdin. The second line assigns 1 to s, overwriting its previous value. The values of i and the printed output ('YES' or 'NO') are not affected by the code block.
