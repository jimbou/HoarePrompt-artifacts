Output State: **k is an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a is an integer, s is increased by at least x times s // (k - 1) + 1, i is x, stdin is empty, and 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'NO' is printed**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that k remains an integer, x is greater than or equal to 0, a remains an integer, s is increased by at least x times s // (k - 1) + 1, i is x, stdin is empty, and 'YES' is printed if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'NO' is printed.
