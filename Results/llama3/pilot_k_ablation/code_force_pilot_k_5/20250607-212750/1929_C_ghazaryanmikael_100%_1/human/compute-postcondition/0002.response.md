To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. The loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `x` to be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` must be greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 0**
