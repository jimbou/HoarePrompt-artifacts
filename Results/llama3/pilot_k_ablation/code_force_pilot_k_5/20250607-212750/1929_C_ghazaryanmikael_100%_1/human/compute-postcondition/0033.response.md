Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1`, `i` is 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 2 plus the integer division of `s` by `k-1`. The integer division `s // (k-1)` means that the result will be an integer, truncating any fractional part. The other variables `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged, and the stdin is still empty.
