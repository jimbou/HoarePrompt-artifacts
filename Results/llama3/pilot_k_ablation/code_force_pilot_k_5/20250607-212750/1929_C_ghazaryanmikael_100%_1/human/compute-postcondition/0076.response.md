Functionality: **The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers: k, x, and a. It then calculates a value s by iteratively adding s // (k - 1) + 1 to itself x times, starting from an initial value of 1. The function prints 'YES' if the calculated value s is less than or equal to a, and 'NO' otherwise. The function repeats this process for each test case in the input, until the input is exhausted.**
