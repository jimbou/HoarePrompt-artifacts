Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is an integer, `i` is 4, if `k` is 1 then `s` is 6, if `k` is 2 then `s` is 7, if `k` is 3 then `s` is 7, if `k` is 4 or more then `s` is 6 + 2*s/(`k`-1)**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated based on the initial state conditions. If `k` is 1, `s` becomes 6 (5 + 1). If `k` is 2, `s` becomes 7 (6 + 1). If `k` is 3, `s` becomes 7 (6 + 1). If `k` is 4 or more, `s` becomes 6 + 2*s/(`k`-1), which is an updated formula based on the initial state condition. The values of `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
