Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 3, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by at least `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is 3, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its original value. The other variables, `k`, `x`, `a`, and `i`, remain unchanged, and stdin is still empty.
