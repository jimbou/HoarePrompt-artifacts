Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, divided by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, ..., plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `x-1`.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is:

* `k` remains an integer.
* `x` is greater than or equal to its initial value.
* `a` remains an integer.
* `s` is calculated by iteratively adding 1 plus the integer division of the previous value of `s` by `k-1`, starting from 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`. This process is repeated `x` times.
* `stdin` remains empty.
* `i` is set to `x-1`.

Note that the value of `s` is calculated by recursively applying the formula `s += s // (k - 1) + 1` for `x` iterations, starting from the initial value of `s` which is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`.
