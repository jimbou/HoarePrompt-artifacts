Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is an integer, `i` is 3, if `k` is 1 then `s` is 5, if `k` is 2 then `s` is 6, if `k` is 3 then `s` is 6, if `k` is 4 or more then `s` is 6 + `s`/(`k`-1)**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, then `s` is 5. If `k` is 2, then `s` is 6. If `k` is 3, then `s` is 6. If `k` is 4 or more, then `s` is 6 plus the result of the division of `s` by `k-1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
