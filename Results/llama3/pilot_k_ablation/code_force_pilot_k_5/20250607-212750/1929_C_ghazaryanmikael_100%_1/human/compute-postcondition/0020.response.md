Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated by adding the integer division of `s` by `k-1` and 1 to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged.
