Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 4, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, divided by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4**

In natural language, the output state is: `k` remains an integer, `x` remains greater than 4, `a` remains an integer, `s` is updated to be the original value of `s` plus the integer division of the original value of `s` by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` remains empty, and `i` remains 4.
