Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, divided by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: `k` is still an integer, `x` is still greater than 2, `a` is still an integer, `s` is updated to be the sum of its original value and the integer division of its original value by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` is still empty, and `i` is still 2.
