Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `i` is 1, if `k` is 1 then `s` is 3, if `k` is 2 then `s` is 4, if `k` is 3 or more then `s` is 4**

In this output state, the value of `s` is updated based on the value of `k`. If `k` is 1, then `s` becomes 3 (2 + 2 // (1 - 1) + 1). If `k` is 2, then `s` becomes 4 (2 + 2 // (2 - 1) + 1). If `k` is 3 or more, then `s` becomes 4 (3 + 3 // (k - 1) + 1). The values of `x`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged.
