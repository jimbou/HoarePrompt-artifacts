The code prints 'YES' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of `s` is `x` plus `x` times the integer division of `s` by `k-1`. The value of `i` is `x-1`. However, the value of `i` is not used in the print statement.

Since the exact values of `a`, `x`, `k`, and `s` are not provided, we can't determine the exact output of the print statement. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the comparison of `a` and `s`.

Output: **YES if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise NO**
