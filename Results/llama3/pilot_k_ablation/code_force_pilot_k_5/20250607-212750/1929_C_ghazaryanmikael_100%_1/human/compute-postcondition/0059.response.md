Output: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` + 1 if `k` is 1, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 2, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 3, `s` is `x` + 2 + (`x`-3)*`s`/(`k`-1) if `k` is 4 or more, `i` is `x`, stdin is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or not.**
