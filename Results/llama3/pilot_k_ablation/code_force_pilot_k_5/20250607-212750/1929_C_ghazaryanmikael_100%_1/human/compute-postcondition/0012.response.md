Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` times `s` divided by `k-1` plus `x`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `x-1`.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `s` will be the sum of `x` times the initial value of `s` divided by `k-1` plus `x`. The value of `i` will be `x-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `x` times. The values of `k`, `a`, and `stdin` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the loop.
