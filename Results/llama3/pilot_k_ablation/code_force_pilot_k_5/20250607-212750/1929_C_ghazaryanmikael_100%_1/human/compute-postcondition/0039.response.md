Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 3, `a` is an integer, `s` is 7 plus four times the integer division of `s` by `k-1`, `i` is 3, stdin is empty**

The value of `s` is updated by adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to its previous value. Since `s` was initially 6 plus three times the integer division of `s` by `k-1`, the new value of `s` is 7 plus four times the integer division of `s` by `k-1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
