The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `x` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `x` must be greater than 4.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 4, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, divided by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4**
