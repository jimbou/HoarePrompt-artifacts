Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t sets of three space-separated integers k, x, and a (2 <= k <= 30, 1 <= x <= 100, 1 <= a <= 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    k, x, a = map(int, input().split())
    s = 1
    for i in range(x):
        s += s // (k - 1) + 1
    print('YES' if a >= s else 'NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` times `s` divided by `k-1` plus `x`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `x-1`, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` otherwise 'NO' is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `k` is an integer, `x` is greater than or equal to `x`, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1`, plus the integer division of 2 plus the integer division of 1 by `k-1` by `k-1` plus 1, divided by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, ..., plus the integer division of the same expression by `k-1` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `x-1`, and either 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or 'NO' is printed if `a` is less than `s`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is x plus x times the integer division of s by k-1, i is x-1, stdin is empty, and this is printed: 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'NO'

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` + 1 if `k` is 1, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 2, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 3, `s` is `x` + 2 + (`x`-3)*`s`/(`k`-1) if `k` is 4 or more, `i` is `x`, stdin is empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or not.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `k` is an integer, `x` is greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an integer, `s` is increased by at least `x` times `s // (k - 1) + 1`, `i` is `x`, stdin is empty, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s`, otherwise 'NO' is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
