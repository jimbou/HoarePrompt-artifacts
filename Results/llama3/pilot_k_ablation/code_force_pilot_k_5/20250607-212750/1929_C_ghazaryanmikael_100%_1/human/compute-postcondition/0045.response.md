To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as there is input to read from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty.

The other variables `k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, and `i` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is x plus x times the integer division of s by k-1, `i` is x-1, `stdin` is not empty, and this is printed: 'YES' if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise 'NO'**
