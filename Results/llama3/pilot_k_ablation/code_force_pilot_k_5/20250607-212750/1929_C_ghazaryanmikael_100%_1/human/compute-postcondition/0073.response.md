The code prints 'YES' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. Where `a` is an integer and `s` is increased by at least `x` times `s // (k - 1) + 1`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 0.
Output: **YES if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise NO (where a is an integer and s is increased by at least x times s // (k - 1) + 1)**
