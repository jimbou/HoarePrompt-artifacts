Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is 6 plus 3 times `s` divided by `k-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 6 plus 3 times `s` divided by `k-1`, which is the result of the expression `s += s // (k - 1) + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
