The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 3.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 3, `a` is an integer, `s` is 6 plus three times the integer division of `s` by `k-1`, `i` is 3, stdin is empty**
