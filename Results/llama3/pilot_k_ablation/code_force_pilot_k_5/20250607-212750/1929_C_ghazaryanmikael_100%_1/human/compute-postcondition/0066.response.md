The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `x`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than 2.
State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 2, `a` is an integer, `s` is 4 plus 2 times `s // (k - 1)`, `i` is 2, stdin is empty**
