Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is x plus x times the integer division of s by k-1, i is x-1, stdin is empty**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that k remains an integer, x remains an integer, a remains an integer, s is updated to be x plus x times the integer division of s by k-1, i is updated to be x-1, and stdin remains empty.
