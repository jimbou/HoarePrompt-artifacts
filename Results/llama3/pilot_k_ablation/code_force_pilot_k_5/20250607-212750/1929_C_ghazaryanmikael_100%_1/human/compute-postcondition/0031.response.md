Output State: **k is an integer, x is an integer, a is an integer, s is 1, i is x-1, stdin is empty**

The code first reads three integers from stdin and assigns them to k, x, and a, respectively. This empties stdin. The second line assigns 1 to s, overwriting its previous value. The value of i remains unchanged as x-1. The comparison and printing of 'YES' or 'NO' based on the values of a and s is not executed as it is not part of the provided code snippet.
