Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 4 plus 2 times `s // (k - 1)`, `i` is 1, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 4 plus 2 times `s // (k - 1)`, which is the result of adding `s // (k - 1) + 1` to the original value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
