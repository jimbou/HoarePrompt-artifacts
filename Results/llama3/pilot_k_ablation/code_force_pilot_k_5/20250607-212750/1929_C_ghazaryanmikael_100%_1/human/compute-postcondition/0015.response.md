To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the loop head and how it affects the state.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not explicitly used in the state description. However, the loop head also involves the `input()` function, which reads from the `stdin` stream.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` is empty. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty, as the `input()` function needs to read another value.

The other variables in the state description (`k`, `x`, `a`, `s`, and `i`) are not directly affected by the loop head, so their values do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` times `s` divided by `k-1` plus `x`, `stdin` is not empty, `i` is `x-1`, and 'YES' is printed if `a` is greater than or equal to `s` otherwise 'NO' is printed**
