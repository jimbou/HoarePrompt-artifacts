Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 4 plus 2 times `s` divided by `k-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be 4 plus 2 times `s` divided by `k-1`, which is a more complex expression than its initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
