To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `x` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `x` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `x` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is greater than 1, `a` is an integer, `s` is 2 plus `s // (k - 1)`, `i` is 1, stdin is empty**
