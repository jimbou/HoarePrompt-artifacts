Output State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` + 1 if `k` is 1, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 2, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 3, `s` is `x` + 2 + (`x`-3)*`s`/(`k`-1) if `k` is 4 or more, `i` is `x`, stdin is empty.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the values of `k`, `a`, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `x` is still an integer, but its value is not constrained by the loop. The value of `s` depends on the value of `k` and `x`. If `k` is 1, `s` is `x` + 1. If `k` is 2, `s` is `x` + 2. If `k` is 3, `s` is also `x` + 2. If `k` is 4 or more, `s` is `x` + 2 plus the result of (`x`-3) times `s` divided by (`k`-1). The value of `i` is now equal to `x`, indicating that the loop has finished executing all its iterations.
