The code prints 'YES' if the value of `a` is greater than or equal to the value of `s`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The value of `s` is calculated as `x` times `s` divided by `k-1` plus `x`. Since the exact values of `k`, `x`, and `a` are not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output either 'YES' or 'NO' depending on the comparison between `a` and `s`.

Output: **YES if a is greater than or equal to s, otherwise NO**
