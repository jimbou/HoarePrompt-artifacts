To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is the loop variable `_`, which is not used in the loop body. The loop will execute as long as there are more inputs to read.

At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` is empty, which means there are no more inputs to read. For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must not be empty.

State: **`k` is an integer, `x` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `s` is `x` + 1 if `k` is 1, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 2, `s` is `x` + 2 if `k` is 3, `s` is `x` + 2 + (`x`-3)*`s`/(`k`-1) if `k` is 4 or more, `i` is `x`, stdin is not empty, and either 'YES' or 'NO' is printed depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `s` or not.**
