This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n and two strings a and b of length n containing '<' and '>' characters. It then checks each test case to determine if the strings satisfy a specific condition: for every pair of adjacent characters in the strings, if the characters are both '<', they must be in the same position in both strings. If this condition is met for all pairs of adjacent characters, the function prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function processes all test cases and prints a result for each one.
