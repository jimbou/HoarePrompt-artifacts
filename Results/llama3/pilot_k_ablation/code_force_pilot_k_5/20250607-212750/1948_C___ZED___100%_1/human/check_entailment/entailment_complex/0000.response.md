Reasoning: 

The given Python program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if the robot can reach the cell (2, n) based on the given grid and arrow directions.

The program iterates over each pair of adjacent characters in the strings a and b, starting from the second character (index 1) and stepping by 2. For each pair, it checks if both characters are '<' and if they are in the same position in both strings. If this condition is met for any pair, it prints 'NO' and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it prints 'YES'.

This logic is correct because if there is a pair of adjacent characters that are both '<' and in the same position in both strings, it means that the robot cannot move to the right from that position, and therefore cannot reach the cell (2, n). On the other hand, if no such pair is found, it means that the robot can always move to the right and eventually reach the cell (2, n).

Correctness: **True**
