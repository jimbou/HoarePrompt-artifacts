Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program iterates over each test case by reading the number of test cases `t` and then iterating over each test case using a `for` loop.
2.  For each test case, it reads the number of columns `n` and the two strings `a` and `b` representing the arrows in the grid.
3.  The program then checks if there is a pair of arrows pointing to the left (`'<'`) in the same column but in different rows, or if there is a pair of arrows pointing to the left in adjacent columns but in the same row. If such a pair is found, it prints `'NO'` and breaks out of the loop.
4.  If no such pair is found after checking all columns, it prints `'YES'`.

The logic behind this is that if there is a pair of arrows pointing to the left in the same column but in different rows, or if there is a pair of arrows pointing to the left in adjacent columns but in the same row, then the robot cannot reach the cell `(2, n)`. This is because the robot's movement is restricted by the arrows, and it cannot move to a cell that has an arrow pointing to the left.

The program correctly implements this logic and produces the correct output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
