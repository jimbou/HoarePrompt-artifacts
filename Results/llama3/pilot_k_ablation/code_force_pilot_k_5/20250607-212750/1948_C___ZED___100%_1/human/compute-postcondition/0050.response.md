Output State: **`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged, and 'NO' is still being printed. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
