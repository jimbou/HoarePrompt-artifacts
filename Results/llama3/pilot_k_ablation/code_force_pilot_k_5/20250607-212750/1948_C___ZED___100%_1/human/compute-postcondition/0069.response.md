Output State: **`j` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 3, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code executes a break statement, which means we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-6` test cases, and 'NO' is still being printed. The only change is that we break out of the innermost loop or if statement.
