Output State: **`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, otherwise `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-10` test cases, and 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged from their initial values. The value of `i` is determined by whether `n` is odd or even, and 'YES' is printed to indicate that the loop has completed all its iterations without encountering any conditions that would cause it to break out of the loop or print 'NO'.
