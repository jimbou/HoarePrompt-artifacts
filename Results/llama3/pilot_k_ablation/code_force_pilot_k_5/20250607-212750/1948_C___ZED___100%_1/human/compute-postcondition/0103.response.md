Output State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'NO' is being printed.**

The code only contains a `break` statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. The values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the program will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently in. Additionally, the output 'NO' is still being printed.
