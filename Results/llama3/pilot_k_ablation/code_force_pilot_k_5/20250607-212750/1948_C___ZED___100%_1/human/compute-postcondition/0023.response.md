The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 7, `n` is even and at least 8. So for the loop to be executed one more time the `i` is 9 and `n` is at least 10.
State: **`j` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9**
