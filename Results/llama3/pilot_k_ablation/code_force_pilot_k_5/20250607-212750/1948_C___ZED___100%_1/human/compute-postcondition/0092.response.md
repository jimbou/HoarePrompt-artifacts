Output: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-8` test cases. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', and 'NO' is printed**
