The code snippet is a simple break statement, which means it will exit the current loop or conditional statement it is inside.

Output State: **`j` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that we are now outside the loop or conditional statement that the break statement was inside. The values of all variables remain the same, and the string 'NO' is still being printed.
