Output State: **j is 1, t is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, n is even, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is n - 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

The code reads the value of `n` from stdin, which is even, and assigns it to the variable `n`. Then, it reads two strings `a` and `b` from stdin, each of length `n`, consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The value of `i` is set to `n - 1`. The value of `j` remains unchanged at 1. The value of `t` is decremented by 1, but it is still greater than 0. Stdin now contains `t-3` test cases.
