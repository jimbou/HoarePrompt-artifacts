Output State: **`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, stdin contains `t-10` test cases, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. The values of `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain the same. The stdin still contains `t-10` test cases, and 'NO' is still being printed.
