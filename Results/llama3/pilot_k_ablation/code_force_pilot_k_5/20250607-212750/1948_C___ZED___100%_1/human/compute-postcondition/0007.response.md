Postcondition: ***`j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1. If `i + 1` is less than `n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration.***
