Output State: **j is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Each test case consists of an integer n (2 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by two strings of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters. n is even, t is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters.**

The code reads an integer t from stdin, which is the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer n, which is the length of the two strings a and b. The strings a and b are then read from stdin. The variable j is not affected by the code and remains 0. The value of t is decremented by 1 after each test case. The strings a and b are assigned the values of the two strings read from stdin for each test case. The length of the strings a and b is n, which is even. The strings a and b consist of '<' and '>' characters.
