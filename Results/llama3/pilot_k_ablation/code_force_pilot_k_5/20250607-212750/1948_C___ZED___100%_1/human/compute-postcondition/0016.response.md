Output State: **`j` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 5, 'NO' is being printed, stdin contains `t-2` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin contains `t-2` test cases because one test case has been processed and another one is being processed. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement. 'NO' is still being printed as it was in the initial state.
