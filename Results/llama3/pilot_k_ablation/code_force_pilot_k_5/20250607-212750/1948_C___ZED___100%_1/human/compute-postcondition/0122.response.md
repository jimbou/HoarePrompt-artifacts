Output State: **`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-10` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-10` test cases. The condition that `i + 1` is less than `n` still holds. Additionally, the conditions that either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', and 'NO' is printed are still valid. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
