Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer at least 7, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without printing 'NO' or breaking out of the loop.***
