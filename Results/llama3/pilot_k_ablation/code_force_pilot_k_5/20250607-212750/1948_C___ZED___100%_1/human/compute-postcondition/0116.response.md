The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `t`. If `j` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 4.
State: **`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, otherwise `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-9` test cases**
