To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved in the loop head are `j` and the input value, which is stored in `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than the input value. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `t` is greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3. The input value `t` remains the same, but since `j` is now 3, the loop will only execute again if `t` is greater than 3.

The other variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `i`, and `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, otherwise `i` is `n`, `stdin` contains `t-7` test cases**
