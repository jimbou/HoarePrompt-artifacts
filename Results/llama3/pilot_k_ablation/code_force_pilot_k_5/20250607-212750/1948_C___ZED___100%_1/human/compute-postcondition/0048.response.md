Based on the precondition, the code will print the string 'NO' exactly `t-3` times, where `t` is greater than 2.

Here's the explanation:

* The initial state mentions that `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. This implies that the code is part of a loop that runs `t-3` times.
* The code snippet only contains a single `print` statement, which prints the string 'NO'.
* Since the loop runs `t-3` times, the `print` statement will be executed `t-3` times, printing 'NO' each time.

Output: **NO (printed t-3 times)**
