To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 and `i` is within the range `[1, n)` with a step of 2.

Since `n` is already at least 3, we don't need to adjust its state. However, we need to ensure that `i` is within the correct range. Since `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, and `n` if `n` is even, we can conclude that `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-1`.

To make the loop execute, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range `[1, n)` with a step of 2. Therefore, we can set `i` to 1, which is the smallest possible value that satisfies the loop condition.

State: **`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-10` test cases**
