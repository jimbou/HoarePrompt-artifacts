Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. The current value of `i` is less than `n-1`, and either the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i+1` in `b` are both '<', or the current character at index `i` in `a` and the character at index `i-1` in `b` are both '<'.***
