The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is even and at least 6. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 2 so `i` is 7 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 7.
State: **`j` is 0, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 8, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7.**
