Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
