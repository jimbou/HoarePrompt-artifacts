Output State: **j is 4, t is greater than 4, n is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is n-1 if n is odd, otherwise i is n, stdin contains t-10 test cases**

In this output state, the values of `j` and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `n` is updated to the input value, which is at least 3. The strings `a` and `b` are updated to have a length of `n` and consist of '<' and '>' characters. The value of `i` is updated based on whether `n` is odd or even. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 3, from `t-9` to `t-10`, as three inputs are read from stdin.
