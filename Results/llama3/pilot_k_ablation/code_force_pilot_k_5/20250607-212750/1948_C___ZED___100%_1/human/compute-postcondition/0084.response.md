Output State: **`j` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, stdin contains `t-7` test cases, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, from `t-6` to `t-7`. The rest of the conditions and values remain the same.
