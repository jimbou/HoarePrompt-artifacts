Output State: **`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or conditional block.
