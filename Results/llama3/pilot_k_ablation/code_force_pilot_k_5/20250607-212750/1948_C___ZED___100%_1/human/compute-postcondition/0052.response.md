To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n` and `i` is incremented by 2 (since the step size is 2). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 7 and `n` is even and at least 5.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 2, so `i` becomes 9. Since `n` is even and at least 5, it must be greater than 9 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**
