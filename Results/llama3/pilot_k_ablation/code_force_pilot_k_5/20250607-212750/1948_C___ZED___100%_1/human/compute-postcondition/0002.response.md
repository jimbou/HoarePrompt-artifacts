To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2). Before the loop starts, `j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, but these do not directly affect the loop's execution. However, since `n` is even and at least 2, and the loop starts from 1 and increments by 2, we can infer that `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1**
