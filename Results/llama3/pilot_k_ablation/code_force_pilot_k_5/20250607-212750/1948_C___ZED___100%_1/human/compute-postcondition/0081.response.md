The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 7, `n` is at least 7. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 2 so `i` is 9 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 9.
State: **`j` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, stdin contains `t-6` test cases.**
