Output State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is odd, otherwise `i` is `n`, stdin contains `t-8` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has checked all the required conditions for the given input strings `a` and `b` of length `n`. If at any point during the loop execution, the condition `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` is met, the loop breaks and 'NO' is printed. If the loop completes all iterations without meeting this condition, it prints 'YES'. The values of `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, and `i` is updated to `n-1` if `n` is odd, otherwise it is `n`. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 8.
