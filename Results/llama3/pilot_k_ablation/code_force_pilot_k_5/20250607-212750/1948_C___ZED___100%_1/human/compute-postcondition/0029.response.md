The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. If `j` is less than `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `int(input())` is `t` which is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1. So for the loop to execute again `j` is 1 and `int(input())` is `t` which is greater than 1 and is decremented by 1.
State: **`j` is 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, t is greater than 1 and is decremented by 1, n is even, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is n - 1**
