Postcondition: ***`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
