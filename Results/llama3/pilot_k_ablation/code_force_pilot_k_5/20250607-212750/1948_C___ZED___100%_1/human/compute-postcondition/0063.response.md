Output: **`j` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-6` test cases. The current value of `i` is less than `n-1` and either the current character in `a` at index `i` and the next character in `b` at index `i+1` are both '<', or the current character in `a` at index `i` and the previous character in `b` at index `i-1` are both '<', and 'NO' is printed**
