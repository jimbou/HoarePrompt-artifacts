Output State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 7, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7, and 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values since the `break` statement only terminates the execution of the innermost loop or if statement and does not modify any variables. The program will exit the current loop or if statement and continue executing the code that follows.
