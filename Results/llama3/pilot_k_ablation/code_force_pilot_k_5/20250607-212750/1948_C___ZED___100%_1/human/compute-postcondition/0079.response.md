Output State: **`j` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and at least 7, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. This means that the values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The program still has `t-6` test cases in the standard input (stdin), and 'NO' is still being printed. The only change is that the program breaks out of the innermost loop or conditional statement it was inside.
