Output State: **`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` do not change. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. 'NO' is still being printed. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
