Output State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-8` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1, and the condition `i + 1` is less than `n` still holds. The stdin still contains `t-8` test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement.
