Output State: **`j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 3, 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Explanation: The `break` statement only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, it does not affect the values of the variables. Therefore, the values of `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain the same. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `stdin` still contains `t-2` test cases because the `break` statement does not consume any input.
