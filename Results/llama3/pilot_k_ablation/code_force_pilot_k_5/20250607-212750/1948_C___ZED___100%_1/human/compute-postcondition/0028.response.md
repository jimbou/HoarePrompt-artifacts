Output State: **j is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases, t is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, n is even, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is n - 1. If i + 1 is not less than n and either a[i] and b[i + 1] are both '<' or a[i] and b[i - 1] are both '<', then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `i` has reached `n - 1`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. If the conditions in the loop body are not met, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed.
