The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `t`. If `j` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `t` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 1.
State: **`j` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains `t-4` test cases**
