Output State: **j is 2, t is greater than 1, n is an integer, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is not defined, stdin contains t-6 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `j` remains unchanged as 2. The value of `t` is still greater than 1, but its exact value is not specified. The value of `n` is now an integer, but its parity (even or odd) is not guaranteed. The strings `a` and `b` have lengths equal to the new value of `n` and consist of '<' and '>' characters. The variable `i` is no longer defined, as its initial value was overwritten by the new value of `n`. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 2, from `t-4` to `t-6`.
