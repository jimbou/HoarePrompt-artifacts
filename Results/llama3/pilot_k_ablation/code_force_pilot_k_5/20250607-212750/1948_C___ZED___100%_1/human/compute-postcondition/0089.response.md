To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and increments by 2). Additionally, the initial value of `i` should be 1, as specified in the loop head.


State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-8` test cases**
