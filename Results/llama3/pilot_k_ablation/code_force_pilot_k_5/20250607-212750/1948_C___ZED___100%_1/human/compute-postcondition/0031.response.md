To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and increments by 2). Additionally, `i` should be initialized to 1, as specified in the loop head.

State: **`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-3` test cases**
