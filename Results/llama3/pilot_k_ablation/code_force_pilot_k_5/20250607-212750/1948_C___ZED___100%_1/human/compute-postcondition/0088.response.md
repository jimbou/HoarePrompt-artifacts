Output State: **j is 3, t is greater than 3, n is an integer equal to the input value, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is n-1 if n is odd, otherwise i is n, stdin contains t-8 test cases**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters to `a`. The third line assigns a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters to `b`. 

The value of `j` remains unchanged at 3. The value of `t` is still greater than 3. The value of `n` is updated to the input value. The values of `a` and `b` are updated to strings of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters. The value of `i` is updated based on the parity of `n`. If `n` is odd, `i` becomes `n-1`; otherwise, `i` becomes `n`. The number of test cases in `stdin` decreases by 3, from `t-7` to `t-8`.
