Postcondition: ***`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
