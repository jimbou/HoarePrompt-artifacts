Output State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 7, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition that 'NO' is being printed is still valid.
