Postcondition: ***`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 6, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 5. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and 'NO' is being printed. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
