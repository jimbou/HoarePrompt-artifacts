Output State: **`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 0, `n` is even, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is `n-1`, stdin contains `t-3` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` for any `i` in the range `[1, n, 2)`, then 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the values of `j`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and the contents of `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is now `n-1`, indicating that the loop has iterated over all the odd indices of `a` and `b`. If at any point during the loop's execution, the condition `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'` was true for any `i` in the range `[1, n, 2)`, then the program printed 'NO' and broke out of the loop. Otherwise, the program printed 'YES'.
