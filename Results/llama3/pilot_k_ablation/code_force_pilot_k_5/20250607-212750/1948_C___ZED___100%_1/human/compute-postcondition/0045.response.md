Output State: **`j` is 1, `t` is greater than 2, `n` is even and at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases. The 'NO' is still being printed. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
