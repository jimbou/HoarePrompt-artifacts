Output State: **`j` is 2, `t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-6` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 1. The stdin still contains `t-6` test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the program will exit the current loop or if statement and continue executing the next part of the code.
