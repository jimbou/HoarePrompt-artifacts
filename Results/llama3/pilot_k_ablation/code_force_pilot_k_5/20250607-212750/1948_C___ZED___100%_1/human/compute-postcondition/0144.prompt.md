Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: j is 4, t is greater than 4, n is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, a is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, b is a string of length n consisting of '<' and '>' characters, i is n-1 if n is odd, otherwise i is n, stdin contains t-10 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n, 2):
    if i + 1 < n and a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<' or a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<':
        print('NO')
        break
else:
    print('YES')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<' or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 3, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer at least 7, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without printing 'NO' or breaking out of the loop.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer at least 10, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 9, stdin contains `t-10` test cases. If `i + 1 < n` and `a[i] == b[i + 1] == '<'` or `a[i] == b[i - 1] == '<'`, then 'NO' is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
