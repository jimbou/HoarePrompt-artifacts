Output State: **`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 3, stdin contains `t-10` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-10` test cases. However, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The 'NO' that was being printed is still being printed.
