Output State: **`j` is 4, `t` is greater than 4, `n` is an integer at least 5, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t-10` test cases, 'NO' is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `j`, `t`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The standard input still contains `t-10` test cases, and 'NO' is still being printed.
