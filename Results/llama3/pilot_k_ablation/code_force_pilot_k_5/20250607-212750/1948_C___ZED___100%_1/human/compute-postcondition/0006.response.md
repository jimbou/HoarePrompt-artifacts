Output State: **`j` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases, `t` is greater than 0 and is decremented by 1, `n` is even and at least 3, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `i + 1` is less than `n`, and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<'. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `j`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `t` is decremented by 1, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1. The condition that `i + 1` is less than `n` and either `a[i]` and `b[i + 1]` are both '<', or `a[i]` and `b[i - 1]` are both '<' still holds. Additionally, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
