The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 2 (since the step size is 2), so `i` is 7 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 7.
State: **`j` is 3, `t` is greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the input value and at least 7, `a` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `b` is a string of length `n` consisting of '<' and '>' characters, `i` is 7**
