Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given sequence of integers. The program first reads the input, then creates a set of unique integers from the input sequence. It then checks if the sequence is consecutive by iterating through the sorted set. If the sequence is not consecutive, it alternates between 'Alice' and 'Bob' as the winner. If the sequence is consecutive, the winner is 'Alice'. The program prints the winner for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge case where the sequence has only one unique integer (i.e., all integers are the same), in which case 'Alice' is the winner.

The program also correctly handles the case where the sequence is not consecutive, in which case the winner alternates between 'Alice' and 'Bob'.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the given sequence of integers.

Correctness: **True**
