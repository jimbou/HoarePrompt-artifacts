Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the winner of the game based on the sequence of integers. The program first reads the input and stores it in a list. It then creates a set from the list to remove duplicates and sorts the set. The program then checks if the sequence is consecutive by iterating through the set and checking if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is greater than 1. If the sequence is not consecutive, the program alternates between 'Alice' and 'Bob' as the winner. If the sequence is consecutive, the winner is 'Alice'. The program prints the winner for each test case.

The program correctly handles the edge case where the sequence has only one element, in which case 'Alice' is the winner. The program also correctly handles the case where the sequence is consecutive, in which case 'Alice' is the winner.

The execution summary provided is accurate and matches the behavior of the program.

Correctness: **True**
