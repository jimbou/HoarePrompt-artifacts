To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `stdin`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of test cases left in `stdin`. If there are more test cases, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` (one more than the number of integers in `arr`), `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.

For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more test case in `stdin`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `stdin` to contain `t-4` test cases.

Additionally, since `_` is the loop variable, it will be incremented by 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `_` to 2.

The other variables (`t`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `arr`, and `s`) are not involved in the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 1, `n` is the length of `s` (one more than the number of integers in `arr`), `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If `n` is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If `n` is at least 3, if `ans` is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and 'Bob' is being printed.**
