Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `ans` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The condition `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1 is still valid.
