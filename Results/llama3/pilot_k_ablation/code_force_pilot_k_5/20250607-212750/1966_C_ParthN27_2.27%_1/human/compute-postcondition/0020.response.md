Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is still greater than 1.
