To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `n` is already at least 4, it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 4, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**
