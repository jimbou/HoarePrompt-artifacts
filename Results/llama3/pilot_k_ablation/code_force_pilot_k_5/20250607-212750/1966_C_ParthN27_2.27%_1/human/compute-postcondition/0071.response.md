Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is less than or equal to 1**

The value of `ans` is changed to 0, which is the result of 1 - `ans` where `ans` was initially 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
