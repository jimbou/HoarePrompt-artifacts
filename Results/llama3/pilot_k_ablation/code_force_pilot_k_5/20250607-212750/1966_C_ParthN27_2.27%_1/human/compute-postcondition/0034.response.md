Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 4, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `ans` is 0 if it was 1 before, and 1 if it was 0 before.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been flipped, i.e., it is now the opposite of its previous value. All other variables remain unchanged.
