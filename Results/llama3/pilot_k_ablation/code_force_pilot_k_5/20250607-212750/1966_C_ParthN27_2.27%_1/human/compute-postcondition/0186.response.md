Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 5 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `n` is at least 6, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

The value of `ans` is toggled from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition regarding the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is still applicable, and if it is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
