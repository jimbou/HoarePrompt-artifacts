Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `ans` is 1, stdin contains `t-4` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still a positive integer, the value of `_` is still 2, the value of `i` is still 4, the value of `n` is still at least 5 and not equal to 2, the value of `arr` is still a list of integers, the value of `s` is still a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, the value of `ans` is 1, the stdin contains `t-4` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
