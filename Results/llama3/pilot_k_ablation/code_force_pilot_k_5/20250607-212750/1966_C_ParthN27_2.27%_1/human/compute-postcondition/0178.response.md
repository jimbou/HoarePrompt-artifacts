Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `n` is at least `i+2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

The code `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` to the opposite of its current value. Since `ans` was initially either 0 or 1, it will now be either 1 or 0, respectively. The other variables remain unchanged.
