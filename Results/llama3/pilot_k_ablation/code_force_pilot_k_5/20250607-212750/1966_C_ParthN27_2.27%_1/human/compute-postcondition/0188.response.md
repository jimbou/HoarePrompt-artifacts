Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `i` will be `n-1`, which is the last index of the list `s`. The value of `ans` will be either 0 or 1, depending on whether the difference between consecutive elements in `s` was ever greater than 1. The other variables, `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
