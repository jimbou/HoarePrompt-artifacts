Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t-2` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of test cases in stdin decreases by 1, from `t-1` to `t-2`.
