Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`, `i` is 2, `ans` is not defined, stdin contains `t-3` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the third element of `arr`, in addition to the first two elements it already contained. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
