The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first three elements of `arr`, `i` is 3, `ans` is not defined, stdin contains `t-3` test cases**
