Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 4, `ans` is 1**

The code `ans = 1 - ans` changes the value of `ans` to `1 - ans`. Since `ans` was initially 0, the new value of `ans` is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
