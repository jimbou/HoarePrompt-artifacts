Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain the same. The value of `ans` is toggled to the opposite value, meaning if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in `stdin` depends on the condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`. If this condition is true, then `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, otherwise, it contains `t-5` test cases.
