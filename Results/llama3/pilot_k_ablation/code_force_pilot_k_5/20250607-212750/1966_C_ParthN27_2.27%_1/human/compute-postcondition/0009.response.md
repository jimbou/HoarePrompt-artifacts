The code adds the element at index `i` of `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 3, the element at index 3 of `arr` is added to `s`. The size of `s` increases by 1, so it now contains four integers from `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that is greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing four integers from `arr`, `i` is 3, stdin contains t-1 test cases**
