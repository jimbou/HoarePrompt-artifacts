Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ans` is either 0 or 1, and its value is toggled to the opposite value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is flipped to its opposite value, i.e., if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
