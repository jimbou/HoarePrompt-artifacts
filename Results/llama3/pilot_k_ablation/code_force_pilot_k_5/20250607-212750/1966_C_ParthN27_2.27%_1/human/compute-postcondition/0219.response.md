Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is less than or equal to 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 0, which is the result of the expression `1 - ans`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `_`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `stdin` are still valid.
