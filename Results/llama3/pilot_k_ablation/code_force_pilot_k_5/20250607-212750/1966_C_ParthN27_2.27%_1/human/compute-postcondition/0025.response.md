Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is 1, indicating that the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The `stdin` still contains `t-1` test cases, as the `break` statement does not affect the input.
