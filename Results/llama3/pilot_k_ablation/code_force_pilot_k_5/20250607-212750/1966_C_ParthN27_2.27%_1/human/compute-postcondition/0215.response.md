The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n-1`, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 3.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**
