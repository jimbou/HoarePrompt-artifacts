The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional statement that it is directly inside.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `ans` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
