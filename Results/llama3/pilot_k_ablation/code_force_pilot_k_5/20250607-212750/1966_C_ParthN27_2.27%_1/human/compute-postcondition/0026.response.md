Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `ans` is 0 if the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated based on its previous value. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is now 0, otherwise it is 1. The other variables remain unchanged.
