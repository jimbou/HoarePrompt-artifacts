Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is 2, n is at least 3, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers containing all elements of arr plus 0 at the beginning, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and n is not equal to 2. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in s is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and ans is 1. Otherwise, ans is 0 and the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in s is less than or equal to 1.***
