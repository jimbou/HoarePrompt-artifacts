Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1, `n` must be greater than 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing three integers from `arr` at index 0, 1 and 2, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the integer at index 2 of `arr`, in addition to the integers at index 0 and 1 that it already contained. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
