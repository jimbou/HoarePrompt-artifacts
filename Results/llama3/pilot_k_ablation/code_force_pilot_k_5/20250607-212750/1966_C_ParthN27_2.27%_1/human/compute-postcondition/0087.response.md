Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 5, `ans` is 0**

The value of `ans` is updated to 1 - `ans`, where `ans` was initially 1. Therefore, `ans` is now 0. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
