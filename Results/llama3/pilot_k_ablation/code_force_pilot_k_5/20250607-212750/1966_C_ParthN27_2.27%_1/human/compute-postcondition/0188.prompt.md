Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer, _ is 1, i is n, ans is 1, n is the length of s (one more than the number of integers in arr), arr is a list of integers, s is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from arr, stdin contains t-3 test cases, n is larger than 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans = 1 - ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least `i+2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 3 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least `i+2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 6, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 5 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 6, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
