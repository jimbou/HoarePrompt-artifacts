The only object in the loop head is variable _. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable _. If _ is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, _ is 1, t is a positive integer and at least 3 test cases are left. So for the loop to be executed one more time the _ is 2 and t is a positive integer and at least 2 test cases are left.
State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 2, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers with a prepended 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases, i is n-1, ans is 1. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, if n is even, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**
