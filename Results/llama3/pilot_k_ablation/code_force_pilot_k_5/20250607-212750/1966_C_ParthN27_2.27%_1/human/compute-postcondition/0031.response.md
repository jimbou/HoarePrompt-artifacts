Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 1.***
