Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 5 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
