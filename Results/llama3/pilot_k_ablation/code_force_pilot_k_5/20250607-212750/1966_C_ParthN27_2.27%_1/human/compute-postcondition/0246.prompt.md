Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains t test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains an integer n. The second line contains n space-separated integers. t is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, and the integers are positive integers.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set()
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr[i])
    s = list(s)
    ans = 1
    s = [0] + s
    n = len(s)
    if n == 2:
        print('Alice')
    else:
        for i in range(1, n - 1):
            if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
                break
            else:
                ans = 1 - ans
        if ans:
            print('Alice')
        else:
            print('Bob')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is the length of the list s plus one, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from arr, i is n-1, ans is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, depending on whether the number of iterations of the loop is even or odd, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers with a prepended 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is n-1, ans is 1. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, if n is even, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is n, ans is 1, n is the length of the list s plus one, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers containing all elements of arr plus 0 at the beginning, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3 and not equal to 2, the program iterates through the list s. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in s is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, ans is toggled to the opposite of its previous value. If ans is True, 'Alice' is printed; otherwise, 'Bob' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 1, i is n, ans is 1, n is the length of s (one more than the number of integers in arr), arr is a list of integers, s is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from arr, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If n is at least 3, if ans is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, ans is 0 and 'Bob' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is n-1, ans is 1, n is the number of elements in arr plus 1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of arr, stdin contains t-5 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. Otherwise, if ans is 1, 'Alice' is printed; otherwise, 'Bob' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
