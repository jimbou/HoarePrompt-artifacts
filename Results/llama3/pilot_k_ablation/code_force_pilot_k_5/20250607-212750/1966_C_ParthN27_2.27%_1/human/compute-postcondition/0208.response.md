The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. The value of `i` is 4, so the element at index 4 of `arr` is added to `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains t-5 test cases.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `ans` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first five elements of `arr`, stdin contains t-5 test cases**
