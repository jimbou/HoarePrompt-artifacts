Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin now contains `t-6` test cases instead of `t-5` because one test case has been processed before the break statement.
