Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `i` is 1, `ans` is not defined, stdin contains `t-3` test cases**

The code adds the second element of `arr` to the set `s`, which initially contained only the first element of `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
