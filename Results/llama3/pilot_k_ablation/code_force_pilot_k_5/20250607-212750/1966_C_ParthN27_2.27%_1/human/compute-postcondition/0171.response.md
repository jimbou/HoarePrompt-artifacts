Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the difference between the `i-th` element and the `(i-1)-th` element of `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is set to 0.***
