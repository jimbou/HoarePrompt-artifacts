Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 5. If the difference between the current and previous elements in `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the value of `ans` is unknown.***
