Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is less than or equal to 1 and `ans` is 0.***
