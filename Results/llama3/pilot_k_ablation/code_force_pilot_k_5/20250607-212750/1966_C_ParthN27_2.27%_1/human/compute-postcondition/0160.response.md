Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is `n`, `ans` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all integers from `arr`, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `_`, `ans`, and `n` as in the initial state. The variable `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The set `s` will contain all integers from the list `arr`, since the loop adds each integer from `arr` to `s` in each iteration. The stdin will still contain t-3 test cases, as it is not affected by the loop.
