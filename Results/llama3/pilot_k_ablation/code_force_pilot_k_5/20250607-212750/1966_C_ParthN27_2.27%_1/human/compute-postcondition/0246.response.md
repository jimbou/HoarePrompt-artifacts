Output State: **t is 0, _ is t, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers with a prepended 0, stdin contains 0 test cases, i is n-1, ans is 1.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases (t) is 0, the loop counter (_) is equal to the initial number of test cases (t), the number of elements in the array (n) is an integer, the array (arr) is a list of integers, the set (s) is a list of integers with a prepended 0, the standard input (stdin) contains 0 test cases, the loop counter (i) is equal to n-1, and the answer (ans) is 1.
