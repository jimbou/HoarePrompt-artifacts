Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, `ans` is the opposite of its previous value (1 if it was 0, 0 if it was 1).**

In this output state, all variables except `ans` retain their initial values. The value of `ans` is flipped, so if it was 0 initially, it becomes 1, and if it was 1 initially, it becomes 0.
