Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 3, if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `ans` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` is toggled, i.e., if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is now the opposite of its previous value.
