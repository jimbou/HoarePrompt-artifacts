Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is n, ans is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is a set containing all elements of arr, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, and the set `s` will contain all elements of the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged.
