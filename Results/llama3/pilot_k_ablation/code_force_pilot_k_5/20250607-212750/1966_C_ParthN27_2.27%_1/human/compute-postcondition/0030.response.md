Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `ans` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1, which is the result of the expression `1 - ans`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `ans` was initially 0, so the expression `1 - ans` evaluates to 1.
