Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least `i+2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains `t-3` test cases.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
