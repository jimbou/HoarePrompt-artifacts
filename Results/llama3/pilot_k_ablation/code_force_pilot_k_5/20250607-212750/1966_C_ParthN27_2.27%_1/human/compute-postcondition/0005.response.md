Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer that is greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing two integers from `arr`, `i` is 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the integer at index `i` (which is 1) from the list `arr`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-1 test cases.
