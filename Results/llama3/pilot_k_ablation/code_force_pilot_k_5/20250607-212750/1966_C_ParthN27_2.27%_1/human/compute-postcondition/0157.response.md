Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is 3, `ans` is 1, `n` must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing four integers from `arr` at index 0, 1, 2 and 3, stdin contains t-4 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the integer at index 3 of `arr`, in addition to the integers at index 0, 1, and 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
