Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing two integers from `arr` at index 0 and 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the integer at index 1 of `arr`, in addition to the integer at index 0 that was already in the set. The other variables remain unchanged.
