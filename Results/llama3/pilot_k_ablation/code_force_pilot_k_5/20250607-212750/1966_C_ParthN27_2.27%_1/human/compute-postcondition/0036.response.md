The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 5.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 5**
