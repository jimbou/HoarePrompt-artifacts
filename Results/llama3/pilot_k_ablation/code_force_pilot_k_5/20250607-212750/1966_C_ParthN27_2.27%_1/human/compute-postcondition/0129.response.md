Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0. ***
