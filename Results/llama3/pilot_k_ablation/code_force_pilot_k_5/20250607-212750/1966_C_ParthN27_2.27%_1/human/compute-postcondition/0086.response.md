Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 5, `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The initial state remains the same except that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
