The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 1 and at most `n-2`, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be greater than `i+1`. 
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least `i+2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**
