To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. Since `n` is at least 3, `n-1` is at least 2, which is greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

The other variables, such as `t`, `_`, `arr`, `s`, `stdin`, `ans`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0**
