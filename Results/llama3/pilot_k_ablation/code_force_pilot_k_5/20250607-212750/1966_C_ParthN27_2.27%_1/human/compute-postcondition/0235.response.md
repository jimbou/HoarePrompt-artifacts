Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is toggled to the opposite value, meaning if it was 0, it becomes 1, and if it was 1, it becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in `stdin` is still `t-6`.
