Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to 1, which is calculated by subtracting the initial value of `ans` (0) from 1. The other variables remain unchanged, maintaining their initial values and properties.
