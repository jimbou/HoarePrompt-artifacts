Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is n-1, ans is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3, if n is even, 'Alice' is printed, otherwise 'Bob' is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `_` also remains the same, which is 2. The value of `i` is updated to `n-1` because the initial value of `i` was `n-1` and `n` has been updated. The value of `ans` remains the same, which is 1. The value of `n` is updated to an integer value read from the input. The value of `arr` is updated to a list of integers read from the input. The value of `s` is updated to an empty set. The number of test cases in stdin is reduced by 2, so it now contains `t-3` test cases. The printing of 'Alice' or 'Bob' depends on the value of `n`.
