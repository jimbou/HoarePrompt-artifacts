Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases and `ans` is either 0 or 1.***
