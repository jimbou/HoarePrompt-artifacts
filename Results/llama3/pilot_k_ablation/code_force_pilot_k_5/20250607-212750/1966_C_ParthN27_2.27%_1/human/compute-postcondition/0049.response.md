To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` and `stdin`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more test cases in `stdin`. At the end of the previous iteration, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases.

For the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one more test case. Therefore, we can adjust the state of `stdin` to contain `t-2` test cases.

The variable `_` is not used in the loop body, so its state does not affect the execution of the loop.

The other variables `t`, `n`, `arr`, `s`, `i`, and `ans` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is the length of the list `s` plus one, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-2` test cases**
