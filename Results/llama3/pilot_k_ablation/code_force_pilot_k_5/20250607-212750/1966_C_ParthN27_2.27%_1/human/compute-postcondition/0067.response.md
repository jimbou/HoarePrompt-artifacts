To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 3 (since the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`). 

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**
