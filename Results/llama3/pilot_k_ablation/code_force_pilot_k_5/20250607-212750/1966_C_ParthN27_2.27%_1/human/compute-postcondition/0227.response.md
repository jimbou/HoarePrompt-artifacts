Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases and `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been toggled to the opposite value, meaning if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
