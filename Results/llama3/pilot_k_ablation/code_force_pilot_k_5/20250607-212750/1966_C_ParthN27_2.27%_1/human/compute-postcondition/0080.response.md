Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `i` is 3. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.***
