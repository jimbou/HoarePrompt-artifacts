Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 6, `n` is at least 7 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the `break` statement. The `break` statement only causes the program to exit the most internal loop or if statement it is directly inside, without modifying any variable values. The `stdin` still contains `t-6` test cases as no input was read or modified.
