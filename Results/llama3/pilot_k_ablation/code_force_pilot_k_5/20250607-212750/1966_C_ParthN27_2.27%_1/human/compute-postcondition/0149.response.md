Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, i is n, ans is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**

Explanation:

*   The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `t` is a positive integer and stdin contains `t-2` test cases, after reading one integer, stdin will contain `t-3` test cases.
*   The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. This does not affect any other variables.
*   The third line initializes an empty set `s`. This does not affect any other variables.

Note that the initial state of `n` being the length of the list `s` plus one is overwritten by the first line of the code, which assigns a new value to `n` from the input.
