Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 1, i is n, ans is 1, n is the length of s (one more than the number of integers in arr), arr is a list of integers, s is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from arr, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is being printed. If n is at least 3, if ans is 1, 'Alice' is being printed. Otherwise, ans is 0 and 'Bob' is being printed.***
