According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is `n`, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0. Also, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is 0, ans is 1, n is an integer that must be at least 1, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, stdin contains t-5 test cases**
