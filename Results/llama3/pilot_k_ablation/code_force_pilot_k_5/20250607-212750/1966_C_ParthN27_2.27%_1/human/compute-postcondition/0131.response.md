The code snippet is a simple break statement, which means it will exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside.

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
