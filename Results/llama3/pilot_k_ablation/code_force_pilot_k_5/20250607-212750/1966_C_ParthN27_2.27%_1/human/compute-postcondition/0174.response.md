Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 1 or 0, `n` is at least `i+2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been flipped. If `ans` was 0, it is now 1, and if `ans` was 1, it is now 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
