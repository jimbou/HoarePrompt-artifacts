Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 4 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least 6, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `t`, `_`, `i`, `ans`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the program will exit the current loop or conditional statement and continue executing the code outside of it. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
