Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is n-1, ans is 1, n is the number of elements in arr plus 1, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of arr, stdin contains t-5 test cases, and n is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans = 1 - ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases and `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases and `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases and `ans` is either 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `ans` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. Otherwise, `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
