Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `n`, `arr`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is either 0 or 1, and its value is not changed by the code. The code only breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1, from `t-5` to `t-6`.
