The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, stdin contains t-5 test cases**
