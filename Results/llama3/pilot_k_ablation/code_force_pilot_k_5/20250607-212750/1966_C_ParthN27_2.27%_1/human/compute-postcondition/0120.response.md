Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, stdin contains `t-3` test cases, and `n` is not equal to 2. The difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still a positive integer, `_` is still 2, `i` is still 2, `ans` has been flipped from 1 to 0, `n` is still at least 3, `arr` remains the same list of integers, `s` remains the same list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, there are still `t-3` test cases in stdin, and `n` is still not equal to 2. Additionally, the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is still less than or equal to 1.
