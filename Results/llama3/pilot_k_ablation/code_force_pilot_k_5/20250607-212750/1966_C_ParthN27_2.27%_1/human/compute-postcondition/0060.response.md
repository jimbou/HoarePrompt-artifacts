Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first five elements of `arr`, `i` is 4, `ans` is not defined, stdin contains `t-4` test cases**

The code adds the fifth element of `arr` to the set `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-4` test cases.
