Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, `i` is 2, `ans` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. This means that the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement that we broke out of.
