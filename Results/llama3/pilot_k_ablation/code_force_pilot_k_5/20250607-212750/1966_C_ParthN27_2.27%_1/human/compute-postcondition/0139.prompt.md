Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: *t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is n, ans is 1, n is the length of the list s plus one, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers containing all elements of arr plus 0 at the beginning, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and n is not equal to 2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, n - 1):
    if s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1:
        break
    else:
        ans = 1 - ans


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is 2, n is at least 3, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers containing all elements of arr plus 0 at the beginning, stdin contains t-3 test cases, and n is not equal to 2. If the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in s is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and ans is 1. Otherwise, ans is 0 and the difference between the element at index i and the element at index i-1 in s is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and `n` is not equal to 2. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `ans` is 1. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is less than or equal to 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, then `ans` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled to the opposite of its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 6, `n` is at least 7 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled to the opposite of its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
