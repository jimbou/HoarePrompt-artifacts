The code adds the element at index `i` of the list `arr` to the set `s`. Since `i` is 0, the first element of the list `arr` is added to the set `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first element of `arr`, `i` is 0, `ans` is not defined, stdin contains `t-3` test cases**
