Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is n-1, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the set `s` will contain all unique integers from the list `arr`, and the loop counter `i` will be one less than the total number of elements in `arr` (since indexing starts at 0). The other variables remain unchanged.
