Postcondition: ***t is a positive integer, _ is 2, i is n, ans is 1, n is the length of the list s plus one, arr is a list of integers, s is a list of integers containing all elements of arr plus 0 at the beginning, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If n is 2, 'Alice' is printed. If n is at least 3 and not equal to 2, the program iterates through the list s. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in s is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, ans is toggled to the opposite of its previous value. If ans is True, 'Alice' is printed; otherwise, 'Bob' is printed.***
