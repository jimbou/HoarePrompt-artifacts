Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and we exit the innermost loop or if statement. The condition `s[i] - s[i - 1]` being greater than 1 is still valid, but it does not affect the values of the variables.
