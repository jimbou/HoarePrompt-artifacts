The code `ans = 1 - ans` is executed. However, the initial state does not mention the variable `ans`. Therefore, we cannot determine the new value of `ans`.


Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 5, `ans` is unknown**
