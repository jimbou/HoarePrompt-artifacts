Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 4. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, stdin contains `t-1` test cases and `ans` is toggled (0 becomes 1 and 1 becomes 0).***
