Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If the difference between the current element and the previous element in `s` is greater than 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `ans` is toggled to the opposite of its previous value.***
