Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases, `n` is not equal to 2, and `ans` is 0 if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, otherwise `ans` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` is flipped from its original value. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i-1` in `s` is greater than 1, `ans` is now 0, otherwise it is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
