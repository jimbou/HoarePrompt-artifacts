Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 0, n is a positive integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, stdin contains t-1 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The variable `_` still holds the value 0. The variable `n` now holds a positive integer value, which was read from the input. The variable `arr` is a list of integers, which were also read from the input. The variable `s` is an empty set. The stdin now contains `t-1` test cases, as one test case has been processed by the code.
