According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 3, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is the length of the list `s` plus one, `i` is `n-1`, and `n` is not equal to 2. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 3, and `i` is 1.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases**
