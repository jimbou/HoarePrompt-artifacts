The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `i` is 3, `ans` is 0. Otherwise, `i` is 3 and `ans` is 1.**
