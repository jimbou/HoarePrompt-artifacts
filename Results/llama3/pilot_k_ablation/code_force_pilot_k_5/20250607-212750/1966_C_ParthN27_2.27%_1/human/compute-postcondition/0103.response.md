Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a set containing the first two elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to include the second element of `arr`, in addition to the first element that was already in the set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-3` test cases.
