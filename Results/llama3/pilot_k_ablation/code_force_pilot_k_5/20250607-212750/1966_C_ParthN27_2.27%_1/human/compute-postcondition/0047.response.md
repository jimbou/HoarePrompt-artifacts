Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 0, `n` is the length of the list `s` plus one, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all integers from `arr`, `i` is `n-1`, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases. Depending on whether the number of iterations of the loop is even or odd, either 'Alice' or 'Bob' is printed.***
