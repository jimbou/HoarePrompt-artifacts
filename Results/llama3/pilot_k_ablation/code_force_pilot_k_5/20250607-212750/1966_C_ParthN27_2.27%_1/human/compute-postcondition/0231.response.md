Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 4, `n` is at least 5, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`. If `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, then `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases and `ans` is either 1 or 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases and `ans` is either 0 or 1.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been toggled to the opposite value, i.e., if it was 0, it is now 1, and if it was 1, it is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1` still determines whether we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and the number of test cases in `stdin`.
