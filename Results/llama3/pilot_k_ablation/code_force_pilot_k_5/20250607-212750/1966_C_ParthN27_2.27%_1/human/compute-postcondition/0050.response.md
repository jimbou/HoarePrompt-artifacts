Output State: **t is a positive integer, _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, s is an empty set, i is not defined, ans is not defined, stdin contains t-3 test cases**

The code snippet reads an integer `n` from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`, overwriting its previous value. It then reads a list of integers from the input and assigns it to the variable `arr`, replacing its previous value. The variable `s` is reassigned to an empty set. The variables `i` and `ans` are not defined in the given code snippet, so their previous values are lost. The variable `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains `t-3` test cases.
