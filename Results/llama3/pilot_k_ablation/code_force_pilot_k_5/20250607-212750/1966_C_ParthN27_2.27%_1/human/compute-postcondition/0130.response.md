To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4 and `n` is at least 5 and not equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 5. Since `n` is at least 5, it must be greater than 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 5, `n` is at least 6 and not equal to 2, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers containing all elements of `arr` plus 0 at the beginning, `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases.**
