Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `n` is an integer and must be at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers with a prepended 0, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` is greater than 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The current value of `s[i] - s[i - 1]` remains greater than 1.
