The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `n` must be at least 4.
State: **`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 2, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 4, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list of integers starting with 0 and containing all elements of `arr`, `stdin` contains `t-6` test cases if `s[i] - s[i - 1] > 1`, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases and `ans` is either 0 or 1 and its value is toggled to the opposite value**
