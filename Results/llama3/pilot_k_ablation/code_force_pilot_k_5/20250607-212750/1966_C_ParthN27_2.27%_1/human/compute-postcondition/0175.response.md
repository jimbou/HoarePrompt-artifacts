Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer, `_` is 1, `i` is at least 2 and at most `n-1`, `ans` is either 0 or 1, `n` is at least `i+2`, `arr` is a list of integers, `s` is a list containing 0 followed by all the integers from `arr`, and `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the difference between `s[i]` and `s[i-1]` is greater than 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
