This function determines the winner of a game based on a sequence of integers. It reads input from stdin, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n space-separated integers. The function then checks if the sequence is consecutive, and if not, it alternates between 'Alice' and 'Bob' as the winner. If the sequence is consecutive, the winner is 'Alice'. The function prints the winner for each test case.
