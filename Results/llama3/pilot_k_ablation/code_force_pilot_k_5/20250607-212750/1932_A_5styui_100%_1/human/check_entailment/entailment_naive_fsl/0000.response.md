Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to collect the maximum number of coins. The issue lies in the fact that it simply counts the number of '@' characters in the string, without considering the movement restrictions imposed by the '*' characters.

For example, consider the input:

    5
    .*@.*.

The program will output 2, but the correct output should be 1, because the '*' character blocks the path to the second '@' character.

The program does not take into account the fact that you can move one or two cells along the path, and that you cannot move to a cell with a '*' character. It simply counts the number of '@' characters, without considering the actual movement possibilities.

To correctly solve this problem, you would need to implement a dynamic programming approach that takes into account the movement restrictions and the fact that you can move one or two cells at a time.
