Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, `s` is increased by 1, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been increased by 1. The values of `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
