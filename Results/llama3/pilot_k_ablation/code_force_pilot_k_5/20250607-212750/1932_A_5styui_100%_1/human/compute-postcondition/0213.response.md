Output State: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, `s` is 1, and `stdin` is empty, and the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is still being printed.
