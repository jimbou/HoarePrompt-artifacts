Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 1 or 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 or if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is now 2. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is now 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
