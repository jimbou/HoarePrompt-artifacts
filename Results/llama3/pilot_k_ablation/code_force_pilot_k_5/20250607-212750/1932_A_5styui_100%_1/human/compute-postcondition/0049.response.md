Output State: **a is at least 1, i is 0, s is the total number of '@' in string b, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, j is equal to the length of string b.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of 'a' remains at least 1, 'i' remains 0, 's' is equal to the total number of '@' in string 'b', 'd' remains an integer between 1 and 50, and 'b' remains a string of 'd' characters with the specified properties. The value of 'j' is equal to the length of string 'b', indicating that the loop has iterated over all characters in the string.
