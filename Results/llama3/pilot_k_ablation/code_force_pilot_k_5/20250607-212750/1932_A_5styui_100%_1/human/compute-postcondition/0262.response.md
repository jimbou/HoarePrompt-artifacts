Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by a string of n characters. It then counts the number of coins ('@') in each string, ignoring any strings that contain thorns ('*') after the first coin, and prints the total number of coins for each test case. The function repeats this process for all test cases provided in the input.**
