The only variable in the loop head is variable  j, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `b`. If `j` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4 and the length of `b` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and the length of `b` must be at least 5.
State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 5, `s` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3 (depending on the first character of `b` and the previous value of `s`). If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
