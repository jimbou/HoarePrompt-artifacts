Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is at least 2, i is 1, s is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, j is equal to the length of string b, and the total number of '@' in string b which is s is being printed
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 0 or 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 1 character where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 or if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0 or 1. If the current character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 or if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 2 or 3. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If the current character in `b` is not '*', the program continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 3 or 4. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If the current character in `b` is not '*', the program continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 4 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 4 or 5. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If the current character in `b` is not '*', the program continues with the current state.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
