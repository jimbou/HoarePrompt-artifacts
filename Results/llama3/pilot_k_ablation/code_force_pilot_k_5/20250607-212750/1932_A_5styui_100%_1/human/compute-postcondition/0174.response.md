Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, `s` is either 2 if the first character of `b` is '@' or 1 if the first character of `b` is not '@'**.

The value of `s` is incremented by 1. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` was initially 1, so now it becomes 2. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` was initially 0, so now it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.
