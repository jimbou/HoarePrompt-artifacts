The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `b` has at least 4 characters. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 5 characters.
State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, stdin is empty. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is increased by 1. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), then either `j` is equal to the last index of `b` or the cell at index `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
