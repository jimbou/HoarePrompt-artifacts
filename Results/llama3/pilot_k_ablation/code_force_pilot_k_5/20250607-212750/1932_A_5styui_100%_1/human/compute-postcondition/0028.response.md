Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1 or 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 2, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. This means that the values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, `stdin`, and `j` remain unchanged, but the program execution is interrupted and we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
