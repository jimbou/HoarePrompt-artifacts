Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer greater than 6, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 6. If the cell at position `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
