Output State: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `s` is either 1 or 2, `j` is 1, and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to be either 1 or 2, since it was initially either 0 or 1 and was incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
