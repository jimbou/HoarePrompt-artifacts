Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, stdin contains 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The stdin still contains 2 inputs, each consisting of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters.
