Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 4 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 3 or 4. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement due to the `break` statement. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters.
