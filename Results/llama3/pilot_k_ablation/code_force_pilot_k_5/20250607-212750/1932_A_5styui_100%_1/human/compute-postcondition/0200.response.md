Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `a`, `i`, `d`, and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still 4. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin is still empty.
