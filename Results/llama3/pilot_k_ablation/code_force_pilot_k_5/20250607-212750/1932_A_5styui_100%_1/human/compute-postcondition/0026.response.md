Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 1, 2, or 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 2, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 3. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the next cell contains thorns. If `j` is not equal to the last index of string `b`, the program continues executing without any changes if the next cell does not contain thorns.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The program continues executing without any changes unless the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', in which case it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if the next cell contains thorns or if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`.
