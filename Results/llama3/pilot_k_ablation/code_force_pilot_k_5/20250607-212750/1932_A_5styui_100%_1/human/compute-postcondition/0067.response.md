Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 1 character where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, and the first character of `b` is not '@'. If `b[j]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 or if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'.***
