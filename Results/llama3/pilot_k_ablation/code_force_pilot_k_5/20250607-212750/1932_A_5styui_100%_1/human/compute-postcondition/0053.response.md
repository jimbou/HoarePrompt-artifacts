The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and `a` must be greater than 1.
State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is equal to the length of string `b`, and the total number of '@' in string `b` which is `s` is being printed**
