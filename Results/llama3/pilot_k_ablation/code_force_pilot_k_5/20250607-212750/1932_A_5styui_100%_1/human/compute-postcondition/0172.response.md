Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, and stdin is empty. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0, and if the first character of `b` is '*' and the second character is '*', or if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
