Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0 or 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 1, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the characters in string `b` and the value of `s` are still valid.
