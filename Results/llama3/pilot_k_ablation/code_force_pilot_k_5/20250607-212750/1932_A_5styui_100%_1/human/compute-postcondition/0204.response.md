Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, stdin is empty. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is increased by 1. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), then either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is the last index of `b` or the cell at index `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*'). Otherwise, no action is taken.***
