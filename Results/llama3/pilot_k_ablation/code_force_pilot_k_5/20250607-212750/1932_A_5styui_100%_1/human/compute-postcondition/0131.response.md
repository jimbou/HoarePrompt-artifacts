Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, `s` is either 0, 1 or 2 (depending on the first character of `b`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the current loop or if statement.
