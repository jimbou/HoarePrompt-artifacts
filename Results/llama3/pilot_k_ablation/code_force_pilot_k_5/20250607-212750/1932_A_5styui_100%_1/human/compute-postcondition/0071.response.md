Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 0 or 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the first character of `b` is '*' and either `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 or the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement under certain conditions related to the string `b` and the variable `j`. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, and `b` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains the same input.
