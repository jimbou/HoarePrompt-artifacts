To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the state of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than the length of `b`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `b` has `d` characters, where `d` is an integer between 1 and 50.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The length of `b` remains the same, but since `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` must have at least 2 characters for the loop to execute again.

State: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*') or if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is either 0 or 1 and no changes are made.**
