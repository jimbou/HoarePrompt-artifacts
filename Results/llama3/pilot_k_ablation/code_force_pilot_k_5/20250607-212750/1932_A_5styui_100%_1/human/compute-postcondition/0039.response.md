Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, and stdin contains 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters. If `j` is equal to the second last character of string `b`, or if the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
