Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 0 or 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain the same, and the stdin still contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. The conditions related to the first character of `b` and the value of `s` also remain the same.
