Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 4, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` does not contain a coin ('@'), then if `j` is equal to the second last character of string `b`, or if the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `j` is not equal to the last character of string `b`, and the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
