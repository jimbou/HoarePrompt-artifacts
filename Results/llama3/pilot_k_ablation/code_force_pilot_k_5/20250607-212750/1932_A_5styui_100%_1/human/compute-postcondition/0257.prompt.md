Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is at least 5, i is 4, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), j is equal to the length of b, s is 0, and stdin is empty, and the total number of coins ('@') in b which is not equal to s is being printed
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `s` is either 0 or 1, and `stdin` is empty. If the first character of `b` is a coin ('@'), then `s` is 1 and the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed. Otherwise, `s` is 0, the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed, and the first character of `b` is not a coin ('@'). If `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is less than `d-1`, and the current value of `b[j]` is '*', then if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*') or if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is either 0 or 1 and no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains no coin ('.'), then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*') or if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is either 0 or 1 and no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is either 3 or 4. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains no coin ('.'), then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or 2 and no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at position `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is 1. If the cell at position `j` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), then either the cell at position `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*') or `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the cell at position `j` in `b` is empty ('.'), then no changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
