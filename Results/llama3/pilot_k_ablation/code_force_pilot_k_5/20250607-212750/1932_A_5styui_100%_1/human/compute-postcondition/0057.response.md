Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 1 character where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, and the current value of `b[j]` is '@' (a cell with a coin).**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still at least 2, `i` is still 1, `d` is still an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is still a string of at least 1 character with the specified properties, `j` is still 0, and the stdin still contains 1 input. The current value of `b[j]` is still '@' (a cell with a coin).
