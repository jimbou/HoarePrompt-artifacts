Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 0 or 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the first character of `b` is '*' or if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.***
