Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `s` is 0, the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed, and the first character of `b` is not a coin ('@'). If `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is less than `d-1`, and the current value of `b[j]` is '*', then if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
