Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0 or 1, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, j is 0, b is a string that must have at least 1 character. If the character at index j in string b is '@', then s is 1. If the character at index j in string b is '*', then if j is equal to the last index of string b or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1 or 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 1, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0 or 1. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the next cell contains thorns. If `j` is not equal to the last index of string `b`, the program continues executing without any changes if the next cell does not contain thorns.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 2, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 3. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is not '@' or '*', then the program continues executing without any changes. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if the next cell contains thorns. If `j` is not equal to the last index of string `b`, the program continues executing without any changes if the next cell does not contain thorns.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 3, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` does not contain a coin ('@'), then if `j` is equal to the second last character of string `b`, or if the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 4, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` does not contain a coin ('@'), then if `j` is equal to the second last character of string `b`, or if the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `j` is not equal to the last character of string `b`, and the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
