Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `s` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. If `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, or if the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
