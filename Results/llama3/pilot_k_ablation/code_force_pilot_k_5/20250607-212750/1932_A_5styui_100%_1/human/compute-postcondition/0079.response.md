Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0 or 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. The value of `s` depends on the current character in `b`. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0 or 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
