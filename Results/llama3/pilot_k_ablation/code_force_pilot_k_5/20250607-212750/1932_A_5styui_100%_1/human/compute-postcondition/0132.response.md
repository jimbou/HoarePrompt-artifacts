Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, `s` is either 0, 1 or 2 (depending on the first character of `b`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. However, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
