Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `s` depends on the first character of `b`. If the first character is '@', then `s` is 1; otherwise, `s` is 0.
