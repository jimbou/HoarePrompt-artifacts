Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, `s` is either 1 or 2 (depending on the first character of `b`), and `stdin` is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1. Since `s` was initially either 0 or 1, it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
