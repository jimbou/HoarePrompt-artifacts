Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, `s` is 0, stdin is empty, the first character of `b` is not '@', and the current character of `b` at index `j` is '*', and `j` is not equal to the last index of `b`. The current character of `b` at index `j + 1` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the conditions about the string `b` and the indices `j` and `j+1` are still valid.
