Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1 or 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 2, `b` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.***
