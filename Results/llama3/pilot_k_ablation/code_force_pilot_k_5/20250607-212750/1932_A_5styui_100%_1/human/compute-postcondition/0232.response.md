Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*') or if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is either 0 or 1 and no changes are made.***
