Postcondition: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0 or 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 1, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the character at index `j + 1` in string `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.**
