Postcondition: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is either 3 or 4. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains no coin ('.'), then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `j` is equal to the last index of string `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the cell at index `j + 1` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is either 1 or 2 and no changes are made.**
