Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 0, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', meaning the current cell contains thorns, and `j` is not equal to the last index of string `b`, and the character at index `j` + 1 in string `b` is '*', meaning the next cell contains thorns, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains a - 2 inputs. The string `b` still has at least 1 character, and the current cell and the next cell still contain thorns.
