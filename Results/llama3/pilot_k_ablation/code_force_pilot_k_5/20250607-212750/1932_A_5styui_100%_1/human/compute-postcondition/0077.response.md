The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `b` is a string of at least 2 characters. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 and `b` must have at least 3 characters.
State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0 or 1. If the current character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 or if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.**
