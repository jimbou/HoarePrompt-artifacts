Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 0, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character, and the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', meaning the current cell contains thorns, and `j` is not equal to the last index of string `b`. If the character at index `j` + 1 in string `b` is '*', meaning the next cell contains thorns, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.***
