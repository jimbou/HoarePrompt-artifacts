The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than `len(b)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `b` is a string that must have at least 1 character. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `b` must have at least 2 characters.
State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0 or 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 1, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.**
