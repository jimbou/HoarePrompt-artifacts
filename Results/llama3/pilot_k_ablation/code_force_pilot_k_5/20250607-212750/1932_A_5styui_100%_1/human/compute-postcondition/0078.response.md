Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 2 or 3. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1 or if the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*'. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are still the same, but the value of `s` has changed. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is now 2 or 3. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is now 1 or 2.
