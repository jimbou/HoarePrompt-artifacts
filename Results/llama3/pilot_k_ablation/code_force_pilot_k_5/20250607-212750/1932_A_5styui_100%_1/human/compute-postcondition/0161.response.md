Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, and `s` is 1. The current value of `b` at index `j` is '@', indicating a cell with a coin.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The string `b` still has `d` characters, where the first character is '.' (empty cell), and the current character at index `j` (which is 0) is '@' (cell with a coin). The values of `a`, `i`, and `d` are still the same, and stdin is still empty.
