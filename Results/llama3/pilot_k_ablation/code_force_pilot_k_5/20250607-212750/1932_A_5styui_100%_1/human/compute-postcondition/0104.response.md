Output State: **a is at least 2, i is 1, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), j is equal to the length of string b, s is 0, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters.**

In this output state, the value of s has been updated to 0, while the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters.
