Output State: **a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters.**

In this output state, the value of `a` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains 0 as it is not affected by the code. The value of `s` remains 0 for the same reason. 

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `d`. Since the input is an integer between 1 and 50, `d` becomes an integer between 1 and 50. 

The second line assigns the string value of the input to `b`. Since the input is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `b` becomes a string of `d` characters with the specified properties.

The code consumes two inputs from stdin, leaving `a - 2` inputs remaining in stdin. Each remaining input is an integer `n` (1 <= `n` <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters.
