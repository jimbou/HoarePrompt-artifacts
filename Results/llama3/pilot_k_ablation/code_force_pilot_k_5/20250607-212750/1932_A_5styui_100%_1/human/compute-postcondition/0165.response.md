Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, `s` is 0, stdin is empty, the first character of `b` is not '@', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The values of `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged, and the stdin remains empty. The first character of `b` is still not '@', and the current character of `b` at index `j` is still '*'.
