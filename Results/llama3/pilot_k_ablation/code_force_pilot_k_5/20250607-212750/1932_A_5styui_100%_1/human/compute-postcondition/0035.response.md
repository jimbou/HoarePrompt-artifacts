Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 0, 1, 2, or 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain the same. The stdin still contains two inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters.
