Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
