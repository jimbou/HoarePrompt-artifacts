Output State: **a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), j is equal to the last index of string b, and the character at index j in string b is '*', meaning the current cell contains thorns, stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables a, i, s, d, b, j, and stdin remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
