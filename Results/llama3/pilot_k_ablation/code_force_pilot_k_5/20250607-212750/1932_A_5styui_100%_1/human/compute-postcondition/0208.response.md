Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is 0, and stdin is empty, and the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been reset to 0, but the total number of coins ('@') in `b` is still being printed, which is not equal to the new value of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
