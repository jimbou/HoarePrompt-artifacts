Output State: **a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains a - 1 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is always empty ('.').**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `a`. Since the input is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `a` becomes an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive. The second line assigns the value 0 to `s`. No other variables are affected. The stdin contains a - 1 inputs because one input is consumed by the first line. Each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is always empty ('.').
