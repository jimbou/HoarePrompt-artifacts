Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` is empty. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `j` is 0 and `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, or if the next cell `b[j + 1]` contains thorns '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
