To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for j in range(len(b)):`. This means that the only variable that can be adjusted is `j`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

The length of `b` is not explicitly stated, but since `j` is 2 and the loop is still executing, we know that the length of `b` must be at least 3.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, `s` is either 0 or 1 (depending on the first character of `b`), and `stdin` is empty.**
