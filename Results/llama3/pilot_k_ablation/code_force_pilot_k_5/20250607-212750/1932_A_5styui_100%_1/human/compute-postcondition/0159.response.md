According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` has at least 1 character the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to the length of string `b`. So for the loop to be executed  the string `b` must have at least 1 character and `j` is 0.
State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, `s` is 0, and stdin is empty**
