Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, and `stdin` is empty. If the cell at position `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is 1. If the cell at position `j` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), then either the cell at position `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*') or `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the cell at position `j` in `b` is empty ('.'), then no changes are made.***
