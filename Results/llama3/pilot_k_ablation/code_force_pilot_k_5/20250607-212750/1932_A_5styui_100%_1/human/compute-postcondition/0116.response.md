Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, `s` is 0, `stdin` is empty, the first character of `b` is not '@', the current value of `b[j]` is '*', and `j` is not equal to the last index of `b`. The current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state, but we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside. The string `b` still has the same properties, and the current character at index `j` is still '*', and the next character at index `j + 1` is also '*'.
