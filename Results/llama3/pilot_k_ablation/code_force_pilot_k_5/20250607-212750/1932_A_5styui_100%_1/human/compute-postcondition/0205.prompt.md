Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is at least 4, i is 3, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), j is equal to the length of string b, s is 0, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, and stdin is empty. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0, and if the first character of `b` is '*' and the second character is '*', or if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 1, and stdin is empty. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `s` is 1. Otherwise, `s` is 0. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is either 2 if the first character of `b` is '@' or 1 if the first character of `b` is not '@'. If the current character in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, or if the next character in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, stdin is empty. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is increased by 1. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains thorns ('*'), the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, stdin is empty. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is increased by 1. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), then either `j` is equal to the last index of `b` or the cell at index `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, stdin is empty. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is increased by 1. If the cell at index `j` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), then either we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is the last index of `b` or the cell at index `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*'). Otherwise, no action is taken.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
