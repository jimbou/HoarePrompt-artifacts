Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 3 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 2 or 3. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the program will exit the current loop or conditional statement and continue executing the code outside of it.
