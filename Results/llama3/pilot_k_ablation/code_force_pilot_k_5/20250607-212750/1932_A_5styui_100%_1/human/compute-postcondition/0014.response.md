Postcondition: ***a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If j is equal to the last index of string b, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the character at index j + 1 in string b is '*', meaning the next cell contains thorns, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.***
