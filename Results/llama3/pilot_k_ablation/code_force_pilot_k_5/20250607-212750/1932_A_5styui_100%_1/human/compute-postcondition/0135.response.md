Postcondition: ***`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, `s` is either 0, 1 or 2 (depending on the first character of `b`). If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
