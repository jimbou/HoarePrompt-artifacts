The only object in the loop head is variable  j and string b, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string b.  If the string has at least 3 characters the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, string b has at least 2 characters, j is 2. So for the loop to be executed one more time the string must have at least 3 characters and the j is 3.
State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, stdin is empty.**
