Output State: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is equal to the total number of coins ('@') in `b`, and `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `j` will be equal to the length of string `b`, and the value of `s` will be equal to the total number of coins ('@') in string `b`. The values of `a`, `i`, `d`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
