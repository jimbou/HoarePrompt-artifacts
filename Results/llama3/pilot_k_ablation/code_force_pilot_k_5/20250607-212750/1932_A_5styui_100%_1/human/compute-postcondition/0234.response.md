Output State: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 2 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, `s` is either 2 or 3 if the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), and `s` is either 1 or 2 if the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains no coin ('.'), and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the cell at index `j` in string `b` contains no coin ('.'), then `s` is either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain the same.
