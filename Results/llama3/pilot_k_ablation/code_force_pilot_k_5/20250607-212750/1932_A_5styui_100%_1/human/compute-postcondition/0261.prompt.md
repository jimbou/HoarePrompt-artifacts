Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is an integer between 1 and 1000 inclusive, s is 0, stdin contains a - 1 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is always empty ('.').
Code of the loop:
for i in range(a):
    d = int(input())
    b = input()
    for j in range(len(b)):
        if b[j] == '@':
            s = s + 1
        elif b[j] == '*':
            if j == len(b) - 1:
                break
            elif b[j + 1] == '*':
                break
    print(s)
    s = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: a is at least 1, i is 0, s is 0, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), stdin contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, j is equal to the length of string b, and the total number of '@' in string b which is s is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: a is at least 2, i is 1, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), j is equal to the length of string b, s is 0, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of string `b`, `s` is 0, and stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is 0, and stdin is empty, and the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is 0, and `stdin` is empty, and the total number of coins in string `b` which is `s` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
