Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 1 or 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 1, `b` is a string that must have at least 2 characters. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '@', then `s` is 2. If the character at index `j` in string `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of string `b` or the next cell contains thorns, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any changes.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `s` has been incremented by 1. If `s` was initially 0, it is now 1. If `s` was initially 1, it is now 2. All other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the character at index `j` in string `b` are still applicable.
