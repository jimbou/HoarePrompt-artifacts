Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, `s` is increased by 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The condition that if the cell at index `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is increased by 1, is still valid. The condition that if the cell at index `j` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), then either `j` is equal to the last index of `b` or the cell at index `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*'), in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, is also still valid.
