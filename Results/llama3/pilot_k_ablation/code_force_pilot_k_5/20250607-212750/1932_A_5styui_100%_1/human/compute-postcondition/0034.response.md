Output State: **`a` is at least 1, `i` is 0, `s` is 1, 2, 3, or 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` contains a - 2 inputs: each input is an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of `n` characters, `j` is 3, `b` is a string that must have at least 4 characters.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be 1, 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
