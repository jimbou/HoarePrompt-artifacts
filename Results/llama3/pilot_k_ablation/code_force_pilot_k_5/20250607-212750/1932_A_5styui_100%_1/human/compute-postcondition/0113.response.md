Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, `s` is 0, `stdin` is empty, the first character of `b` is not '@', and the current value of `b[j]` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, `s`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The first character of `b` is still not '@', and the current value of `b[j]` is still '*'.
