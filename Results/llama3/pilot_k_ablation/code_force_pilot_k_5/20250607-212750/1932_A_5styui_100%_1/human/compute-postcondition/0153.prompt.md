Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: a is at least 3, i is 2, d is an integer between 1 and 50, b is a string of d characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), j is equal to the length of string b, s is 0, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for j in range(len(b)):
    if b[j] == '@':
        s = s + 1
    elif b[j] == '*':
        if j == len(b) - 1:
            break
        elif b[j + 1] == '*':
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `stdin` is empty. If the first character of `b` is '@', then `j` is 0 and `s` is 1. If the first character of `b` is not '@', then `s` is 0. If the first character of `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, or if the next cell `b[j + 1]` contains thorns '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 3, `s` is either 0, 1 or 2 (depending on the first character of `b`), and `stdin` is empty. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', then `s` is either 1 or 2. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, `s` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3 (depending on the first character of `b` and the previous value of `s`). If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 5. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', then `s` is either 3 or 4. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `s` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3 (depending on the first character of `b` and the previous value of `s`).

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer greater than 6, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 6. If the cell at position `j` in `b` contains a coin ('@'), then `s` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `j` is equal to `len(b) - 1` or if the cell at position `j + 1` in `b` contains thorns ('*').




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
