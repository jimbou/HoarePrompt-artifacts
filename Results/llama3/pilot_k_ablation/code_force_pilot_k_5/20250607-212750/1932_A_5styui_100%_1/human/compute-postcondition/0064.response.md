Output State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `s` is 0, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 1 character where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is less than the length of `b` - 1, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, and the first character of `b` is not '@'. The current value of `b[j]` is '*', and the current value of `b[j + 1]` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `s`, `d`, `b`, `j` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. The first character of `b` is still not '@', and the current values of `b[j]` and `b[j + 1]` are still '*'.
