To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `b`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of string `b`. If the length of `b` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 0, `s` is 0, `stdin` is empty**
