Output State: **`a` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, and `j` remain unchanged. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
