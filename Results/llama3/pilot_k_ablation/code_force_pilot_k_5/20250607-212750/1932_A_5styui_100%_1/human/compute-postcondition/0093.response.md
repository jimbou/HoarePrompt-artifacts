The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `b`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `b`. If `j` is less than the length of `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3 and `b` is a string of at least 3 characters. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4. The length of `b` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`a` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of at least 4 characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 4, stdin contains 1 input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters. If the current character in `b` is '@', then `s` is 3 or 4. If the current character in `b` is not '@', then `s` is 1 or 2. If the current character in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the length of `b` minus 1, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if the next character in `b` is '*', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state. If the current character in `b` is not '*', the program continues with the current state.**
