The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `a` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `a` must be greater than 4.
State: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the length of `b`, `s` is 0, and stdin is empty, and the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed**
