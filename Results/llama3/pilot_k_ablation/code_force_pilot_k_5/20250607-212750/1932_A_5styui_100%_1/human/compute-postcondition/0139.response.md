Output State: **`a` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is 5, `s` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3 (depending on the first character of `b` and the previous value of `s`). If the character at index `j` in `b` is '@', then `s` is either 2 or 3. If the character at index `j` in `b` is '*', then if `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, or if the character at index `j + 1` in `b` is '*', we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement, but the program continues to execute the outer loops or statements.
