Output State: **`a` is at least 5, `i` is 4, `d` is an integer between 1 and 50, `b` is a string of `d` characters where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns, and the first cell is always empty ('.'), `j` is equal to the last index of `b`, `s` is 0, the total number of coins ('@') in `b` which is not equal to `s` is being printed, and the first character of `b` is not a coin ('@'), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `a`, `i`, `d`, `b`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The total number of coins in `b` is still being printed and is not equal to `s`. The first character of `b` is still not a coin. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
