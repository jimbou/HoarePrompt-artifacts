Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `x + 3`, `ans` is either `x + 2` or `x + 1` if `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` equals 2, otherwise `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is reduced by 1, and there are `t-1` test cases remaining in the standard input. The values of `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. If the difference between the `i-th` and `(i-1)-th` elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 2` or `x + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`.
