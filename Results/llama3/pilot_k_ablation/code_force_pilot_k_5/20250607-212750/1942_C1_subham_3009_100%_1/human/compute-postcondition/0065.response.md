The only variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 1.
State: **t is greater than 1, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 1, ans is x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the value of ans which is x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2 is being printed**
