Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x` - 1, and stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. The current value of `i` is 1 and the difference between the first and second elements of `arr` is 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now `x` - 1. All other variables remain unchanged, including `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `i`. The difference between the first and second elements of `arr` is still 2, and there are still `t` - 1 test cases in stdin.
