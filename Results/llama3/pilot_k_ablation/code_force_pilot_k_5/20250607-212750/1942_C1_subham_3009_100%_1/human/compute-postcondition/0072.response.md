The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5). So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is 2 and `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5).
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, and `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in `arr` is 2, then `ans` is `x` - 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x` - 2.**
