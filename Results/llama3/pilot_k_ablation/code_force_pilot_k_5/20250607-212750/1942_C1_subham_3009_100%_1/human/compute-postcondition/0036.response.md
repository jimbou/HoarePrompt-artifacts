Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 4, `ans` is either `x + 2`, `x + 1`, or `x` depending on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was either `x + 1`, `x`, or `x - 1` depending on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`. Therefore, the new value of `ans` is either `x + 2`, `x + 1`, or `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
