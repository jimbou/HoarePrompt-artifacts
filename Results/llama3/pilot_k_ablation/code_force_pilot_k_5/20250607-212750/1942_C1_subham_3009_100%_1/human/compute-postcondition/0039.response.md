Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 5. If the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr` is 2, `ans` is either `x + 3`, `x + 2`, or `x + 1`. Otherwise, `ans` is either `x + 2`, `x + 1`, or `x` depending on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. The possible values of `ans` have been updated accordingly, taking into account the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`.
