Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, `ans` is either `x` or `x - 1` depending on the difference between the first and second elements of `arr`, and stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If the difference between the first and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is now `x`. Otherwise, `ans` is now `x - 1`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
