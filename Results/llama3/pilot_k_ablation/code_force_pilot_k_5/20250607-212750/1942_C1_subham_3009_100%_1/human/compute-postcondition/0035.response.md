To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(1, x + 1):`. The only variables in the loop head are `i` and `x`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `x + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. The value of `x` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 4, `ans` is either `x + 1`, `x`, or `x - 1` depending on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`.**
