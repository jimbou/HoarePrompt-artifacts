The only variable in the loop head is variable i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i. If i is less than x + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is x + 1, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5). So for the loop to be executed one more time i must be x + 2 and x must be greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5).
State: **t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 2, ans is either x or x - 1**
