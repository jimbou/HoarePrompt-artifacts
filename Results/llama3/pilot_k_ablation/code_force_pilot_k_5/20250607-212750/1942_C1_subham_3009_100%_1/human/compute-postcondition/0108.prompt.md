Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.
Code of the loop:
while t > 0:
    t -= 1
    [n, x, y] = map(int, input().split())
    arr = input().split()
    arr = [int(arr[i]) for i in range(x)]
    arr.sort()
    arr.append(n + arr[0])
    ans = x - 2
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 1. If the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in arr is 2, then ans is x - 1. Otherwise, ans remains x - 2, and ans is printed, where ans is either x - 1 or x - 2 depending on the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in arr
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 1, ans is either x + (x - 1) or x + (x - 2) depending on the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in arr, and ans is printed
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 1, ans is x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2, and stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the value of ans which is x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2 is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases. ans is x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2, and the value of ans which is x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2 is being printed
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x, ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr plus x - 2, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases, and the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr plus x - 2 is printed


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
