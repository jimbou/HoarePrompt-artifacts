The code prints the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `x - 2` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr` that have a difference of 2.

Since `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the value of `x - 2` is at least 0.

The number of pairs of adjacent elements in `arr` that have a difference of 2 depends on the specific elements in the list. However, since `arr` is sorted, we can deduce that the difference between any two adjacent elements is at most 1.

Therefore, the number of pairs of adjacent elements with a difference of 2 is 0, since no two adjacent elements in a sorted list can have a difference of 2.

So, the value of `ans` is simply `x - 2`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5))**
