Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(`n`, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is `x + 2`, `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either `x + 1` or `x`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
