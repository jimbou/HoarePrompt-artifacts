The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the list `arr` plus `x - 2`. Since `x` is the number of elements in `arr` and `arr` is a sorted list of distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the number of pairs of consecutive integers in `arr` is `x - 1`. Therefore, `ans` is equal to `x - 1 + x - 2`, which simplifies to `2x - 3`.

Output: **2x - 3 (where x is the number of elements in the sorted list arr)**
