Postcondition: **The program reads an integer t from stdin, followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, x, and y, and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. If the program is run as the main module, it processes the test cases and prints the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the list plus x - 2. If the program is not run as the main module, it does nothing.**
