Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x, ans is x - 2, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(1, x + 1):
    if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] == 2:
        ans += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, and stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the first and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is `x` - 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x` - 2.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, and stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. `ans` is either `x` or `x - 1` depending on the difference between the first and second elements of `arr`.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 2` or `x + 1`. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is not 2, then `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 3` or `x + 2`. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is not 2, then `ans` is either `x + 2` or `x + 1`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
