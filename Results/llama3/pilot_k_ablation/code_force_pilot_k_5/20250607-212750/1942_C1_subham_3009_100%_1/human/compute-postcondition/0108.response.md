Output State: **t is 0, stdin is empty, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x, ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr plus x - 2, and the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr plus x - 2 is printed.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of t is now 0. The input stream (stdin) is empty, as all test cases have been processed. The variables n, x, and y retain their values from the last iteration, and the array arr remains sorted. The variable i is still at its final value of x, and the variable ans holds the total count of pairs of consecutive integers in arr plus x - 2. This final value of ans has been printed as the output.
