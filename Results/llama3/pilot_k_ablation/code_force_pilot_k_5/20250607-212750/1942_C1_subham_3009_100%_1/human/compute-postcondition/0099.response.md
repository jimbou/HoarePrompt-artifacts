The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`.**
