Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, and stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the first and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is `x` - 1. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x` - 2.***
