Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x, ans is x - 2, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

Explanation:
The first line decrements the value of t by 1, making it greater than 0. The second line assigns the integer values of the input to n, x, and y, respectively. The third line assigns a list of x strings to arr. The fourth line converts each string in arr to an integer and sorts the list in ascending order. The fifth line appends the sum of n and the first element of arr to the end of arr. The sixth line assigns the value of x - 2 to ans. 

Note that the initial state of i is not modified by the code, so it remains x. The initial state of stdin is also not modified, so it still contains t - 1 test cases.
