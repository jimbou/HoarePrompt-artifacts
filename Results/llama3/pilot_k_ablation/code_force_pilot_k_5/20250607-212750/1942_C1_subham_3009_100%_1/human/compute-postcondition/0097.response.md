Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 3, `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was either `x` or `x - 1`, so the new value of `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
