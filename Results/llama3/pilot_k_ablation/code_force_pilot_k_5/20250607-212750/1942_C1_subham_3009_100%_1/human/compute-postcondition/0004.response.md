To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `x` is already greater than or equal to 2, we can conclude that the loop will execute. However, we need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the starting value of the loop, which is 1.

State: **t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, ans is x - 2, i is 1**
