Output State: **t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 4, ans is either x + 4 or x + 3**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was either `x + 3` or `x + 2`, it is now either `x + 4` or `x + 3`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
