The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and x, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `x + 3`, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5). For the loop to execute again `i` must be `x + 4` and `x` must be greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5).
State: **t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 4, ans is either x + 3 or x + 2**
