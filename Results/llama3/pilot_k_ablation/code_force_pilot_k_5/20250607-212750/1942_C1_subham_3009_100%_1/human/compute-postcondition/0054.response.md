Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is 3, `ans` is either x or x - 1, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Since `ans` was either `x - 1` or `x - 2` depending on the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i - 1]`, it is now either `x` or `x - 1`. The values of the other variables are not affected.
