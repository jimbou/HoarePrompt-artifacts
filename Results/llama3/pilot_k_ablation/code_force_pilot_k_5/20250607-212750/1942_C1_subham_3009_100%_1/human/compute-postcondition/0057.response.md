Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is 4, `ans` is either x or x - 1, and stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to be either `x` or `x - 1`, depending on the initial value of `ans`. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` was initially `x - 1`, and now it is `x`. Otherwise, `ans` was initially `x - 2`, and now it is `x - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
