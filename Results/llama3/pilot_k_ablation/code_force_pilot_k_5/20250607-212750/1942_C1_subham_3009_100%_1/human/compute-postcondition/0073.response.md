Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 2, `ans` is either `x` or `x - 1` depending on the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in `arr` plus 1, and `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5, `y` is still an integer, `arr` is still a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is still 2, and `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases. The value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, so it is now either `x` + 1 or `x` depending on the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in `arr`.
