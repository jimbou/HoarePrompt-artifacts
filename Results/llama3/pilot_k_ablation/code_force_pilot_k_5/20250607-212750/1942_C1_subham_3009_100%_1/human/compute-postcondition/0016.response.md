Postcondition: ***t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 3. If arr[i] - arr[i - 1] equals 2, then ans is either x + 2 or x + 1. Otherwise, ans is either x + 1 or x.***
