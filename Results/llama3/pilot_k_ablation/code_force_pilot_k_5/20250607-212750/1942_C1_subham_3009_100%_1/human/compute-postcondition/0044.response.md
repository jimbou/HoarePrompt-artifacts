According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than 0 and reduced by 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, t must be greater than 1.

State: **t is greater than 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is 0, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x + 1, ans is either x + (x - 1) or x + (x - 2) depending on the difference between the elements at index i and i-1 in arr, and ans is printed**
