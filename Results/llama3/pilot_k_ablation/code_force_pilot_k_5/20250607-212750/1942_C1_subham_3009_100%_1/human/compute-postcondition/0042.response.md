The code prints the value of `ans`, which is either `x + (x - 1)` or `x + (x - 2)`, depending on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`.

Since `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `i` is `x + 1`, the elements at index `i` and `i-1` are consecutive integers.

If the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` is 1, then `ans` is `x + (x - 1)`. Otherwise, `ans` is `x + (x - 2)`.

Output: **x + (x - 1) or x + (x - 2) (where x is the number of distinct integers in the sorted list arr)**
