Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 5 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 5, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 3` or `x + 2`. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is not 2, then `ans` is either `x + 2` or `x + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The conditions for `ans` are updated accordingly. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 3` or `x + 2`. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is not 2, then `ans` is either `x + 2` or `x + 1`. The number of test cases in stdin is still `t - 1`.
