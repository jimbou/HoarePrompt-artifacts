The `print(ans)` statement will print the value of `ans`, which is calculated as `x - 2` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `arr` that have a difference of 2.

Since `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, and `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the value of `ans` will depend on the specific values in `arr`.

However, without knowing the exact values in `arr`, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. But we can describe it as the result of the calculation `x - 2` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `arr` that have a difference of 2.

Output: **x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2 (where x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), and arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n)**
