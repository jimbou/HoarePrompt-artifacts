The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `x`. If `i` is less than `x + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `x` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is 3, and stdin contains t-2 test cases. If `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is 2, then `ans` is x - 1, otherwise `ans` is x - 2.**
