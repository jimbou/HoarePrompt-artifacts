To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 1. Since `x` is already greater than or equal to 2, we can conclude that `x` is at least 1. Therefore, we only need to adjust the state of `i` to be 1, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `ans` is `x` - 2, and `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases.**
