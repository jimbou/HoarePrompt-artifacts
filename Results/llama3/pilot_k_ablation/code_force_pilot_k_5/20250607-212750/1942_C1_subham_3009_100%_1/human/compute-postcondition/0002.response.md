To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the condition `t > 0`. The variable `t` is the only one in the loop head that needs adjustment.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can conclude that `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute at least once.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, stdin contains t test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains three integers n, x, and y (4 <= n <= 10^9, 2 <= x <= min(n, 2 * 10^5), y = 0). The second line contains x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
