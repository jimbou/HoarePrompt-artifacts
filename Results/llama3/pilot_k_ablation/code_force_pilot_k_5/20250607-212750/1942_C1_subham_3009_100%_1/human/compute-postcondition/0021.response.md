The code prints the value of `ans`, which is determined by the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in the sorted list `arr`.

Since `i` is equal to `x + 1`, and `x` is the number of distinct integers in `arr`, `i` is actually out of bounds for the list `arr`. However, based on the given condition, if the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr` is 2, then `ans` is `x - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` remains `x - 2`.

Since `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `x` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `min(n, 2 * 10^5)`, the difference between consecutive elements in `arr` is at least 1.

Therefore, the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr` cannot be 2, because `i` is out of bounds for the list `arr`. Hence, `ans` remains `x - 2`.

Output: **x - 2 (where x is the number of distinct integers in the sorted list arr)**
