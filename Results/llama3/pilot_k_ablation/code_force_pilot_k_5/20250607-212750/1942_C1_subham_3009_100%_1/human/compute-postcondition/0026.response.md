Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `ans` is either `x - 1` or `x - 2` depending on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`. The current value of `i` is 1 and the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr` is 2.**
