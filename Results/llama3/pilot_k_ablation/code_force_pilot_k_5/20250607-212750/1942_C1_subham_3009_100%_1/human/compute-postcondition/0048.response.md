Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is 1, `ans` is x - 1, stdin contains t-2 test cases, and the current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is 2.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `ans` being equal to `x - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions on `t`, `n`, `x`, `y`, `arr`, and `i` are still valid. Additionally, the current value of `arr[i] - arr[i - 1]` is still 2, and there are `t-2` test cases remaining in the stdin.
