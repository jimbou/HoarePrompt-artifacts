Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x, ans is the number of pairs of consecutive integers in arr plus x - 2, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` has reached the value of `x`, and the variable `ans` has been updated to be the number of pairs of consecutive integers in the list `arr` plus `x - 2`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
