Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three integers (n, x, y) and a list of x distinct integers from 1 to n. It processes each test case by sorting the list of integers, counting the number of pairs of consecutive integers, and printing the count plus x - 2. The function continues processing test cases until all input has been read.**
