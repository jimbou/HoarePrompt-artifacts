Output State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, `i` is x + 1, `ans` is either x or x - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains greater than 0 and reduced by 1, and there are `t-1` test cases left in the standard input. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 4. The value of `x` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to the minimum of `n` and 2 * 10^5. The value of `y` is still 0. The list `arr` is still a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The value of `i` is still `x + 1`. The value of `ans` is either `x` or `x - 1`, depending on whether the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr` is 2 or not.
