Output State: **t is greater than 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 4, x is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), y is an integer, arr is a sorted list of x distinct integers from 1 to n, i is x, and stdin contains t - 1 test cases. ans is x - 2 plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in arr that have a difference of 2.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the value of `i` is now equal to `x`, and the value of `ans` is `x - 2` plus the number of pairs of adjacent elements in `arr` that have a difference of 2. The values of `t`, `n`, `y`, and `arr` remain unchanged, and `stdin` still contains `t - 1` test cases.
