Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 4, stdin contains `t` - 1 test cases. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is 2, then `ans` is either `x + 2` or `x + 1`. If the difference between the third and second elements of `arr` is not 2, then `ans` is either `x + 1` or `x`.***
