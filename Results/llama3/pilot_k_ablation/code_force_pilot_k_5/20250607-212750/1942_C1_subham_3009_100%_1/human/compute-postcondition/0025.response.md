To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `x`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `x` is at least 1.

State: **`t` is greater than 0 and reduced by 1, `stdin` contains `t-1` test cases, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is 0, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 1, `ans` is either `x - 1` or `x - 2` depending on the difference between the elements at index `i` and `i-1` in `arr`**
