Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 4, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 4 and less than or equal to min(n, 2 * 10^5), `y` is an integer, `arr` is a sorted list of `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `i` is 4, `ans` is either `x` if the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in `arr` is 2, otherwise `ans` is `x` - 1, and `stdin` contains `t` - 1 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been incremented by 1. If the difference between the element at index `i` and the element at index `i - 1` in `arr` is 2, then `ans` is now `x`. Otherwise, `ans` is now `x` - 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
