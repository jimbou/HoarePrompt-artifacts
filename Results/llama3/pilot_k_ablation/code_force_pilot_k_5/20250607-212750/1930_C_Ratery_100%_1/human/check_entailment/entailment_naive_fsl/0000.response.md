Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. Here's why:

1. The program first calculates the sum of each element in the array with its index (1-indexed) and stores it in a new array `arr`.
2. It then sorts `arr` in descending order.
3. The program initializes the answer array `ans` with the first element of `arr`.
4. For each subsequent element `x` in `arr`, it checks if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`. If it is, it appends `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`. Otherwise, it appends `x` to `ans`.
5. Finally, it prints the elements of `ans` in the desired format.

The program works correctly because it ensures that the elements in `ans` are in decreasing order, and it handles the case where an element in `arr` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans` by appending `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`. This ensures that the resulting array `ans` is lexicographically largest.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
