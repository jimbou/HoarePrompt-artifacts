Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, parsing the number of test cases, the length of the array, and the array elements.

2. It calculates the sum of each element and its index (1-indexed) and stores them in the `arr` list. This is in line with the problem description.

3. The program sorts the `arr` list in descending order, which is necessary to find the lexicographically largest `b`.

4. It initializes the `ans` list with the largest element of `arr`. This is correct because the lexicographically largest `b` must start with the largest possible element.

5. The program then iterates over the rest of the `arr` list. If the current element `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, it appends `ans[-1] - 1` to `ans`. This is correct because if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element of `ans`, appending `x` to `ans` would not result in the lexicographically largest `b` (since `x` would be equal to the last element of `ans`, and we want the largest possible `b`). By appending `ans[-1] - 1`, we ensure that the next element of `ans` is smaller than the last element, which is necessary to get the lexicographically largest `b`.

6. If `x` is less than the last element of `ans`, the program appends `x` to `ans`. This is correct because `x` is already smaller than the last element of `ans`, so appending `x` to `ans` will not affect the lexicographically largest `b`.

7. Finally, the program prints the `ans` list, which is the lexicographically largest `b` that can be constructed from the input array.

Correctness: **True**
