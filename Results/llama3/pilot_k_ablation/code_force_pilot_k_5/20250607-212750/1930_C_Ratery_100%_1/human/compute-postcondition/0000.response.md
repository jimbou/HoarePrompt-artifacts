Output State: **stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, ans is a list containing the largest integer in arr.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, and `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers, each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order. The list `ans` contains the largest integer in `arr`. Stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been processed by the code.
