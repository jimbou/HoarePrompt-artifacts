Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr`, and the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the third element in the list, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains three elements: the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr`, and the third element in the list.
