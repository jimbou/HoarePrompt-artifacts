Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, n is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, arr is a list of n positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, ans is a list containing the largest integer in arr.
Code of the loop:
for x in arr[1:]:
    if x >= ans[-1]:
        ans.append(ans[-1] - 1)
    else:
        ans.append(x)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr` and the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, `x` is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, and the value one less than the last element in `ans` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, otherwise the third element in the list, `x` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, and the value one less than the last element in `ans` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, otherwise the third element in the list, `x` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, and either the value one less than the last element in `ans` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or `x` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, `x` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, and either the value one less than the last element in `ans` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or `x` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, and either one less than the last element in `ans` or `x` which is the fourth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
