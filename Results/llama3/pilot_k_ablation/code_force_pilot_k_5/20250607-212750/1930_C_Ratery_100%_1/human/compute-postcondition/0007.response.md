The only variable in the loop head is variable  x, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is the next element in the list `arr[1:]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time `x` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr` and the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, `x` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
