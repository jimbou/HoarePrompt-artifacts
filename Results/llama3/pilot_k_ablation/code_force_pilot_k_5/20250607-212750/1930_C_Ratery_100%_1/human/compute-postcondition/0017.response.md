Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, the value one less than the last element in `ans` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, otherwise the third element in the list, and `x`, `x` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The list `ans` now contains an additional element, which is the value of `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `arr` is still sorted in descending order, and `n` is still a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5. The value of `x` is still the third element in the list. The number of test cases in stdin has decreased by one.
