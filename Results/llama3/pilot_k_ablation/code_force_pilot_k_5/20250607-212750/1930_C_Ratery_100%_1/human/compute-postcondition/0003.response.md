Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of n positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr` and the second largest integer in `arr` which is also the current value of `x`, `x` is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases remains the same, the list of integers `arr` is still sorted in descending order, the list `ans` now contains the two largest integers in `arr`, where the second largest integer is the current value of `x`, and the value of `x` is still the second element in the list.
