Output State: **`stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr` and the second element in `arr`, `x` is the second element in the list, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, and `x` is less than the last element in `ans`.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to include the second element in the list `arr`, which is `x`. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `ans` now contains two elements: the largest integer in `arr` and the second element in `arr`, which is `x`. The condition that `x` is less than the last element in `ans` is still valid, as the last element in `ans` is now `x` itself.
