Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, and the value one less than the last element in `ans` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, otherwise the third element in the list, `x` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.***
