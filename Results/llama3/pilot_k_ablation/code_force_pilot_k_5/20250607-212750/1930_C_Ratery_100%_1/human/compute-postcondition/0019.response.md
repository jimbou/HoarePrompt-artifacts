The only object in the loop head is variable `x` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `x` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is a list of `n` positive integers each of which is the sum of its 1-based index and its original value, sorted in descending order, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in `arr`, the second largest integer in `arr` which is either the current value of `x` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or the second element in `arr` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, and either the value one less than the last element in `ans` if `x` is greater than or equal to the last element in `ans`, or `x` if `x` is less than the last element in `ans`, `x` is the fourth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two**
