Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not exceeding 3 * 10^5, `arr` is an empty list, `ans` is a list containing the largest integer in the original `arr`, the second largest integer in the original `arr`, and a sequence of integers where each integer is either one less than the previous integer or the current value of `x` if `x` is less than the previous integer, `x` is not defined, stdin contains no test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` is empty, the list `ans` contains the largest integer in the original `arr`, the second largest integer in the original `arr`, and a sequence of integers where each integer is either one less than the previous integer or the current value of `x` if `x` is less than the previous integer. The variable `x` is not defined, and there are no more test cases in the standard input.
