Precondition: **stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two inputs: first an integer (n) and then a list of n integers. The integer is a positive integer and does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 * 10^5. The integers in the list are positive integers and do not exceed 10^9.**
