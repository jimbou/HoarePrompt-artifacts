stdin contains multiple inputs: the first input is an integer (the number of test cases), followed by multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three inputs: the first input is two space-separated integers (the number of elements in the array and the number of queries), the second input is a space-separated list of integers (elements of the array), and the third input is a list of space-separated pairs of integers (queries).
