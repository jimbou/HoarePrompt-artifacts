#State of the program right berfore the function call: cast is a function that takes a string and returns a value of a specific type, and input() is a function that returns a string of space-separated values.
    return map(cast, input().split())
    #The program returns a map object that applies the cast function to each string in the list of space-separated values returned by input().split(), resulting in a sequence of values of a specific type.

#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes a string of space-separated values as input, applies a specified casting function to each value, and returns a sequence of values of the specified type.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements of any type and predicate is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value.

    #State: *`arr` is a list of elements of any type, `predicate` is a function that takes one argument and returns a boolean value, `l` and `r` are integers where `l` is equal to `r` or `l` is one less than `r`. The `predicate` function returns `False` when applied to the element at index `l` in the `arr` list.
    return None
    #The program returns None

#Overall this is what the function does:This function performs a binary search on a list of elements using a given predicate function. It returns the index of the first element in the list for which the predicate function returns True, or None if no such element is found. The function takes a list of elements and a predicate function as input and returns either an integer index or None.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, and the function func_1 and func_2 are defined elsewhere in the program.

    #State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation.
    for i in range(q):
        l, r = func_1(int)

        upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
        
        if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:

If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array that satisfies a specific XOR condition. It takes no explicit parameters but uses the values of n, q, a, func_1, and func_2 from the external program state. The function iterates over q queries, each specifying a range [l, r] within the array. For each query, it checks if the XOR of all elements in the range [l, r] is equal to the XOR of all elements in the range [0, l-1]. If the XOR values are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it searches for the nearest indices within the range [l, r] that have the same XOR value as the range [0, l-1] and [0, r], respectively. If such indices exist and are within the specified range, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function modifies the external program state by printing 'Yes' or 'No' for each query and leaving the values of n, q, a, x, inds, i, l, r, lower, and upper in a specific state after execution.
