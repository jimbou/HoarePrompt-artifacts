Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray within a given array satisfies a specific XOR condition. The program uses a combination of functions to achieve this goal.

Function 1 is used to read input from the user and convert it into a specific data type. Function 2 is a binary search function that finds the index of the first element in a list that satisfies a given predicate.

Function 3 is the main function that solves the problem. It first reads the input array and the number of queries. It then calculates the XOR of all elements in the array and stores the results in a list. It also creates a dictionary that maps each XOR value to a list of indices where that value appears in the array.

For each query, the function checks if the XOR of all elements in the specified range is equal to the XOR of all elements in the range [0, l-1]. If the XOR values are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it searches for the nearest indices within the range [l, r] that have the same XOR value as the range [0, l-1] and [0, r], respectively. If such indices exist and are within the specified range, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'.

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
