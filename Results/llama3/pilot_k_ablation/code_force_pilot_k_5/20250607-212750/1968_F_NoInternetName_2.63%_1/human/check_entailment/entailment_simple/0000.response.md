Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is interesting, i.e., whether it can be divided into k>1 parts such that the bitwise XOR of values from each part are equal.

The program uses a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of the XOR values of the prefix sums of the array `a`. The prefix sums are calculated using the XOR operation, and the indices are stored in the dictionary with the XOR value as the key.

For each query, the program checks if the XOR value of the subarray is equal to the XOR value of the prefix sum up to the left boundary of the subarray. If they are equal, it means that the subarray can be divided into two parts with equal XOR values, and the program prints "Yes".

If the XOR values are not equal, the program uses the `func_2` function to find the lower and upper bounds of the indices in the dictionary that correspond to the XOR value of the subarray. The `func_2` function uses a binary search approach to find the bounds.

If the upper bound is greater than the lower bound and both bounds are within the subarray, it means that the subarray can be divided into three parts with equal XOR values, and the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem, and the use of the dictionary and binary search approach makes it efficient.

Correctness: **True**
