Correctness: **True**

Reasoning:

The given program is correct based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. The program correctly reads the input data, including the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, and the array elements themselves.
2. The program correctly calculates the XOR of all elements in the array and stores it in the `x` list.
3. The program correctly creates a dictionary `inds` that maps each XOR value to a list of indices where that value appears in the array.
4. The program correctly iterates over the queries and checks if the XOR of the elements in the specified range is equal to the XOR of all elements in the array. If it is, the program prints "Yes".
5. If the XOR values are not equal, the program correctly searches for the nearest indices within the range that have the same XOR value as the range [0, l-1] and [0, r], respectively. If such indices exist and are within the specified range, the program prints "Yes"; otherwise, it prints "No".

The program's logic is correct, and it correctly handles all possible cases. The use of binary search in `func_2` is also correct, as it efficiently finds the nearest indices with the desired XOR value.

Therefore, the program is correct, and the answer is **True**.
