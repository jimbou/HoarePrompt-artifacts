Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether a subarray is interesting, i.e., whether it can be divided into k consecutive segments such that the XOR of elements from each part is equal.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. The program first reads the number of test cases, the number of elements in the array, and the number of queries.

2. It then reads the array elements and calculates the prefix XOR array `x`. The prefix XOR array is used to efficiently calculate the XOR of any subarray in constant time.

3. The program also creates a dictionary `inds` to store the indices of the prefix XOR array. This dictionary is used to quickly find the indices of the prefix XOR array that match a given value.

4. For each query, the program checks if the XOR of the subarray is zero. If it is, the subarray is interesting, and the program prints "Yes".

5. If the XOR of the subarray is not zero, the program uses the `func_2` function to find the lower and upper bounds of the indices in the `inds` dictionary that match the XOR of the subarray. The `func_2` function performs a binary search to find these bounds.

6. The program then checks if the lower and upper bounds are within the range of the subarray and if there are at least two indices within this range. If both conditions are true, the subarray is interesting, and the program prints "Yes". Otherwise, it prints "No".

The program's logic is correct, and it efficiently solves the problem using the prefix XOR array and the dictionary of indices. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
