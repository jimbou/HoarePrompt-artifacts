The first line appends the result of the bitwise XOR operation between the last element in `x` (which is 0) and `i` (the first element in `a`) to the end of `x`. This means `x` now contains two elements: 0 and the result of 0 XOR `i`, which is simply `i`. The second line appends the index of the newly added element in `x` (which is the length of `x` minus 1, i.e., 1) to the list of indices in `inds` that correspond to the key `x[-1]` (which is `i`). Since `inds` initially only had a key 0, this operation adds a new key-value pair to `inds` where the key is `i` and the value is a list containing 1.

Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, x is a list containing two elements: 0 and i, inds is a dictionary with two keys: 0, which maps to a list containing a single element 0, and i, which maps to a list containing a single element 1.**
