Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is greater than 0, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 0, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[r] and the index lower + 1, upper is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[l - 1] and the index upper.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The code only introduces two new variables, `lower` and `upper`, which are assigned values based on the results of the `func_2` function calls. The `lower` variable is assigned the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[r]` and the index `lower + 1`, while the `upper` variable is assigned the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[l - 1]` and the index `upper`.
