The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and q, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `q`. If `i` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `q` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, `inds` is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, `i` is 2, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[r]` and the index `lower + 1`, `upper` is the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[l - 1]` and the index `upper`, `lower` is the value at index `lower + 1` in the list `inds[x[r]]`, `upper` is the value at index `upper` in the list `inds[x[l - 1]]`. If `upper` is greater than `lower` and `l` is less than or equal to `upper` which is less than or equal to `r` and (`l` is less than or equal to `lower` which is less than or equal to `r`), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**
