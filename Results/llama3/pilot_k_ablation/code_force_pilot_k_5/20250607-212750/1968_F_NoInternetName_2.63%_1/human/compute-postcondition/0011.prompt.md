Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0, which maps to a list containing a single element 0.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x.append(x[-1] ^ i)
    inds[x[-1]].append(len(x) - 1)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 1 element, x is a list containing two elements: 0 and i, inds is a dictionary with two keys: 0, which maps to a list containing a single element 0, and i, which maps to a list containing a single element 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, x is a list containing three elements: 0, the next element in a, and the result of the XOR operation between the next element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with two keys: 0, which maps to a list containing two elements 0 and the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 3 elements, x is a list containing four elements: 0, the next element in a, the result of the XOR operation between the next element in a and the index i, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, inds is a dictionary with three keys: 0, which maps to a list containing three elements 0, the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the index of the last element in x, the previous element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 1, and the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 2

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 4 elements, x is a list containing five elements: 0, the next element in a, the result of the XOR operation between the next element in a and the index i, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, inds is a dictionary with four keys: 0, which maps to a list containing three elements 0, the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the index of the last element in x, the previous element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 1, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 2, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 3, and the last element in x, which maps to a list containing a single element 4

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 4 elements, x is a list containing six elements: 0, the next element in a, the result of the XOR operation between the next element in a and the index i, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, inds is a dictionary with five keys: 0, which maps to a list containing three elements 0, the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the index of the last element in x, the previous element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 1, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 2, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 3, the last element in x, which maps to a list containing a single element 4, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element 5, and i is the next element in a




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
