Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, `inds` is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`**

The code calls the function `func_1` with an integer argument and assigns the returned values to `l` and `r`. The values of `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, and `i` remain unchanged. The function `func_1` is not defined in the given code snippet, so the exact values of `l` and `r` cannot be determined. However, it is clear that `l` and `r` are assigned the returned values from the function call.
