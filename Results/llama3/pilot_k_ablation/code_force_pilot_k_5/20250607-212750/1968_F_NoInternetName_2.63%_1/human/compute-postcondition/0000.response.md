Output State: **n and q are positive integers, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, x is a list containing a single element 0, inds is a dictionary with a single key 0, which maps to a list containing a single element 0.**

The code block executes as follows:

1. `n, q = func_1(int)`: This line calls the function `func_1` with the argument `int` and assigns the returned values to `n` and `q`. Since `n` and `q` are positive integers, their values are updated to the returned values.

2. `a = list(func_1(int))`: This line calls the function `func_1` with the argument `int` and assigns the returned value to `a`. Since `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, its value is updated to the returned list.

3. `x = [0]`: This line assigns a new list containing a single element 0 to `x`.

4. `inds = defaultdict(list)`: This line creates a new dictionary `inds` with a default value of an empty list.

5. `inds[0].append(0)`: This line appends the value 0 to the list associated with the key 0 in the dictionary `inds`.

After executing all the lines, the final state of the variables is as follows:

* `n` and `q` are positive integers, with their values updated to the returned values from the function `func_1`.
* `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30, with its value updated to the returned list from the function `func_1`.
* `x` is a list containing a single element 0.
* `inds` is a dictionary with a single key 0, which maps to a list containing a single element 0.

Note that the function `func_1` and `func_2` are not defined in the given code snippet, so their behavior and return values are unknown. However, based on the given information, we can conclude that `n`, `q`, and `a` are updated to new values, while `x` and `inds` are initialized with new values.
