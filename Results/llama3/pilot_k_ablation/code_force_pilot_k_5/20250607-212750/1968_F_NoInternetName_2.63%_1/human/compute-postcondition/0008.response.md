Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 4 elements, x is a list containing five elements: 0, the next element in a, the result of the XOR operation between the next element in a and the index i, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, inds is a dictionary with four keys: 0, which maps to a list containing three elements 0, the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the index of the last element in x, the previous element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 1, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 2, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 3, and the last element in x, which maps to a list containing a single element 4**

The code executes two lines. The first line appends the result of the XOR operation between the last element in `x` and the index `i` to `x`. The second line appends the index of the last element in `x` to the list of indices in the `inds` dictionary that corresponds to the last element in `x`. The values of `n` and `q` are not affected by the code. The list `a` remains unchanged. The list `x` now contains five elements, including the result of the XOR operation between the last element in `x` and the index `i`. The dictionary `inds` now contains an additional key-value pair, where the key is the last element in `x` and the value is a list containing a single element, which is the index of the last element in `x`.
