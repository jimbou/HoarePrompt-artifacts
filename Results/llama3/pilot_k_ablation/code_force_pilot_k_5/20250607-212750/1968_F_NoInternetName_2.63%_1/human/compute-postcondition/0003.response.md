To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of list `a`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `a`. If `a` has at least one more element, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `a` has at least 1 element, and `i` is the last element processed.

For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least one more element, and `i` must be the next element in the list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is a list containing two elements: 0 and the next element in `a`, `inds` is a dictionary with two keys: 0, which maps to a list containing a single element 0, and the next element in `a`, which maps to a list containing a single element 1**
