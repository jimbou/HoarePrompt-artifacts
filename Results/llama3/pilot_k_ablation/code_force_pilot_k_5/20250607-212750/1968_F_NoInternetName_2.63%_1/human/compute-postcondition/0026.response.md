Postcondition: **n is a positive integer, q is greater than 0, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 0, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[r] and the index lower + 1, upper is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[l - 1] and the index upper. If the current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower, and the current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of upper, which is less than or equal to the current value of r, and the current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of lower, which is less than or equal to the current value of r, then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, either upper is less than or equal to lower, or upper is less than l, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than l, or lower is greater than r, and 'No' is printed.**
