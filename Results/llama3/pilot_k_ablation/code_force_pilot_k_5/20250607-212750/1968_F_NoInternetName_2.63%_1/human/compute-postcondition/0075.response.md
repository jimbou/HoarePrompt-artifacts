Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is 0, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is q, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is the same as the output state after the loop executes 5 times, with the only difference being that the value of q is now 0, indicating that the loop has finished executing. The values of n, a, x, inds, l, r, lower, and upper remain unchanged. The loop has finished executing, and the final state is the same as the state after the 5th iteration.
