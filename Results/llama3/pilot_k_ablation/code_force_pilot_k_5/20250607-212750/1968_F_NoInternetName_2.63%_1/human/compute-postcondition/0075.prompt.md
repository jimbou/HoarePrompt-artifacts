Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(q):
    l, r = func_1(int)
    if x[l - 1] == x[r]:
        print('Yes')
        continue
    lower = func_2(inds[x[r]], lambda arg: arg < l) or -1
    upper = func_2(inds[x[l - 1]], lambda arg: arg <= r)
    lower = inds[x[r]][lower + 1]
    upper = inds[x[l - 1]][upper]
    if upper > lower and l <= upper <= r and l <= lower <= r:
        print('Yes')
    else:
        print('No')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 0, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 0, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[r] and the index lower + 1, upper is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[l - 1] and the index upper. If the current value of upper is greater than the current value of lower, and the current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of upper, which is less than or equal to the current value of r, and the current value of l is less than or equal to the current value of lower, which is less than or equal to the current value of r, then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, either upper is less than or equal to lower, or upper is less than l, or upper is greater than r, or lower is less than l, or lower is greater than r, and 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 1, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 1, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[r] and the index lower + 1, upper is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[l - 1] and the index upper, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 2, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 2, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[r] and the index lower + 1, upper is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[l - 1] and the index upper, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 2, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 3, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is a positive integer, q is greater than 3, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 4, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]]. If upper is greater than lower and l is less than or equal to upper which is less than or equal to r and (l is less than or equal to lower which is less than or equal to r), then 'Yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'No' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
