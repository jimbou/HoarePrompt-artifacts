Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, `inds` is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop and moves to the next iteration. The values of the variables `n`, `q`, `a`, `x`, `inds`, `i`, `l`, and `r` remain unchanged. The condition `x[l - 1] == x[r]` is still true, and 'Yes' is still printed. The loop continues to the next iteration, and the program execution proceeds.
