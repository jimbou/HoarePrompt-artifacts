Functionality: **This function determines whether there exists a subarray within a given array that satisfies a specific XOR condition. It takes no explicit parameters but uses the values of n, q, a, func_1, and func_2 from the external program state. The function iterates over q queries, each specifying a range [l, r] within the array. For each query, it checks if the XOR of all elements in the range [l, r] is equal to the XOR of all elements in the range [0, l-1]. If the XOR values are equal, it prints 'Yes'. Otherwise, it searches for the nearest indices within the range [l, r] that have the same XOR value as the range [0, l-1] and [0, r], respectively. If such indices exist and are within the specified range, it prints 'Yes'; otherwise, it prints 'No'. The function modifies the external program state by printing 'Yes' or 'No' for each query and leaving the values of n, q, a, x, inds, i, l, r, lower, and upper in a specific state after execution.**
