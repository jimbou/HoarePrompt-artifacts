Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `q` is greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, `inds` is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, `i` is 0, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`. The current value of `x[l - 1]` is equal to the current value of `x[r]`***
