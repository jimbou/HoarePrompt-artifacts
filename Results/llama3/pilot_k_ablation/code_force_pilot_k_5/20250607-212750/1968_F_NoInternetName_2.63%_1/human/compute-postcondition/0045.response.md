Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is greater than 2, a is an empty list, x is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, inds is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in a and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, i is 2, l and r are returned values from func_1(int), lower is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[r] and the index lower + 1, upper is the index of the result of the XOR operation between x[l - 1] and the index upper, lower is the value at index lower + 1 in the list inds[x[r]], upper is the value at index upper in the list inds[x[l - 1]].**

The code snippet modifies the values of `lower` and `upper` by applying the `func_2` function to the lists `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]` respectively, with lambda functions as arguments. The `func_2` function returns the index of the first element in the list that satisfies the condition specified by the lambda function. If no such element is found, it returns -1. The `lower` and `upper` variables are then updated to the values at the indices returned by `func_2` plus one, in the lists `inds[x[r]]` and `inds[x[l - 1]]` respectively. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
