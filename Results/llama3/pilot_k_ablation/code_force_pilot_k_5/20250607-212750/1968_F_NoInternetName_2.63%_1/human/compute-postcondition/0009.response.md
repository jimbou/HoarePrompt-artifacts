To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we are iterating over the elements of list `a`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:

* `n` is a positive integer
* `q` is a positive integer
* `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 4 elements
* `x` is a list containing five elements: 0, the next element in `a`, the result of the XOR operation between the next element in `a` and the index `i`, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in `x` and the index `i`, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in `x` and the index `i`
* `inds` is a dictionary with four keys: 0, which maps to a list containing three elements 0, the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the index of the last element in `x`, the previous element in `a`, which maps to a list containing a single element 1, the next element in `a`, which maps to a list containing a single element 2, the next element in `a`, which maps to a list containing a single element 3, and the last element in `x`, which maps to a list containing a single element 4

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes when the loop iterates over the next element in `a`.

* `i` will take on the value of the next element in `a`.
* `x` will be updated to reflect the new values of the XOR operations.
* `inds` will be updated to reflect the new indices of the elements in `x`.

The other variables `n`, `q`, and `a` do not change.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 4 elements, `x` is a list containing five elements: 0, the next element in `a`, the result of the XOR operation between the next element in `a` and the index `i`, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in `x` and the index `i`, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in `x` and the index `i`, `inds` is a dictionary with four keys: 0, which maps to a list containing three elements 0, the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the index of the last element in `x`, the previous element in `a`, which maps to a list containing a single element 1, the next element in `a`, which maps to a list containing a single element 2, the next element in `a`, which maps to a list containing a single element 3, and the last element in `x`, which maps to a list containing a single element 4, and `i` is the next element in `a`**
