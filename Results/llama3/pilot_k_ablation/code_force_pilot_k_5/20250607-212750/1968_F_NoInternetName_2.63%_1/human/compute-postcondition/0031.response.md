Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is greater than 1, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, `inds` is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[r]` and the index `lower + 1`, `upper` is the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[l - 1]` and the index `upper`, 'Yes' is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of all variables remain unchanged, and 'Yes' is still printed.
