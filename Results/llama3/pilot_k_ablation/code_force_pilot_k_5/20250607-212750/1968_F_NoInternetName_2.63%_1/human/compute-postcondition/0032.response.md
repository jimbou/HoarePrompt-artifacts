Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `q` is greater than 1, `a` is an empty list, `x` is a list containing 2^30 elements: 0 and the result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, `inds` is a dictionary with 2^30 keys: each key is a unique result of the XOR operation between each element in `a` and the index `i`, which maps to a list containing a single element, the index of the result of the XOR operation, `i` is 1, `l` and `r` are returned values from `func_1(int)`, `lower` is the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[r]` and the index `lower + 1`, `upper` is the index of the result of the XOR operation between `x[l - 1]` and the index `upper`. If `x[l - 1]` is equal to `x[r]`, 'Yes' is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
