Output State: **n is a positive integer, q is a positive integer, a is a list of non-negative integers less than 2^30 that must have at least 4 elements, x is a list containing six elements: 0, the next element in a, the result of the XOR operation between the next element in a and the index i, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, inds is a dictionary with five keys: 0, which maps to a list containing three elements 0, the index of the result of the XOR operation, and the index of the last element in x, the previous element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 1, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 2, the next element in a, which maps to a list containing a single element 3, the last element in x, which maps to a list containing a single element 4, and the result of the XOR operation between the last element in x and the index i, which maps to a list containing a single element 5, and i is the next element in a**
