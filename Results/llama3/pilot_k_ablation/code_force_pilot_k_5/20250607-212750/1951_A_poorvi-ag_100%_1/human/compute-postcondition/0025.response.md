Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is either 0 or even and not equal to 2 or '11' is not in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the strings 'yes' and 'yes'.**

In natural language, the output state means that the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `count_ones` is either 0 or even and not equal to 2 or '11' is not in `arr`, which is a condition that was already present in the initial state. The only change is that the list `results` now contains an additional string 'yes', making it a list containing two 'yes' strings.
