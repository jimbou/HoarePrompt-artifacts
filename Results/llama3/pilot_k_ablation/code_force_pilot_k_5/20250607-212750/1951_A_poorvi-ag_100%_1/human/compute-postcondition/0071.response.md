The only variable in the loop head is variable  r, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the results.  If the list has at least 3 strings the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, results has at least 2 strings, r is the second string in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 strings and the r is the third string in the list.
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 3 strings, `r` is the third string in the list**
