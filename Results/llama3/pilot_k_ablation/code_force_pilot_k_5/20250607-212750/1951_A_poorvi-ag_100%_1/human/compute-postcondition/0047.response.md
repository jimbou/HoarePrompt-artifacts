Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is 3, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `results` is a list containing three strings: two initial strings and 'yes', stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `_`, and `count_ones` remain unchanged. The only change is in the `results` list, which now contains three strings: the two initial strings and the newly appended string 'yes'. The stdin remains empty.
