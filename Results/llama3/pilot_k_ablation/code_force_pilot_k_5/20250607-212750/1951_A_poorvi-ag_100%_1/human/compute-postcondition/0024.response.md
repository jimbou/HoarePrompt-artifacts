Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `results` is a list containing the strings 'yes' and 'no' if `count_ones` is 0, or a list containing the strings 'no' and 'no' if `count_ones` is greater than 0, stdin contains -1 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `results` is updated by appending the string 'no' to the list. The condition for `count_ones` is still valid, and the value of `results` depends on the value of `count_ones`. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains the strings 'yes' and 'no'. If `count_ones` is greater than 0, `results` contains the strings 'no' and 'no'. The stdin still contains -1 inputs.
