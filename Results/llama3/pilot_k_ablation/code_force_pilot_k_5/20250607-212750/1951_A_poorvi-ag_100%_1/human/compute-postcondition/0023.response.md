Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `results` is a list containing the strings 'yes' and 'no', stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is 0, then the last element of `results` is 'no'. If `count_ones` is greater than 0, then if `count_ones` is odd, the last element of `results` is 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, then if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, the last element of `results` is 'no'. Otherwise, the last element of `results` is 'no'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The list `results` now contains an additional element 'no' at the end. The condition for `results` is updated such that if `count_ones` is 0, the last element of `results` is 'no'. If `count_ones` is greater than 0, the last element of `results` is 'no' regardless of whether `count_ones` is odd or even, or whether '11' is in `arr`. The stdin still contains -1 inputs.
