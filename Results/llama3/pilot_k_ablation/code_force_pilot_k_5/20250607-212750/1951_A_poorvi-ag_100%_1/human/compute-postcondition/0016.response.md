Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer greater than 0 and is even, `_` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, and `count_ones` is not equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The list `results` now contains the string 'yes'. The conditions that `t` is greater than 0, `count_ones` is greater than 0 and even, and `count_ones` is not equal to 2 still hold. The stdin still contains no inputs.
