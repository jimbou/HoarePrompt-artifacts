Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than initially.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = input()
    count_ones = arr.count('1')
    if count_ones == 0:
        results.append('yes')
    elif count_ones % 2 != 0:
        results.append('no')
    elif count_ones == 2:
        if '11' in arr:
            results.append('no')
        else:
            results.append('yes')
    else:
        results.append('yes')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs. If `count_ones` is 0, then `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'. If `count_ones` is greater than 0, then if `count_ones` is odd, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. If `count_ones` is even, then if `count_ones` is 2 and '11' is in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, _ is 1, stdin contains -1 inputs. If count_ones is 0, then results is a list containing the string 'yes'. If count_ones is greater than 0, then if count_ones is odd, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If count_ones is even, then if count_ones is 2 and '11' is in arr, results is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'yes'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains -2 inputs. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains two strings. If `count_ones` is odd, the second string in `results` is 'no' and stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is even, stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is 2, the second string in `results` is 'yes' if '11' is not in `arr`, otherwise it is 'no'. If `count_ones` is even but not 2, the second string in `results` is not updated.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 3, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, _ is 3, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1's in arr, stdin is empty. If count_ones is 0, results is a list containing three strings: the first two strings are the same as before, and the third string is 'yes'. If count_ones is not 0, results is a list containing three strings: two initial strings and 'yes' if '11' is not in arr and count_ones is even, otherwise results contains three strings.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 4, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, _ is 4, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1's in arr, stdin is empty, results is a list containing four strings. If count_ones is 0, the last string in results is 'yes'. If count_ones is not 0, if count_ones is odd, the last string in results is 'no'. If count_ones is even, the last string in results is 'yes' if count_ones is not 2 or '11' is not in arr, otherwise the last string in results is 'no'.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
