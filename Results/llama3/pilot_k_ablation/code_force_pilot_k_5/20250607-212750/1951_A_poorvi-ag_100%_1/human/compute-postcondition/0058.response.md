Output State: **start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 4, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, _ is 4, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1's in arr, stdin is empty, results is a list containing four strings, where the last string is 'yes'**

In this output state, the values of start, end, t, n, arr, _, and count_ones remain unchanged. The only change is in the results list, which now contains four strings instead of three, with the last string being 'yes'.
