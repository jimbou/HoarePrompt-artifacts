Postcondition: ***start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 3, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, _ is 3, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1's in arr, results is a list containing three strings, stdin is empty. If count_ones is 2 and '11' is in arr, the results list contains three strings. If count_ones is 2 and '11' is not in arr, the results list contains three strings: two initial strings and 'yes'. If count_ones is not 2, the first two strings in results are the same as before and the third string is 'yes'.***
