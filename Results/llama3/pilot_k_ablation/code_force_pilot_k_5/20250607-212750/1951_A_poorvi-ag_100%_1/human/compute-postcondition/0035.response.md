Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing two strings: the first string is the original string in `results` and the second string is 'no', stdin contains -1 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `_`, and `count_ones` remain unchanged. The `results` list now contains two strings: the original string it had before and the new string 'no' that was appended to it. The stdin now contains one less input than before.
