Postcondition: ***start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 1, n is an integer, arr is a string, _ is 1, stdin contains -1 inputs. If count_ones is 0, then results is a list containing the string 'yes'. If count_ones is greater than 0, then if count_ones is odd, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If count_ones is even, then if count_ones is 2 and '11' is in arr, results is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'yes'.***
