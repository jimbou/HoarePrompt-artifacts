Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an integer greater than 0 and is even, and the current value of `count_ones` is 2, `_` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs, and '11' is not in `arr`.**

The code appends the string 'yes' to the `results` list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The `results` list, which was initially empty, now contains the string 'yes'. All other conditions and values remain the same as in the initial state.
