Output State: **start and end are integers such that start <= end, t is an integer, results is an empty list, stdin contains 1 less input than initially.**

The first line of the code assigns the integer value of the input to `t`. Since `t` was not previously defined, it is now an integer. The second line initializes an empty list called `results`. No other variables are affected. The values of `start` and `end` remain unchanged, and the relationship between them remains valid. Stdin now contains one less input than initially.
