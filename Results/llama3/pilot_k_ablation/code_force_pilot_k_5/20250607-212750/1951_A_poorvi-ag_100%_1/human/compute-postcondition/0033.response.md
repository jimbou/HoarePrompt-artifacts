The code `results.append('yes')` adds the string 'yes' to the end of the list `results`. The initial state of `results` is a list containing a string, so after the code is executed, `results` will be a list containing two strings.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains -2 inputs.**
