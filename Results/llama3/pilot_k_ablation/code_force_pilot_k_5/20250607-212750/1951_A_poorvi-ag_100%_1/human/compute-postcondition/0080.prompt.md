Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: start is an integer, end is an integer, t is 0, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, _ is t, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1's in arr, stdin is empty, results is a list containing t strings. If count_ones is 0, all strings in results are 'yes'. If count_ones is not 0, if count_ones is odd, all strings in results are 'no'. If count_ones is even, all strings in results are 'yes' if count_ones is not 2 or '11' is not in arr, otherwise all strings in results are 'no'.
Code of the loop:
for r in results:
    print(r)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 1 string, `r` is the first string in the list, and the first string in the list which is `r` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 2 strings, `r` is the second string in the list, and the second string in the list `results` which is `r` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 3 strings, `r` is the third string in the list, and the third string in the list which is r is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 4 strings, `r` is the fourth string in the list, and the fourth string in the list which is [r] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 5 strings, `r` is the fifth string in the list, and the fifth string in the list which is r is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
