Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 0, `results` is a list containing the string 'no', `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `count_ones` is an odd integer greater than 0, `_` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the only change is that the `results` list now contains the string 'no'. All other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains 0 inputs.
