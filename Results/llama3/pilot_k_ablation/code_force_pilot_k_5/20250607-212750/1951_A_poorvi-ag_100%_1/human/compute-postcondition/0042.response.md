The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `_` is increased by 1 so `_` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 3, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing two strings, stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is 0, `results` contains two strings. If `count_ones` is odd, the second string in `results` is 'no' and stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is even, stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is 2, the second string in `results` is 'yes' if '11' is not in `arr`, otherwise it is 'no'. If `count_ones` is even but not 2, the second string in `results` is not updated.**
