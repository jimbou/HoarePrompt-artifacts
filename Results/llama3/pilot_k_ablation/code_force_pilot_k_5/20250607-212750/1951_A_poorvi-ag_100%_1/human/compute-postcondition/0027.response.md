Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is either 0 or an even integer greater than 2 or an even integer equal to 2 and '11' is not in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the string 'yes' and 'yes'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `count_ones` is either 0 or an even integer greater than 2 or an even integer equal to 2 and '11' is not in `arr`. The `results` list now contains two strings: 'yes'.
