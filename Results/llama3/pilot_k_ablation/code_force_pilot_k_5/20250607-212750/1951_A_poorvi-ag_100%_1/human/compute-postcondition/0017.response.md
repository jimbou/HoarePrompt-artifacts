Postcondition: ***start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 0, n is an integer, arr is a string, count_ones is an integer greater than 0 and is even, _ is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs. If count_ones is 2, then if '11' is in arr, results is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'yes'. If count_ones is not equal to 2, then results is a list containing the string 'yes'.***
