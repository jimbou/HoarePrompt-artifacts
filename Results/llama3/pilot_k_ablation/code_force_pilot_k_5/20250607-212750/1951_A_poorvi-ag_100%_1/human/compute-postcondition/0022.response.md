Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 1, `count_ones` is either 0 or even and not equal to 2 or '11' is not in `arr`, `results` is a list containing the strings 'yes' and 'yes'.**

In this output state, the values of `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, and `_` remain unchanged. The value of `count_ones` is either 0 or even and not equal to 2 or '11' is not in `arr`, because if `count_ones` is odd or equal to 2 and '11' is in `arr`, the list `results` would contain the string 'no', but in this output state, it contains the string 'yes'. The list `results` now contains two strings 'yes' because the code `results.append('yes')` adds a new string 'yes' to the list.
