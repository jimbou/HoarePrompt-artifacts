To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects within it.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `_`, which is the loop counter, and `t`, which is the upper limit of the loop.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 3, and `t` is an integer greater than 3.

For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must remain greater than the new value of `_`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 4
* `t` is an integer greater than 4

The other variables, such as `start`, `end`, `n`, `arr`, `count_ones`, `results`, and `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is 4, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing three strings**
