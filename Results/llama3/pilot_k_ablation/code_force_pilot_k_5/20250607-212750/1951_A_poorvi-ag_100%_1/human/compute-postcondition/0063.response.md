Postcondition: ***start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 4, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, _ is 4, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1's in arr, stdin is empty, results is a list containing four strings. If count_ones is 0, the last string in results is 'yes'. If count_ones is not 0, if count_ones is odd, the last string in results is 'no'. If count_ones is even, the last string in results is 'yes' if count_ones is not 2 or '11' is not in arr, otherwise the last string in results is 'no'.***
