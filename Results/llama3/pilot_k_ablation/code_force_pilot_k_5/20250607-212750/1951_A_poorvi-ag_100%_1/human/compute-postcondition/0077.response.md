To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for r in results:`.

From the given state at the end of the previous iteration, we know that `r` is the fourth string in the list `results`, and it is being printed. To execute the loop again, we need to move to the next element in the list `results`.

The only object in the loop head that needs to be adjusted is `r`. Since `r` is currently the fourth string in the list, for the loop to execute again, `r` should be the fifth string in the list. Additionally, since the list `results` contains at least 4 strings, for the loop to execute again, the list `results` must contain at least 5 strings.

The other variables in the state, such as `start`, `end`, `t`, `n`, `arr`, `_`, `count_ones`, `stdin`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is 0, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is `t`, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `results` is a list containing at least 5 strings, `r` is the fifth string in the list**
