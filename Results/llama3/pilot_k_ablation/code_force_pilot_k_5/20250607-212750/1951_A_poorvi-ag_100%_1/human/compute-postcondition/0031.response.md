The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 2.
State: **start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 2, n is an integer, arr is a string, _ is 2, stdin contains -1 inputs. If count_ones is 0, then results is a list containing the string 'yes'. If count_ones is greater than 0, then if count_ones is odd, results is a list containing the string 'no'. If count_ones is even, then if count_ones is 2 and '11' is in arr, results is a list containing the string 'no'. Otherwise, results is a list containing the string 'yes'.**
