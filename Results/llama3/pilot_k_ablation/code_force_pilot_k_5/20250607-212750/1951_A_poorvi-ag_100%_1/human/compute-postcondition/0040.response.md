Postcondition: ***`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a string, `_` is 2, `count_ones` is an integer, `results` is a list containing two strings. If `count_ones` is odd, the second string in `results` is 'no' and stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is even, stdin contains -1 inputs. If `count_ones` is 2, the second string in `results` is 'yes' if '11' is not in `arr`, otherwise it is 'no'. If `count_ones` is even but not 2, the second string in `results` is not updated.***
