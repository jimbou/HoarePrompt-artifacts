Postcondition: ***start is an integer, end is an integer, t is an integer greater than 3, n is an integer equal to the first input, arr is a string equal to the second input, _ is 3, count_ones is an integer equal to the number of '1's in arr, stdin is empty. If count_ones is odd, results is a list containing three strings. If count_ones is even, results is a list containing three strings: two initial strings and 'yes' if '11' is not in arr, otherwise results contains three strings. ***
