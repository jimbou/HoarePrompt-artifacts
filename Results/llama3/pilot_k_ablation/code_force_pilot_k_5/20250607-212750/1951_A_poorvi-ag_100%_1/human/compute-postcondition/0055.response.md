Output State: **`start` is an integer, `end` is an integer, `t` is an integer greater than 4, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `arr` is a string equal to the second input, `_` is 4, `count_ones` is an integer equal to the number of '1's in `arr`, `results` is a list containing four strings, the last string is 'yes'**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values except for `results`, which now contains four strings instead of three, with the last string being 'yes'. The stdin remains empty.
