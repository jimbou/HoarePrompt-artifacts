Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, l is an empty list, c is 0, maxi is the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays in the list, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `l` will be empty because the loop iterates over each element in the list. The variable `c` will be reset to 0 because whenever a negative element is encountered and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, `c` is reset to 0. The variable `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays in the list because it keeps track of the maximum value between the current sum `c` and the previous maximum sum `maxi`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop.
