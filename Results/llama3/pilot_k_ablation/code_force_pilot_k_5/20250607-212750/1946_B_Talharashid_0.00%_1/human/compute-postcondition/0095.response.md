Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between its original value and `c`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the second element in the list.***
