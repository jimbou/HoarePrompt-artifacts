Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is an empty list, c is 0, maxi is the maximum sum of subarray in the list, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `l` is empty, the variable `c` is reset to 0, and the variable `maxi` holds the maximum sum of subarray in the list. The other variables `n`, `k`, `i`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
