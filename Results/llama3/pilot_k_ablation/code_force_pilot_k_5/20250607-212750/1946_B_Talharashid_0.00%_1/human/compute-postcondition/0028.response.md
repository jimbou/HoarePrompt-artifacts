The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the number of test cases. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and there are multiple test cases minus 2 inputs left in stdin. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and there must be multiple test cases minus 3 inputs left in stdin.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 3 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, and this is printed: (2**
