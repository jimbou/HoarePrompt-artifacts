To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the integer input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

The integer input from `stdin` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. Since we don't know the exact value of the input, we can only say that it must be greater than 1.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi` are not affected by the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of subarray in the list, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input: a list of integers, and this is printed: (1**
