Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the first integer in `l`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original `maxi` and the original `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of the first integer in `l` and 0, and `maxi` is 0. In all cases, `i` is 2.***
