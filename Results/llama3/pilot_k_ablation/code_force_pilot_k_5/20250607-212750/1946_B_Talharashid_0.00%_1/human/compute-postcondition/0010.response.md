Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list, `c` is either the previous value of `c` plus the second element in the list or the previous value of `c` plus a negative number, `maxi` is either the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi` or 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated by adding the value of `ele`, which is the second element in the list `l`. The value of `maxi` remains unchanged if `ele` is not less than 0 or if `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`. Otherwise, `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`. The values of the other variables, including `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and the contents of stdin, remain unchanged.
