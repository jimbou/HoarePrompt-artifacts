Output State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 0, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum sum of subarray in the list, `i` is the number of test cases, stdin is empty, and the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is printed for each test case.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the loop will have processed all the test cases in the input. The variables `n` and `k` will be 0, the list `l` will be empty, the variable `c` will be 0, and the variable `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of subarray in the list. The variable `i` will be equal to the number of test cases. The input stream `stdin` will be empty, and the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` will have been printed for each test case.
