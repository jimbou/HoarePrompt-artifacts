Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, i is 3. If the third integer in l is negative and its absolute value is less than or equal to c, then maxi is the maximum of its original value and c, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the third integer in l. stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.***
