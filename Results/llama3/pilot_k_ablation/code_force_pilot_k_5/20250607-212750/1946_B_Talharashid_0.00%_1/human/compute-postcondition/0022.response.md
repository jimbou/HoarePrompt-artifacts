Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the fifth element in the list, `c` is either incremented by the value of `ele` if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, or `c` is 0 if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, and `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i` remains the same. The value of `c` is updated based on the value of `ele`. If `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.
