Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position in the list `l` that does not contain a negative number greater than the sum of the subarray, `i` is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an empty list, and this is printed: (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 which is equal to (2 ** k * c - c) % 1000000007**
