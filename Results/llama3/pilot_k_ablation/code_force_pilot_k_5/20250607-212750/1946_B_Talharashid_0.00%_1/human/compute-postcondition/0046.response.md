Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and `c`, and `c` is either 0 or increased by the third element in the list**

The value of `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`. Since `l` has at least 4 elements, the third element exists. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `stdin`, and `maxi` are not affected by the code. The new value of `c` is either 0 (if it was 0 before) or increased by the third element in the list `l`.
