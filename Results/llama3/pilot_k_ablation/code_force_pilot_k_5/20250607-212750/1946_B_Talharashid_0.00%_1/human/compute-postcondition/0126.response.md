Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`, which is denoted as `ele`. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
