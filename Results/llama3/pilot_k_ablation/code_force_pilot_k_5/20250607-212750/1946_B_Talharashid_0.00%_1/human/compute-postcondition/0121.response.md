Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the second element in the list, c is 0, maxi is the maximum value between the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and 0.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `c` is either 0 or the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and `maxi` is initially 0, `maxi` will be either 0 or the maximum value between the second element in the list and 0. The second line assigns 0 to `c`. 

No other variables are affected by the code snippet. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `ele` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `stdin` also remains the same, as it is not modified by the code snippet.
