Output: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays in the list, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` which is equivalent to `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi) % 1000000007` since `sum(l)` is 0 because `l` is an empty list**
