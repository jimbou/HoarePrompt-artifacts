Postcondition: ***n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is either 0 or the sum of the first element in the list and 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, ele is the first element in the list. If ele is negative and the absolute value of ele is greater than or equal to 0, then c is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of the first element in the list and 0.***
