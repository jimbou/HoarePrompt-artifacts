To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`. The loop will execute if `l` has at least one element. Since `i` is 2, it indicates that the first two lines of stdin have already been processed, and `l` contains integers from the second line. For the loop to execute, `l` must have at least one integer.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the first integer in `l`**
