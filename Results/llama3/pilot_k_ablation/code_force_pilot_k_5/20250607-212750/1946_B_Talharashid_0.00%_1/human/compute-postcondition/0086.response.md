According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0 and `maxi` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element and `ele` is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list**
