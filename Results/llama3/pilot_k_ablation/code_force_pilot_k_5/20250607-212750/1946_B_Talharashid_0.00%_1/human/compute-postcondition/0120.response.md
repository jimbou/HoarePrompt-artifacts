To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `l` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `l` has at least 1 element, and `ele` is the first element in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `ele` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the second element in the list. If the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is 0 and maxi is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and maxi is 0.**
