The code `c += ele` increments the value of `c` by the value of `ele`. In the initial state, `ele` is the third element in the list `l`. So, the value of `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the third element in the list, `c` is increased by the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.**
