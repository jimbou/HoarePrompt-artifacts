Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and 0, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and `c`, and `c` is either 0 or increased by the third element in the list.***
