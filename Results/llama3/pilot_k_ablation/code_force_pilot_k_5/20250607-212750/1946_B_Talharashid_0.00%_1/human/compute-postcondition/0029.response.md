Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers**.

The code snippet reads two integers from stdin and assigns them to `n` and `k`, respectively. It then reads a list of integers from stdin and assigns it to `l`. The variables `c` and `maxi` are reset to 0. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 1. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.
