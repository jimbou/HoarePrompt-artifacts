Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, ele is the second integer in l, maxi is the maximum of the original c and the original maxi, c is 0, i is 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `stdin`, `ele`, and `i` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code snippet. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the original value of `c`, and the value of `c` is reset to 0.
