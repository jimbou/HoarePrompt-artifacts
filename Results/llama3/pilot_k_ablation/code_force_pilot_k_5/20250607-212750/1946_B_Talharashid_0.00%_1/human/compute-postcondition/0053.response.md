Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of subarray in the list, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.**

The code updates the value of `maxi` to be the maximum of its current value and `c`, which is 0. Since `maxi` is initially the maximum sum of subarray in the list, its new value will be the maximum of 0 and this initial value. The other variables remain unchanged.
