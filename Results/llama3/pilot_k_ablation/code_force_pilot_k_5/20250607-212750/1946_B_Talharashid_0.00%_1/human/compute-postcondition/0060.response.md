Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, c is 0, maxi is the maximum of the original maxi and the original c, i is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, ele is the first integer in l, the current value of ele is less than 0 and the current value of maxi is greater than or equal to the absolute value of ele.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and `ele` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is reset to 0. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the original value of `c`. The condition that the current value of `ele` is less than 0 still holds, and the condition that the current value of `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele` is replaced by the condition that the current value of `maxi` is greater than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`.
