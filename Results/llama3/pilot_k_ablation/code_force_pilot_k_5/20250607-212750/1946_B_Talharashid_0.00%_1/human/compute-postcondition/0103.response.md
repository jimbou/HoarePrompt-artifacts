Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `ele` is the fourth element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the fourth element in the list.***
