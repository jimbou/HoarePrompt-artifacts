To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for ele in l:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `ele` and `l`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` is the first element in the list `l`, and `l` must have at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 2 elements, and `ele` should be the second element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list.**
