Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and 0, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and `c`, and `c` is either 0 or increased by the fifth element in the list, and `c` is increased by `ele`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is increased by `ele`. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and 0, and `c` is reset to 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and `c`, and `c` is either reset to 0 or increased by the fifth element in the list.
