Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative integers in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of all previous integers in the list, `maxi` is the maximum of the original `maxi` and `c`, `i` is the number of integers in the original list `l` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its original value and `c`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.
