Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is larger than the absolute value of `ele`***
