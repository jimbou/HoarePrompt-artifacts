Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is either 0 or the sum of the first element in the list and 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, ele is the first element in the list. If ele is negative and the absolute value of ele is greater than or equal to 0, then c is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of the first element in the list and 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is set to the maximum value between 0 and the sum of the second element in the list and 0. Otherwise, `c` is either the sum of the second element in the list and 0 or the sum of the second element in the list and the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and `maxi` remains 0. In both cases, `i` remains 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers. If the third element in the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the third element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 4 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and 0, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and `c`, and `c` is either 0 or increased by the third element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and 0, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `maxi` is the maximum of the original value and `c`, and `c` is either 0 or increased by the fifth element in the list, and `c` is increased by `ele`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
