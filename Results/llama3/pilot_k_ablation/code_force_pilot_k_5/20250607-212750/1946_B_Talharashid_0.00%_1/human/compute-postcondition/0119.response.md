Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the first element in the list. If the first element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is 0 and maxi is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of the first element in the list and 0, and maxi is 0.***
