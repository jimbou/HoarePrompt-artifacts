Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is an integer, `maxi` is the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position in the list `l` that does not contain a negative number greater than the sum of the subarray, `i` is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an empty list**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `l` is empty, indicating that all elements in the list have been processed. The variable `c` holds the sum of the subarray ending at the last position in the list, and `maxi` holds the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position in the list that does not contain a negative number greater than the sum of the subarray. The values of `n`, `k`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged.
