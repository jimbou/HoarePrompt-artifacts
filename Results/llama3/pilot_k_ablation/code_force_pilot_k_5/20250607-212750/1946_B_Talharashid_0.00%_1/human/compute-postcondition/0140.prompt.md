Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k (1 <= n, k <= 2 * 10^5). The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (-10^9 <= a_i <= 10^9). The sum of the values of n and k for all test cases does not exceed 2 * 10^5.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(int(input())):
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    l = list(map(int, input().split()))
    c = 0
    maxi = 0
    for ele in l:
        if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
            maxi = max(c, maxi)
            c = 0
        else:
            c += ele
    maxi = max(c, maxi)
    print((2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, and this is printed: (2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of subarray in the list, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, and this is printed: (2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative integers in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of all previous integers in the list, `maxi` is the maximum of the original `maxi` and `c`, `i` is the number of integers in the original list `l` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position in the list `l` that does not contain a negative number greater than the sum of the subarray, `i` is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an empty list, and this is printed: (2

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays in the list, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
