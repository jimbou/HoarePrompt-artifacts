The only variable in the loop head is variable  ele, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list, `i` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the `ele` is the second element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is either 0 plus the first element in the list or the previous value of `c` plus the first element in the list, and `maxi` is 0.**
