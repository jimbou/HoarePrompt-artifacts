The code snippet updates the values of `maxi` and `c`. The first line assigns the maximum value between `c` and `maxi` to `maxi`. Since `c` is either 0 or the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and `maxi` is 0, `maxi` becomes the maximum value between 0 and the sum of the second element in the list and 0. The second line assigns 0 to `c`.

Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, c is 0, maxi is the maximum value between 0 and the sum of the second element in the list and 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, ele is the second element in the list.**
