The code prints the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007`.

Here's a breakdown of the variables and their values:

*   `k` is an integer.
*   `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of subarray in the list. Since the list is empty, the maximum sum of subarray is 0, so `maxi` is 0.
*   `l` is an empty list, so `sum(l)` is 0.

Now, let's evaluate the expression:

*   `2 ** k` is 2 raised to the power of `k`, which is an integer.
*   `2 ** k * maxi` is 0 because `maxi` is 0.
*   `2 ** k * maxi - maxi` is 0 because both terms are 0.
*   `2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)` is 0 because `sum(l)` is 0.
*   `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` is 0 because the expression inside the parentheses is 0.

Output: **0**
