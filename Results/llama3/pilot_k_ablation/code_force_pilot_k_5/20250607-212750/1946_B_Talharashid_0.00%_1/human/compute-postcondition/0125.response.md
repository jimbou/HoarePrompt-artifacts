Output State: **n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the third element in the list, maxi is the maximum of its previous value and c, c is 0**

The code snippet modifies the values of `maxi` and `c`. The first line updates `maxi` to be the maximum of its previous value and `c`, but since `c` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it has some value. The second line resets `c` to 0. The values of `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, `stdin`, and `ele` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
