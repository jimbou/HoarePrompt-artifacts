Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`.***
