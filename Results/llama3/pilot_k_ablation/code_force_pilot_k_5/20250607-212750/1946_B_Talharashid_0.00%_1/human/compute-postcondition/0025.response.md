Let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is: `maxi = max(c, maxi)`

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `k` is an integer
- `l` is an empty list
- `c` is 0
- `maxi` is the maximum sum of subarray of `l` that ends with a negative number
- `i` is 0
- stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers

Now, let's think step by step:

- The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `c`.
- Since `c` is 0, `maxi` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and 0.
- The current value of `maxi` is the maximum sum of subarray of `l` that ends with a negative number. Since `l` is an empty list, there are no subarrays, so `maxi` is likely to be a very small number (possibly negative infinity or a very small negative number).
- Therefore, `maxi` will be updated to be 0, because 0 is greater than or equal to any negative number.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers**
