Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the first element in the list. If the first element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is 0 and maxi is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of the first element in the list and 0, and maxi is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the second element in the list. If the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is 0 and maxi is the maximum value between the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and 0. Otherwise, if the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is the second element in the list and maxi is 0. If the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is less than the current value of c, then c is the sum of the second element in the list and the previous value of c, and maxi is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the third element in the list `l`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `ele` is the fourth element in the list. If `ele` is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the fourth element in the list (`l[3]`).

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the fifth element in the list. If the fifth element in the list is negative and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of the fifth element, then maxi is the maximum of its original value and c, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the fifth element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
