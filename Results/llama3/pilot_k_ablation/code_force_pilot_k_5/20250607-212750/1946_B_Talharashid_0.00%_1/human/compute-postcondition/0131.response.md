Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `ele` is the fourth element in the list. If `ele` is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the fourth element in the list (`l[3]`).***
