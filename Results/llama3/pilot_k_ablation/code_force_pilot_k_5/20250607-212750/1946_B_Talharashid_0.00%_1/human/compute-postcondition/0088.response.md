Output State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, c is 0, maxi is the maximum value between the original value of c and the original value of maxi, ele is the first element in the list and is less than 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `l`, and `ele` remain unchanged because they are not modified by the code. The value of `c` is reset to 0. The value of `maxi` is updated to be the maximum value between its original value and the original value of `c`.
