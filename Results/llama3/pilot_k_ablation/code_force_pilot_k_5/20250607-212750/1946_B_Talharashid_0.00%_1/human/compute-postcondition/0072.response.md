The only variable in the loop head is variable  ele, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l. If the list has at least 4 integers the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 3 integers, i is 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 integers and ele is the fourth integer in l.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, i is 3, ele is the fourth integer in l**
