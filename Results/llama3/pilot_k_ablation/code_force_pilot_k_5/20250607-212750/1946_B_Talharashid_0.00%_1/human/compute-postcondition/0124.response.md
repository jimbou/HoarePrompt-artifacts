To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `ele` and `l`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in the list `l`. Since `ele` is the second element in the list, for the loop to execute again, `l` must have at least 3 elements.

At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 2 elements, and `ele` is the second element in the list. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` must have at least 3 elements, and `ele` must be the third element in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the third element in the list**
