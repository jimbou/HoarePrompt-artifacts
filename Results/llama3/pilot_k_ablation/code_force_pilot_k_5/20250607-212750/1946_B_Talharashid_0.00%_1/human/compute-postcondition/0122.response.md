Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the second element in the list. If the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is the second element in the list and maxi is 0. Otherwise, c is the sum of the second element in the list and the previous value of c, and maxi is 0.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated based on the value of `ele` (the second element in the list). If `ele` is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of `c`, then `c` is set to the value of `ele`. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
