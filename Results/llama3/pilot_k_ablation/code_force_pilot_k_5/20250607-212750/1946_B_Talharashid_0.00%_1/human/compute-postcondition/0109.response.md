Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position in the list `l` that does not contain a negative number greater than the sum of the subarray, `i` is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an empty list**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the value of `c`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, with an empty list.
