To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for ele in l:`, where `l` is a list of integers and `ele` is the element being iterated over.

At the end of the previous iteration, `ele` is the third element in the list, and we know that the list has at least 3 elements. To execute the loop again, we need to consider the next element in the list.

Since the loop iterates over the elements of the list `l`, the next element to be processed would be the fourth element in the list (assuming the list has at least 4 elements). Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `ele` to be the fourth element in the list.

The other variables in the state, such as `n`, `k`, `c`, and `maxi`, are not directly related to the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `ele` is the fourth element in the list.**
