Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative integers in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of all previous integers in the list, `maxi` is the maximum of the original `maxi` and `c`, `i` is the number of integers in the original list `l` plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` which is a value between 0 and 1000000006 (inclusive) that is the remainder of the division of `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l))` by 1000000007**
