To determine what will be printed when the given statement executes, let's break down the components of the expression and understand their values based on the initial state.

1. **`2 ** k`**: This is the result of raising 2 to the power of `k`. Since `k` is an integer equal to the second input, the exact value of `2 ** k` depends on the value of `k`.

2. **`maxi`**: This is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, there are no subarrays, and thus the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays is 0. Therefore, `maxi` is 0.

3. **`sum(l)`**: This is the sum of all elements in the list `l`. Since `l` is an empty list, `sum(l)` is 0.

Given these values, the expression `(2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007` simplifies as follows:

- `2 ** k * maxi` is `2 ** k * 0`, which equals 0.
- Subtracting `maxi` (which is 0) does not change the value.
- Adding `sum(l)` (which is 0) also does not change the value.

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to `0 % 1000000007`, which equals 0.

Output: **0**
