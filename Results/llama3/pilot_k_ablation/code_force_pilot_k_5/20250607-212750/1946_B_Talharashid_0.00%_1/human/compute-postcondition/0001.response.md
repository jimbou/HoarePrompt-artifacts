Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` are integers, and `n` is greater than 0. The list `l` contains a list of integers. The variables `c` and `maxi` are both initialized to 0. The variable `i` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.
