The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is less than the number of test cases, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the number of integers in the original list `l` plus 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and the number of test cases must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers, `c` is the sum of all non-negative integers in the original list `l` and the absolute values of all negative integers in the original list `l` that are greater than the sum of all previous integers in the list, `maxi` is the maximum of the original `maxi` and `c`, `i` is the number of integers in the original list `l` plus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: a list of integers, and this is printed: the result of the expression `(2**maxi) % (10**9 + 7)`**
