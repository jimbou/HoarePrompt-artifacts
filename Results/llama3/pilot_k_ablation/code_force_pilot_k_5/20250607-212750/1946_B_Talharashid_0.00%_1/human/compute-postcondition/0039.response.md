Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is set to 0 and `maxi` is set to the maximum value between 0 and the sum of the second element in the list and 0. Otherwise, `c` is either the sum of the second element in the list and 0 or the sum of the second element in the list and the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and `maxi` remains 0. In both cases, `i` remains 1.***
