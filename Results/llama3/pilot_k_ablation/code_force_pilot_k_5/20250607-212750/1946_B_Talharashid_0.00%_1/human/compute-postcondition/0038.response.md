Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `c` is either the sum of the second element in the list and 0 or the sum of the second element in the list and the sum of the second element in the list and 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the second element in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be either the sum of the second element in the list and 0 or the sum of the second element in the list and the sum of the second element in the list and 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
