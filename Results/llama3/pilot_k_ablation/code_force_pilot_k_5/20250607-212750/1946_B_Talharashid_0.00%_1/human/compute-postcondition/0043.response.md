Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers. If the third element in the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to `c`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its original value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the third element in the list.***
