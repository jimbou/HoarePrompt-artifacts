Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers, and this is printed: (2 ** k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007 which is equal to (2 ** k * 0 - 0 + sum([])) % 1000000007 which is equal to (2 ** k * 0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007 which is equal to (0 - 0 + 0) % 1000000007 which is equal to 0 % 1000000007 which is equal to 0**
