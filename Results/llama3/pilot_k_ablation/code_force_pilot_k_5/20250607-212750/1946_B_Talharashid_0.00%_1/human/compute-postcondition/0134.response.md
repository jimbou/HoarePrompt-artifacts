Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is 1, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, `ele` is the fifth element in the list, `c` is increased by the fifth element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated by adding the fifth element of the list `l` to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.
