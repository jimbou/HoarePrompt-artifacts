The only variable in the loop head is variable  ele, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `l` has at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `ele` is the third element in the list.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the third element in the list.**
