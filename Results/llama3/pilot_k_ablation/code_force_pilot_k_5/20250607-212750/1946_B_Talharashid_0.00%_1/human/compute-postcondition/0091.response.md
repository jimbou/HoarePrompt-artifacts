Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is equal to the sum of its initial value and the first element in the list, and `maxi` is 0.***
