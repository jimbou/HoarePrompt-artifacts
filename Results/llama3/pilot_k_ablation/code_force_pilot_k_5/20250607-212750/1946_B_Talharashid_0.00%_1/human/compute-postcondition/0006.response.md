Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is either 0 + the first element in the list or the previous value of `c` plus the first element in the list, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is larger than the absolute value of `ele`**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated by adding the value of `ele` (the first element in the list) to it. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. The condition that either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is larger than the absolute value of `ele` still holds true.
