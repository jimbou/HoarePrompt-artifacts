The only objects in the loop head are variables  ele and list  l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 5 elements the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 4 elements, ele is the fourth element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 elements and the ele is the fifth element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the fifth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`.**
