Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is either 0 plus the first element in the list or the previous value of `c` plus the first element in the list, and `maxi` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the second element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is either the previous value of `c` plus the second element in the list or the previous value of `c` plus a negative number, and `maxi` is either the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi` or 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the third element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of its previous value and `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the third element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is 0, `ele` is the fourth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is incremented by the value of `ele`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, i is 0, ele is the fifth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then maxi is the maximum value between c and maxi, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is incremented by the value of ele.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
