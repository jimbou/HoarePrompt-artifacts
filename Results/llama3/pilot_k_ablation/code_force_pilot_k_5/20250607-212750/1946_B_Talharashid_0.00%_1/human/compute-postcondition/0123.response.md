Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the second element in the list. If the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is 0 and maxi is the maximum value between the sum of the second element in the list and 0, and 0. Otherwise, if the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the current value of c, then c is the second element in the list and maxi is 0. If the second element of the list is negative and its absolute value is less than the current value of c, then c is the sum of the second element in the list and the previous value of c, and maxi is 0.***
