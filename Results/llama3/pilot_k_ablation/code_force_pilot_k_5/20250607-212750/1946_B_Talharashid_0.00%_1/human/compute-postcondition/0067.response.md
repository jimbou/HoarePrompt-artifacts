Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the second integer in `l`, `i` is 2. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum of the original `maxi` and the original `c`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is the sum of the original `c` and `ele`, and `maxi` is either the maximum of the original `maxi` and the original `c` if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, or 0 otherwise.***
