To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The only variable in the loop head is `i`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is not defined, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an empty list, and this is printed: `(2`.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `stdin` must contain at least one more input. Since `i` is not defined, we can assume it is 0 at the start of the first iteration. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 1.

The state of other variables (`n`, `k`, `l`, `c`, and `maxi`) is not affected by the loop head, so they remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is an empty list, `c` is an integer, `maxi` is the maximum of `c` and the maximum sum of subarray ending at each position in the list `l` that does not contain a negative number greater than the sum of the subarray, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 1 input**
