The only object in the loop head is variable `ele` and list `l`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `l`. If the list has at least 1 element the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 element and the ele is the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the first element in the list**
