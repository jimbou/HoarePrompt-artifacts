Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers, c is 0, maxi is 0, i is not defined, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers
Code of the loop:
for ele in l:
    if ele < 0 and c <= abs(ele):
        maxi = max(c, maxi)
        c = 0
    else:
        c += ele


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `ele` is the first element in the list. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`, and `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is equal to the sum of its initial value and the first element in the list, and `maxi` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `ele` is the second element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between its original value and `c`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `ele` is the third element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum of `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the value of the third element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `ele` is the fourth element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `c` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the fourth element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `ele` is the fifth element in the list. If `ele` is negative and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is updated to the maximum value between `c` and `maxi`, and `c` is set to 0. Otherwise, `c` is increased by the fifth element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
