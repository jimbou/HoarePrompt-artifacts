Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers, `l` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `c` is increased by the third element in the list, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers**

In this output state, the values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as integers. The list `l` still contains at least 3 elements. The variable `c` has been updated by adding the third element (`ele`) from the list `l` to its previous value. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.
