Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `c` is 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 2, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the first integer in `l`. Either `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is larger than the absolute value of `ele`***
