Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, l is an empty list, c is 0, maxi is the maximum sum of subarray of l that ends with a negative number, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `l` will be empty because the loop iterates over each element in the list. The variable `c` will be reset to 0 because it is reset to 0 whenever a negative number is encountered and the absolute value of the negative number is greater than or equal to `c`. The variable `maxi` will hold the maximum sum of subarray of `l` that ends with a negative number because it is updated whenever a negative number is encountered and the absolute value of the negative number is greater than or equal to `c`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the loop head and body. The stdin remains the same because it is not affected by the loop.
