Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, `ele` is the second integer in `l`, `i` is 2, `c` is the sum of the original `c` and `ele`, and `maxi` is either the maximum of the original `maxi` and the original `c` if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, or 0 otherwise.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of its original value and `ele`, which is the second integer in the list `l`. The value of `maxi` remains the same as its original value if `ele` is not less than 0 or `c` is greater than the absolute value of `ele`, but is updated to be the maximum of its original value and the original `c` if `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
