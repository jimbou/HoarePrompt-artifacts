Functionality: **This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains two integers n and k, and the second line contains n integers. The function calculates the maximum sum of a subarray in the list, then uses this value to compute a result based on the formula (2^k * maxi - maxi + sum(l)) % 1000000007, where maxi is the maximum sum of a subarray, and l is the list of integers. The function prints the result for each test case and continues until all test cases have been processed, leaving the input stream empty.**
