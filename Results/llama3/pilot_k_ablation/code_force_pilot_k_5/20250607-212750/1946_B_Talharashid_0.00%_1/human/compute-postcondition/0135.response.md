Postcondition: ***n is an integer equal to the first input, k is an integer equal to the second input, l is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, i is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the fifth element in the list. If the fifth element in the list is negative and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of the fifth element, then maxi is the maximum of its original value and c, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is increased by the fifth element in the list.***
