Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `ele` is the first element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If `ele` is less than 0 and `c` is less than or equal to the absolute value of `ele`, then `maxi` is the maximum value between the original value of `c` and the original value of `maxi`. Otherwise, `c` is either 0 plus the first element in the list or the previous value of `c` plus the first element in the list, and `maxi` is 0.***
