Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the sum of the first element in the list and 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers, Either the first element in the list is not less than 0 or the sum of the first element in the list and 0 is larger than the absolute value of the first element in the list**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of the first element in the list and 0. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers. The condition that either the first element in the list is not less than 0 or the sum of the first element in the list and 0 is larger than the absolute value of the first element in the list still holds.
