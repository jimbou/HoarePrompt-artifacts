Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is an empty list, `c` is 0, `maxi` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays in the list, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `maxi` has been updated to be the maximum of its previous value (the maximum sum of non-negative subarrays in the list) and 0 (the value of `c`). The other variables remain unchanged.
