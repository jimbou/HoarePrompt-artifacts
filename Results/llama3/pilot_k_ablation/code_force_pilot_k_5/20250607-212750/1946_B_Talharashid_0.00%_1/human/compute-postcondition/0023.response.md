Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, i is 0, ele is the fifth element in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: two integers and a list of integers. If ele is less than 0 and c is less than or equal to the absolute value of ele, then maxi is the maximum value between c and maxi, and c is 0. Otherwise, c is incremented by the value of ele.***
