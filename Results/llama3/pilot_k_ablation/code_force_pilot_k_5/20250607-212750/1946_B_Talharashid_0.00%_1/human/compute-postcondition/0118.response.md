Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input, `k` is an integer equal to the second input, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `c` is the sum of the first element in the list and 0, `maxi` is 0, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs, ele is the first element in the list. Either ele is not less than 0 or c is larger than the absolute value of ele.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated to be the sum of the first element in the list (`ele`) and its initial value (`0`). The other variables remain unchanged. The condition "Either ele is not less than 0 or c is larger than the absolute value of ele" is still valid, as the update to `c` does not affect this condition.
