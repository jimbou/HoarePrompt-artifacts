The only object in the loop head is variable  ele and list l, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list l.  If the list has at least 5 integers the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, l has at least 4 integers, ele is the fourth integer in l, i is 3. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 integers and the ele is the fifth integer in l.
State: **n is an integer, k is an integer, l is a list of integers that must have at least 5 integers, i is 3, ele is the fifth integer in l**
