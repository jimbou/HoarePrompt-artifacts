Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `l` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is 3, `c` is increased by the third integer in `l`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: a list of integers.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been updated by adding the third integer in the list `l` to it. The other variables, including `n`, `k`, `l`, `i`, and the contents of `stdin`, remain unchanged.
