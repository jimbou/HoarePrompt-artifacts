Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when k is 0. In this case, the program should return the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7, but the program does not handle this case correctly. It tries to calculate 2^k * maxi, which will be 1 * maxi when k is 0, but this is not the correct result. The correct result should be the sum of the array modulo 10^9 + 7.

For example, if the input is:

1
5 0
4 -2 8 -12 9

The program should return 7, but it returns 0.
