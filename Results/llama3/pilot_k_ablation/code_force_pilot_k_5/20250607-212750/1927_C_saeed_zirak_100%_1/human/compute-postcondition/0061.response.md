Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes - 1`.***
