Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin is empty, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is 1
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        leftOnes += 1
    elif i in a:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2. Either `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `leftOnes` is 0 and either `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `aOnes` is 0 and either `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 2 or 1, and either `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a`, `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`. If `i` is not in `a`, then either `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `leftOnes` is 0 and either `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `aOnes` is 0 and either `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 4. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 3 or 2, and either `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then if `i` is in `a`, `leftOnes` is 2, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`. If `i` is not in `a`, then either `leftOnes` is 2, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `leftOnes` is 1 and either `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `aOnes` is 0 and either `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in `a`, then either `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 2 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `leftOnes` is 0 and either `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `aOnes` is 0 and either `bOnes` is 2 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 2. If `i` is in `b`, then we don't break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k` and is increased by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 5, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
