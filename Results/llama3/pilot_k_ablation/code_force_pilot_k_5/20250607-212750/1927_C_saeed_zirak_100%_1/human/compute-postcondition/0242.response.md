Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 0, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b` and is greater than or equal to `bOnes` minus 1, `bOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a` and is greater than 0, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, and `leftOnes` remain unchanged. The value of `bOnes` has been incremented by 1, and the value of `aOnes` is now greater than or equal to `bOnes` minus 1. The stdin remains empty.
