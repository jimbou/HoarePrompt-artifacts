The only variable in the loop head is variable  t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is less than the value returned by `int(input())`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` if `leftOnes` is even, otherwise `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1, and `bOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.**
