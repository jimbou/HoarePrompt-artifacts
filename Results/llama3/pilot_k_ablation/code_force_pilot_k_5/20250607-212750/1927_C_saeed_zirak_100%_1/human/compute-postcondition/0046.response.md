Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 5, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, `aOnes` is increased by 1, `leftOnes` is either increased or not increased by 1 depending on whether `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `bOnes` is either increased or not increased by 1 depending on whether `i` is in `b` but not in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `newk` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still less than `k` and has been increased by 1. The value of `aOnes` has been increased by 1. The values of `leftOnes` and `bOnes` may or may not have been increased by 1, depending on whether `i` is in both `a` and `b` or in `b` but not in `a`, respectively. The stdin remains empty.
