Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers that are in both `a` and `b` and are less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0. Either `aOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` if it was less than `bOnes`, or `bOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` if `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`. Additionally, it is not the case that both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.***
