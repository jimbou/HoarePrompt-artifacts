The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those two.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and k.  If i is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 3 and k is greater than 2. i being 3 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to i is less than or equal to k. k being greater than 2 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to k is greater than 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `k` is greater than 3**
