Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a and b are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to k, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, i is 1, stdin is empty, t is 1
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        leftOnes += 1
    elif i in a:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty. If the current value of `i` is an integer that is present in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0. Otherwise, either `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, or `i` is not in `a` and if `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1, otherwise `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is 3, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 2, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` and not in `b`, then either `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, or `bOnes` is 1, otherwise `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. k must be greater than or equal to 3.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is less than or equal to `k` and is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 2 and `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0 and `aOnes` is 2 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `leftOnes` is 1 and `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` and not in `b`, then either `aOnes` is 2 and `bOnes` is 0, or `bOnes` is 1, otherwise `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. k must be greater than or equal to 3.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is less than `k` and is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 2 or 3 and `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1 and `aOnes` is either 2 or 3 and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `leftOnes` is either 1 or 2 and `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is not in `a` and not in `b`, then either `aOnes` is either 2 or 3 and `bOnes` is 0, or `bOnes` is 1, otherwise `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. k must be greater than or equal to 3.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is less than `k` and is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 2, 3 or 4 and `aOnes` is either 0 or 1 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 2. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 0, 1 or 2 and `aOnes` is either 2, 3 or 4 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `leftOnes` is either 1, 2 or 3 and `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not in `a` and not in `b`, then either `aOnes` is either 2, 3 or 4 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, otherwise `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. `k` must be greater than or equal to `i` + 2. If `i` is not in `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
