Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively (1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6).
Code of the loop:
for t in range(int(input())):
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
    leftOnes = 0
    aOnes = 0
    bOnes = 0
    newk = k // 2
    i = 1
    while i <= k:
        if i in a and i in b:
            leftOnes += 1
        elif i in a:
            aOnes += 1
        elif i in b:
            bOnes += 1
        else:
            break
        i += 1
    i = 0
    while i < leftOnes:
        if aOnes < bOnes:
            aOnes += 1
        else:
            bOnes += 1
        i += 1
    if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
        print('yes')
    else:
        print('no')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes - leftOnes` and is increased by `leftOnes`. The loop will continue to execute until `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. During each iteration, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` will be increased by 1. After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`, and `aOnes` will be equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes` if `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`. If `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` will be increased by `leftOnes` and `aOnes` will be greater than or equal to `bOnes - leftOnes` and will be increased by `leftOnes`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Either 'yes' is printed if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, or 'no' is printed if either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`. `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes`. `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, and 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` if `leftOnes` is even, otherwise `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1, and `bOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. If `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers that are in both `a` and `b` and are less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0. Either `aOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` if it was less than `bOnes`, or `bOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` if `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
