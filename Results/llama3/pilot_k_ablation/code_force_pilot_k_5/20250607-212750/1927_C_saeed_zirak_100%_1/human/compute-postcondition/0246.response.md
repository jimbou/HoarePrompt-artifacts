Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 1, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 1, `aOnes` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `bOnes` if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, otherwise `aOnes` is decreased by 1 and is greater than or equal to `bOnes` minus 1, and `bOnes` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, and `leftOnes` remain the same. The value of `aOnes` is increased by 1 if it was less than `bOnes`, otherwise it is decreased by 1. The value of `bOnes` is still greater than 0. The standard input is still empty.
