Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `leftOnes` is either 1, 2, or 3, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, and if `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` is 0 and `bOnes` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `leftOnes` is incremented by 1, so it can be 1, 2, or 3. The values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` depend on whether `i` is in `a`, `b`, or both. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both 0. Otherwise, `aOnes` and `bOnes` can be either 0 or 1.
