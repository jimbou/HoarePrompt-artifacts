Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `k`, `bOnes` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that `bOnes` is incremented by 1. The relationship between `i` and `k` is still maintained, where `i` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `k`.
