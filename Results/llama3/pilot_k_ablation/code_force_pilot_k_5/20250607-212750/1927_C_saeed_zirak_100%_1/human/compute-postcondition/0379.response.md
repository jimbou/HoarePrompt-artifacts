Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, t is 2, i is 1, leftOnes is 0. If i is in a, then aOnes is 1 and bOnes is 0. If i is in b, then aOnes is 0 and bOnes is 1. If i is neither in a nor in b, then the loop or if statement breaks and aOnes is 0 and bOnes is 0.***
