To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` in the loop head. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `stdin` contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4), which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` is greater than 0.

State: **stdin contains an integer `t` that must be greater than 0**
