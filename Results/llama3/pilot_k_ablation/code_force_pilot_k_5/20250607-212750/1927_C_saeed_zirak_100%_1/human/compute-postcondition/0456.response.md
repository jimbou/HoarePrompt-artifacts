Output State: **`t` is equal to 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, and 'no' is printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the input `t` will be exhausted (i.e., `t` will be 0), and the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` will have the same values as in the output state after the loop executes 3 times. The loop will have processed all the test cases, and the output will be either 'yes' or 'no' for each test case, depending on whether `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`.
