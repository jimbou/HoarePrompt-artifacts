The code `break` is executed. This statement breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, and `k` is greater than 3 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
