Postcondition: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`, `i` is equal to 0, `stdin` is empty. The current value of `aOnes` is less than the current value of `bOnes`.**
