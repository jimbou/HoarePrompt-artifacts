According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than `k`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `k`.**
