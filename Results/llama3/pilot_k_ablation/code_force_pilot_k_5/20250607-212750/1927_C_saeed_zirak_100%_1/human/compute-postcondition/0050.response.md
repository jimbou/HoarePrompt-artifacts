Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 5, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `leftOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `a` but not in `b`.***
