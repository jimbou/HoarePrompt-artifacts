Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is either 2 or 1, and either `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 0.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `leftOnes` is incremented by 1, so it is now either 2 or 1. The conditions on `aOnes`, `bOnes`, and `i-1` being in `a` or `b` also remain unchanged.
