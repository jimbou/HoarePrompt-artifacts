Postcondition: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty. The current values of `aOnes` and `bOnes` are both equal to `newk`.**
