Output State: `stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is `k+1`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`.

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing, the value of `i` will be one more than the value of `k`, and the values of `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` will be the total number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, in `a` but not in `b`, and in `b` but not in `a`, respectively.
