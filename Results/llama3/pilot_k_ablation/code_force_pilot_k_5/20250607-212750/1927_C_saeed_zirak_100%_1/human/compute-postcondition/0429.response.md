Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t`, `i`, `leftOnes`, and `k` remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1.
