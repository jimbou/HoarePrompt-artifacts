Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 1, and either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`. Additionally, `i` is not in `a` and `i` is not in `b`. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but the program flow is affected by the break statement.
