Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 3. `i` is equal to 3. `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is not changed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `a`, `b`, `leftOnes`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` remains unchanged.
