Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, t is 2, i is increased by 1 and i must be less than or equal to k. If i is in both a and b, leftOnes is increased by 1. If i is in a but not in b, aOnes is increased by 1. If i is in b but not in a, bOnes is increased by 1. If i is neither in a nor in b, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
