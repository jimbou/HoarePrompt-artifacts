Output State: **n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, t is 2, i is 1, leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `t`, `i`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` are updated according to the code. The values of `a` and `b` are also updated to be frozensets of integers, but their exact values are not specified. The value of `newk` is updated to be equal to `k` divided by 2.
