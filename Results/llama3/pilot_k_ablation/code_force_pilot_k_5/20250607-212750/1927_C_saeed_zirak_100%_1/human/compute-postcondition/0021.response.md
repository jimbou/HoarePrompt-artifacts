Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2. Either `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `leftOnes` is 0 and either `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `aOnes` is 0 and either `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain unchanged.
