Output State: **n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, t is 2, i is increased by 1 and i must be less than k and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables n, m, a, b, newk, and t remain unchanged. The value of i is still increased by 1, and it must be less than k. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
