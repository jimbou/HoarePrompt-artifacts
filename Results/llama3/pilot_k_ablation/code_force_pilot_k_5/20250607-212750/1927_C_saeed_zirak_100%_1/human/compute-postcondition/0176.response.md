Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`. `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. The current value of `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and the current value of `bOnes` is equal to `newk`. `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. `stdin` is empty.***
