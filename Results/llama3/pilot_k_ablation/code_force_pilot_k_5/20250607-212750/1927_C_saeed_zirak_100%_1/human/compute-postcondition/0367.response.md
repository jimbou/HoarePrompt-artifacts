According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `i` is 1 and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. Since `i` is already 1, which is less than or equal to any integer greater than or equal to 1, no adjustment is needed for `i`. However, for `k`, being an integer greater than or equal to 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, because `i` is 1 and `k` could be 1 as well, in which case the loop will only execute once. But since we only need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, no adjustment is needed for `k` either.
