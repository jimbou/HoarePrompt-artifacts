Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2. If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` before the execution, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` and `bOnes` is greater than `aOnes` - 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes` + 2 and `bOnes` is greater than or equal to 1. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is greater than or equal to 1 and `bOnes` is greater than `aOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes` + 1 and `bOnes` is greater than or equal to 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `bOnes` has been incremented by 1. This means that if `aOnes` was less than `bOnes` before the execution, `aOnes` is now equal to the new value of `bOnes` minus 1, and if `aOnes` was greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `aOnes` is now greater than or equal to the new value of `bOnes` plus 1.
