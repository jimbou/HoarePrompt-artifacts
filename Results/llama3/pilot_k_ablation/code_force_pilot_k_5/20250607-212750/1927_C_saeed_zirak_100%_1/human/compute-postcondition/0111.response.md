Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 2, `stdin` is empty, `leftOnes` is an integer, `aOnes` is an integer incremented by 1, `bOnes` is an integer**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `stdin`, `leftOnes`, and `bOnes` remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1.
