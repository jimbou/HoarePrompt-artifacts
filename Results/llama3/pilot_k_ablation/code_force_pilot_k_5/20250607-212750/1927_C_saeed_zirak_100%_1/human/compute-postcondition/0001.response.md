Output State: **stdin is empty, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers read from the input, and `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers also read from the input. The variables `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` are all initialized to 0, and `newk` is calculated as half of `k`. The variable `i` is set to 1. Stdin is empty after reading the input.
