Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m, k are integers assigned from stdin, a and b are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, bOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        leftOnes += 1
    elif i in a:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, stdin is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 3, and `k` must be greater than 2. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 2, `aOnes` is 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is 1, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in `a` but in `b`, then `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k` and is increased by 1, and `k` is greater than 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, and `k` is greater than 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is only in `a`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is only in `b`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is now equal to `i+1`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k` and is increased by 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to `i+1`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is only in `a`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is only in `b`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `i` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
