Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 2, `leftOnes` is an integer increased by 1, `aOnes` is an integer, `bOnes` is an integer, `stdin` is empty**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `leftOnes` is increased by 1.
