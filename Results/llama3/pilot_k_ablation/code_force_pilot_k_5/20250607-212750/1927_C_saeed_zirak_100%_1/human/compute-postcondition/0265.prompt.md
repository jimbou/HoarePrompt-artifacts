Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1, a and b are frozensets of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is equal to 0, leftOnes is the number of integers from 1 to k that are in both a and b, aOnes is the number of integers from 1 to k that are in a but not in b, bOnes is the number of integers from 1 to k that are in b but not in a, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
while i < leftOnes:
    if aOnes < bOnes:
        aOnes += 1
    else:
        bOnes += 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 1, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is decreased by 1 and is greater than or equal to `bOnes` minus 1, and `bOnes` is greater than 0.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 2, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 1, `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1 and is less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is decreased by 1 and is greater than or equal to `bOnes` minus 1, and `bOnes` is greater than 0. If `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 3, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 2, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes` minus 1, `bOnes` is greater than 0. If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 4, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 3, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is greater than 0. If `aOnes` was less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 5, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 4. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is greater than `bOnes` and `bOnes` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is greater than 1 and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
