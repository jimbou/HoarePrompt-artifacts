Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than `k`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1, but it is still less than `k`. The value of `leftOnes` is also increased by 1.
