Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `k`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all the variables retain their initial properties, but the value of `leftOnes` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t`, and `i` remain unchanged, and `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.
