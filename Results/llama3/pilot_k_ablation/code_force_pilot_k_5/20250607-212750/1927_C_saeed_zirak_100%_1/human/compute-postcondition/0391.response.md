The variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and k. If i is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is increased by 1 and i must be less than or equal to k. For the loop to be executed one more time, i must be less than k. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n, m are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, t is 2, i is increased by 1 and i must be less than k**
