Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 0, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, stdin is empty, and `i` is not in both `a` and `b`. Additionally, `i` is not in `a` and `i` is not in `b`***
