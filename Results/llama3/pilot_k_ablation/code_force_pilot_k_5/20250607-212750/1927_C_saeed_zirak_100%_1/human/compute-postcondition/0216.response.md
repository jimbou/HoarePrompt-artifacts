Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and `k` is greater than 3. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `a` or `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
