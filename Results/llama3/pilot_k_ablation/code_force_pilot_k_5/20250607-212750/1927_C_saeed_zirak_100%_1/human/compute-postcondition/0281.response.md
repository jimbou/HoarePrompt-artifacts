Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `leftOnes` is 0, `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, `i` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `t` is 1, and either `i` is not in `b`. The current value of `i` is in `a`**

In this output state, the value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k` is still valid, as well as the condition that `i` is in `a` and either `i` is not in `b`.
