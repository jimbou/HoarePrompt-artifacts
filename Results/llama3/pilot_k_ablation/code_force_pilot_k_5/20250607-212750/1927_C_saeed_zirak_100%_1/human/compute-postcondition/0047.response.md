Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 5, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, `leftOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, and `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, `leftOnes`, and `aOnes` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `bOnes` is increased by 1, indicating that `i` is in `b` but not in `a`. The stdin remains empty.
