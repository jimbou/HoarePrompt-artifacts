Postcondition: ***stdin is empty, n is an integer, m is an integer, k is at least 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is 1 and i is not in a. Either bOnes is 1 and i is in b or bOnes is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
