Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than `k`. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `a` but in `b`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
