Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are integers and `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. The value of `i` is increased by 1. The conditions for `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are still valid.
