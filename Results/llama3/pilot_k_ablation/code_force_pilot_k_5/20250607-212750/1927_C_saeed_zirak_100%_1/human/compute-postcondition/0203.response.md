Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 1 or 2.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is in both `a` and `b`. The value of `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is in `a`. The value of `bOnes` is either 1 or 2, because it was incremented by 1. The stdin is still empty.
