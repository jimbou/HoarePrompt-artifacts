Output State: **n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, t is 2, i is increased by 1 and i must be less than or equal to k, bOnes is increased by 1**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial conditions except for bOnes, which has been incremented by 1. The value of bOnes is now one more than its initial value.
