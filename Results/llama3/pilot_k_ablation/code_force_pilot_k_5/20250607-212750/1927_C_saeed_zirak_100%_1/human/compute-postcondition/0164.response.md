Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 2. `i` is equal to 3. `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1 and `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `a`, `b`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, and `bOnes` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it is now equal to 3. The stdin remains empty.
