Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 1, stdin is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
