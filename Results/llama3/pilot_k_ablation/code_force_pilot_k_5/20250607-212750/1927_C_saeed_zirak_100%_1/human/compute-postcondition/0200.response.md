The only variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust those two. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and k.  If i is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is 2, k is an integer greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to be executed one more time k must be greater than 2.
State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, stdin is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, and `bOnes` is 0. If `i` is not in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1; otherwise, `aOnes` is 0. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1; otherwise, `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. k must be greater than 2.**
