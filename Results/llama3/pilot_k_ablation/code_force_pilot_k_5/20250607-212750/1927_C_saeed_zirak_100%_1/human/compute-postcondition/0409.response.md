The variable in the loop head is variable i and k, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and k.  If i is less than or equal to k, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is increased by 1 and i must be less than or equal to k. So for the loop to be executed one more time, k must be greater than i.
State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than `k`.**
