Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` is the number of integers that are in both `a` and `b` and are less than or equal to `k` and is greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers that are only in `a` and are less than or equal to `k` and is equal to `aOnes` + 1, `bOnes` is the number of integers that are only in `b` and are less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 0. The current value of `aOnes` is less than or equal to the current value of `bOnes`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t`, `i`, `leftOnes`, `bOnes`, and `k` remain the same. The value of `aOnes` is incremented by 1, and it is now less than or equal to the value of `bOnes`.
