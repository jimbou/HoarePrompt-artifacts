Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `k`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `leftOnes` has been incremented by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t`, and `i` are still valid, and `i` is still less than or equal to `k`.
