Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k` and is increased by 1, and `k` is greater than or equal to `i+1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i` do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
