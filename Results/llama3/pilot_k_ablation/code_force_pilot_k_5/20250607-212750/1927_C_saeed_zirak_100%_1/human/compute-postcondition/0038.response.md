Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that the value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1.
