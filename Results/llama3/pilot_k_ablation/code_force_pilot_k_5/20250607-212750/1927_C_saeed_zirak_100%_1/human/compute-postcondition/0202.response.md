Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `aOnes` is 1, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. k must be greater than 2.**

In this output state, the value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. Note that `leftOnes` and `bOnes` can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `i` is in both `a` and `b`, or only in `a` or `b`, respectively.
