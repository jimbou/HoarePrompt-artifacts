Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 2, `leftOnes`, `aOnes` are integers, `bOnes` is an integer increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except `bOnes` which is increased by 1.
