Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 4, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 4. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is now greater than `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, and `bOnes` is greater than 1.***
