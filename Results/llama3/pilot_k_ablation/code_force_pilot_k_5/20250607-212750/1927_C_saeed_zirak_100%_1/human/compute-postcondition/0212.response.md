Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `k` is greater than 3, and `bOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables maintain their initial properties, and the only change is that the value of `bOnes` is incremented by 1.
