Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` and `bOnes` are integers greater than or equal to 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is greater than or equal to 1 and `bOnes` is greater than `aOnes`. Otherwise, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes` + 1 and `bOnes` is greater than or equal to 1.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the variable `i` has been incremented by 1 and is now equal to 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
