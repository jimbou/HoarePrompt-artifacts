Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`, `i` is equal to 0, `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain unchanged except for `i`, which is now equal to 0. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `a`, `b`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes`, and `stdin` are the same as before, but `i` has been reset to 0.
