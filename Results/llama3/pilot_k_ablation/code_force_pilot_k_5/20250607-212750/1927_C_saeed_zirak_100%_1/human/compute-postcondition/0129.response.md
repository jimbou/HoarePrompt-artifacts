Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers, `i` is increased by 1, `k` is greater than `i`, and `aOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: All variables keep their initial values except `aOnes` which is increased by 1. The relationship between `i` and `k` remains the same, i.e., `k` is greater than `i`.
