Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, leftOnes is the number of integers less than or equal to k that are in both a and b, aOnes is the number of integers less than or equal to k that are in a but not in b, bOnes is the number of integers less than or equal to k that are in b but not in a, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is equal to 1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
while i <= k:
    if i in a and i in b:
        leftOnes += 1
    elif i in a:
        aOnes += 1
    elif i in b:
        bOnes += 1
    else:
        break
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 2, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` plus one, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`. If `i` is not in `a` or `b`, then `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is incremented by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `i` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers, `i` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to `i`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers, `i` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than `i`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers, `i` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than `i + 1`. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
