Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 1. If `i` is in `a` and not in `b`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b` and not in `a`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is not in `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Either `i` is not in `a` or `i` is not in `b`.***
