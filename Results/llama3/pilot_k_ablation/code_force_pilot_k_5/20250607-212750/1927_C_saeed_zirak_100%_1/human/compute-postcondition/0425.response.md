Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` is the number of integers that are in both `a` and `b` and are less than or equal to `k` and is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.**
