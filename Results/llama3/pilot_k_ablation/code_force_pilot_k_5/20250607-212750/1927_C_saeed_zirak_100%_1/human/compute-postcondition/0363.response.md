Output: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0, `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` if `leftOnes` is even, otherwise `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` + 1, and `bOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. Additionally, it is not the case that `aOnes` equals `newk` and `bOnes` equals `newk`, and 'no' is printed**
