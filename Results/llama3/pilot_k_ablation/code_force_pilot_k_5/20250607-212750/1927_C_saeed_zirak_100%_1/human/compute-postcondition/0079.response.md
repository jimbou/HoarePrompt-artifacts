Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 4, `leftOnes` must be greater than 4. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 4. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes - 1` and is increased by 1, and `bOnes` is increased by 1. In both cases, `aOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, and `leftOnes` remain unchanged. The value of `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, it is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 4. If `aOnes` was initially greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is still greater than or equal to `bOnes - 1`. In both cases, `aOnes` is increased by 1.
