Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, and `k` is greater than 3. If `i` is in `a`, `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b`, `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
