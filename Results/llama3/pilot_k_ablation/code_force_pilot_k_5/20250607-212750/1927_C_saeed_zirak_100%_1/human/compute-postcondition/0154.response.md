Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 0. `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`. `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1 and is now less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is greater than `bOnes` is no longer necessarily true. `i` is equal to 1. `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now equal to 1. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
