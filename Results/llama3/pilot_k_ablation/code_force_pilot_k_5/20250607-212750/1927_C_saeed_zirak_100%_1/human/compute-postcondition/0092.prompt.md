You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.


Example Answer:
The only objects in the loop head are variables  index, students  and list  students_list, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: *`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes - leftOnes` and is increased by `leftOnes`. The loop will continue to execute until `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. During each iteration, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` will be increased by 1. After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`, and `aOnes` will be equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes` if `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`. If `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` will be increased by `leftOnes` and `aOnes` will be greater than or equal to `bOnes - leftOnes` and will be increased by `leftOnes`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Either 'yes' is printed if `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and `bOnes` is equal to `newk`, or 'no' is printed if either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`.
```
for t in range(int(input())):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time? Only the states of objects in the loop head can be adjusted.
