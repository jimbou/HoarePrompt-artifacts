Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, and `k` must be greater than 2. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is 1, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not in `a`, then `aOnes` is either 0 or 1, `leftOnes` is either 0 or 1, and `bOnes` is either 0, 1, or 2. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. Otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
