Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` must be greater than 2. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 3. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes - 1` and is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `aOnes` has been incremented by 1. If `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`, it is now either equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 3. If `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` is still increased by 1 and `aOnes` is still greater than or equal to `bOnes - 1` and is increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
