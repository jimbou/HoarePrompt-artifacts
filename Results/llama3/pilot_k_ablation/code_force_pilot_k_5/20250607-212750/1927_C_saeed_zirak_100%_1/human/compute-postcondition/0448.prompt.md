Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` is the number of integers that are in both `a` and `b` and are less than or equal to `k`, `aOnes` is the number of integers that are only in `a` and are less than or equal to `k`, `bOnes` is the number of integers that are only in `b` and are less than or equal to `k`.
Code of the loop:
while i < leftOnes:
    if aOnes < bOnes:
        aOnes += 1
    else:
        bOnes += 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 1, `leftOnes` is the number of integers that are in both `a` and `b` and are less than or equal to `k` and is greater than 0, `k` is greater than 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 2, `leftOnes` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 3, `leftOnes` is greater than 2, `k` is greater than 0. Either `aOnes` is increased by 1 if it was less than `bOnes`, or `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 4, `leftOnes` is greater than 3, `k` is greater than 0. Either `aOnes` is increased by 1 if it was less than `bOnes`, or `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 5, `leftOnes` is greater than 4, `k` is greater than 0. Either `aOnes` is increased by 1 if it was less than `bOnes`, or `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
