Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k`, `b` is a frozenset of integers that has at least one integer less than or equal to `k` and is in common with `a`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is 4, `leftOnes` is greater than 4, `k` is greater than 0. Either `aOnes` is increased by 1 if it was less than `bOnes`, or `bOnes` is increased by 1 if `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`.**
