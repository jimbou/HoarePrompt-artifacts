Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than or equal to 0. `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`. `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes`. `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. `stdin` is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `aOnes` and `bOnes` are either equal or `aOnes` is greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes`, and `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. The other variables remain unchanged.
