Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than or equal to `k`, `aOnes` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state remain unchanged except for `aOnes`, which has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `t` are still the same as in the initial state. The value of `i` has been increased by 1, but it is still less than or equal to `k`. The value of `aOnes` has been increased by 1, but its initial value is not specified.
