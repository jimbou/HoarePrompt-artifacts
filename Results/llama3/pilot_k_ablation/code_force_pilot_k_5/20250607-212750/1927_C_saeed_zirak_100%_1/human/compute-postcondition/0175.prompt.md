Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`, `i` is equal to 0, `stdin` is empty.
Code of the loop:
while i < leftOnes:
    if aOnes < bOnes:
        aOnes += 1
    else:
        bOnes += 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 0. `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`. `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1 and is now less than or equal to `bOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1 and `aOnes` is greater than `bOnes` is no longer necessarily true. `i` is equal to 1. `stdin` is empty.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 1. `i` is equal to 2. `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 2. `i` is equal to 3. `stdin` is empty. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1 and `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 3. `i` is equal to 4. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1 and `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is either equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1 and `aOnes` is increased by 1, and `bOnes` is increased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 4. `i` is equal to 5. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 2 and `bOnes` remains the same. If `aOnes` was originally greater than or equal to `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1 and `bOnes` is increased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
