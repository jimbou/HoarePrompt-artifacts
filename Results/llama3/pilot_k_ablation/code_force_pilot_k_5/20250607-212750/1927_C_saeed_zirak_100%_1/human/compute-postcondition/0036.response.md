Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, `leftOnes` is increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables remain the same as in the initial state, except for `leftOnes`, which has been incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, and `i` are unchanged, and `stdin` is still empty.
