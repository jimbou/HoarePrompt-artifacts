Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to 1, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b` and is greater than 1, `bOnes` is greater than 0 and is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `bOnes` has been increased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The relationship between `aOnes` and `bOnes` is still maintained, but the exact value of `aOnes` is not specified. The stdin remains empty.
