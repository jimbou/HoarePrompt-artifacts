Postcondition: ***`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 2, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 2. Either `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in both `a` and `b`, or `leftOnes` is 0 and either `aOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `a`, or `aOnes` is 0 and either `bOnes` is 1 and `i-1` is in `b` or `bOnes` is 1. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1, otherwise we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
