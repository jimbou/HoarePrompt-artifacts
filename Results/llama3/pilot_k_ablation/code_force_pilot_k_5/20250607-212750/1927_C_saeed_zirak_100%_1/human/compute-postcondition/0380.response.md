Postcondition: ***n, m, k are integers greater than or equal to 1, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, t is 2. If the current value of i is in both a and b, then leftOnes is 1, aOnes is 0, and bOnes is 0. If i is only in a, then leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 1, and bOnes is 0. If i is only in b, then leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, and bOnes is 1. If i is neither in a nor in b, then leftOnes is 0, aOnes is 0, and bOnes is 0.***
