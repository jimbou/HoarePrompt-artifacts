Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is 0, `leftOnes` must be greater than 0, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b` and is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, and `leftOnes` remain unchanged. The value of `aOnes` has increased by 1, and it is now either equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1. The value of `bOnes` remains unchanged.
