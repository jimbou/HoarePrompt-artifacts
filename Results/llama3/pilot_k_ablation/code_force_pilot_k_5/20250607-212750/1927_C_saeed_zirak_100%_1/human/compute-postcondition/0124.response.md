Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k`, `newk`, `leftOnes`, `aOnes`, `bOnes` are integers, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers, `i` is increased by 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to `i`. If `i` is in `a`, then `aOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is increased by 1. If `i` is neither in `a` nor in `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
