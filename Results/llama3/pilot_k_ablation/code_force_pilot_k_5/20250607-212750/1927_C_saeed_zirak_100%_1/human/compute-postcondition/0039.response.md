Output State: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is at least 4, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than or equal to `k`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all the variables maintain their initial values and properties, as the `break` statement does not affect any variable values. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement we were directly inside.
