Output: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes - leftOnes` and is increased by `leftOnes`. The loop will continue to execute until `i` is equal to `leftOnes`. During each iteration, if `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, `aOnes` will be increased by 1. Otherwise, `bOnes` will be increased by 1. After the loop finishes executing, `i` will be equal to `leftOnes`, and `aOnes` will be equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes` if `aOnes` was initially less than `bOnes`. If `aOnes` was not less than `bOnes`, then `bOnes` will be increased by `leftOnes` and `aOnes` will be greater than or equal to `bOnes - leftOnes` and will be increased by `leftOnes`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Additionally, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, and 'no' is printed**
