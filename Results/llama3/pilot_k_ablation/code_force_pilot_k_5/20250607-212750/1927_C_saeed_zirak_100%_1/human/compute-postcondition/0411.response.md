Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 2, `i` is increased by 1 and `i` must be less than `k`, `aOnes` is increased by 1**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `t`, and `k` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is increased by 1, but it is still less than `k`. The only variable that has changed is `aOnes`, which has been incremented by 1.
