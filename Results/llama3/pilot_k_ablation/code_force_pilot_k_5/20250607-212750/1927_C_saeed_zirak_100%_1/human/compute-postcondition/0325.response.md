Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is less than `k` and is incremented by 1, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in both `a` and `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 2, 3 or 4 and `aOnes` is either 0 or 1 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 2. If `i` is in `a` but not in `b`, then `leftOnes` is either 0, 1 or 2 and `aOnes` is either 2, 3 or 4 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. If `i` is in `b` but not in `a`, then `leftOnes` is either 1, 2 or 3 and `aOnes` is 1 and `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not in `a` and not in `b`, then either `aOnes` is either 2, 3 or 4 and `bOnes` is either 0 or 1, otherwise `bOnes` is either 0 or 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not in `b`, then `bOnes` is either 0 or 1. `k` must be greater than or equal to `i` + 2. If `i` is not in `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
