Output State: **n is an integer, m is an integer, k is an integer, a is a frozenset of integers, b is a frozenset of integers, leftOnes is the number of integers less than or equal to k that are in both a and b, aOnes is the number of integers less than or equal to k that are in a but not in b, bOnes is the number of integers less than or equal to k that are in b but not in a, newk is an integer equal to k divided by 2, i is equal to 1, stdin is empty**

The initial state is modified by the code as follows: 

- The first line assigns the integer values of the input to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
- The second line assigns a frozenset of integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin now contains a space-separated list of integers.
- The third line assigns a frozenset of integers from stdin to `b`. Stdin is now empty.
- The fourth line assigns 0 to `leftOnes`.
- The fifth line assigns 0 to `aOnes`.
- The sixth line assigns 0 to `bOnes`.
- The seventh line assigns the integer value of `k` divided by 2 to `newk`.
- The eighth line assigns 1 to `i`.

The values of `aOnes`, `bOnes`, `leftOnes`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, and `newk` are updated. The value of `stdin` is also updated as it is now empty.
