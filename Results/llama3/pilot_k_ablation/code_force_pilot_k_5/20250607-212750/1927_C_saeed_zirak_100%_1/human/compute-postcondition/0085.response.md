Postcondition: **`stdin` is empty, `n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a frozenset of integers, `b` is a frozenset of integers, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `a` but not in `b`, `bOnes` is the number of integers less than or equal to `k` that are in `b` but not in `a`. If `aOnes` is less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by `leftOnes`. Otherwise, `bOnes` is increased by `leftOnes` and `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes - leftOnes` and is increased by `leftOnes`. The current value of `aOnes` is equal to `newk` and the current value of `bOnes` is equal to `newk`.**
