Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers. `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2. `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers. `leftOnes` is greater than 3. `i` is equal to 3. If `aOnes` was originally less than `bOnes`, then `aOnes` is now equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1 and `aOnes` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `aOnes` is either equal to `bOnes` or greater than `bOnes` by 1 and `aOnes` is increased by 1, and `bOnes` is increased by 1.***
