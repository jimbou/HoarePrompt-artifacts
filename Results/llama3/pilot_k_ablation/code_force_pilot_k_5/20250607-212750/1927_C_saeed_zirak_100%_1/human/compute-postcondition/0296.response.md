Postcondition: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `t` is 1, `i` is 2, `stdin` is empty. If `i` is in `b`, then `leftOnes` is 1, `aOnes` is 0, `bOnes` is 1. Otherwise, either `i` is in `a` and `aOnes` is 1, `bOnes` is 0, or `i` is not in `a` and if `i` is in `b`, then `bOnes` is 1, otherwise `bOnes` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
