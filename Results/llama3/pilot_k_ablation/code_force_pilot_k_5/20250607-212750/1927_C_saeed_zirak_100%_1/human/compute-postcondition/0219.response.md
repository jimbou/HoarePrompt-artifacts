Output State: **`n`, `m` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers assigned from stdin, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is less than `k` and is increased by 1, `k` is greater than 3, and `leftOnes` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `m`, `a`, `b`, `newk`, `i`, and `k` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that the value of `leftOnes` is increased by 1.
