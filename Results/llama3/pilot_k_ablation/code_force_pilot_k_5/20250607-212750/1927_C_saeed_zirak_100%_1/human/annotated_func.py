#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) followed by t test cases. Each test case consists of three integers n, m, and k (1 <= n, m <= 2*10^5, 2 <= k <= 2*min(n, m), k is even) followed by two lists of integers a and b of lengths n and m respectively (1 <= a_i, b_j <= 10^6).
    for t in range(int(input())):
        n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
        
        b = frozenset(map(int, input().split()))
        
        leftOnes = 0
        
        aOnes = 0
        
        bOnes = 0
        
        newk = k // 2
        
        i = 1
        
        while i <= k:
            if i in a and i in b:
                leftOnes += 1
            elif i in a:
                aOnes += 1
            elif i in b:
                bOnes += 1
            else:
                break
            i += 1
        
        i = 0
        
        while i < leftOnes:
            if aOnes < bOnes:
                aOnes += 1
            else:
                bOnes += 1
            i += 1
        
        if aOnes == newk and bOnes == newk:
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
        
    #State: `t` is equal to 0, `n`, `m`, `k` are integers greater than or equal to 1, `a` and `b` are frozensets of integers with at least one common integer from 1 to `k`, `newk` is an integer equal to `k` divided by 2, `i` is equal to `leftOnes`, `leftOnes` is the number of integers from 1 to `k` that are in both `a` and `b`, `aOnes` is greater than or equal to `bOnes`, `bOnes` is greater than 0, `stdin` is empty. If both `aOnes` and `bOnes` are equal to `newk`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, either `aOnes` is not equal to `newk` or `bOnes` is not equal to `newk`, and 'no' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, processes test cases, and determines whether two sets of integers can be balanced by adding or removing elements. It accepts no parameters and returns no values, but instead prints 'yes' or 'no' to indicate whether the sets can be balanced. The function iterates through each test case, counting common elements and adjusting the counts to balance the sets. If the sets can be balanced, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'.
