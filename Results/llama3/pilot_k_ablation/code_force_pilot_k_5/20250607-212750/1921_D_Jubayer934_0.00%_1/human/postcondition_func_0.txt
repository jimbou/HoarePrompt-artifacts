This function processes multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case contains two lists of integers. It calculates the absolute differences between the maximum values of the first list and the minimum values of the second list, after removing elements from the second list to make it the same length as the first list. The function then prints the sum of these absolute differences for each test case.
