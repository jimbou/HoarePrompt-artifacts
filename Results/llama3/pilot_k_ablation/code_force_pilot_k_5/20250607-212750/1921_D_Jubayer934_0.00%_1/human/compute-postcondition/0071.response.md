Output State: **n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 3, m is at least 4, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 4 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, the third integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, and the fourth integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains unchanged as it is not used or modified by the code. The value of `m` remains at least 4 as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` has been updated by removing its maximum value, so it now contains at least 2 integers. The list `b` has also been updated by removing its minimum value, so it remains a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers. The list `result` has been appended with the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list `a` and the minimum value in the updated list `b`, so it now contains 4 integers.
