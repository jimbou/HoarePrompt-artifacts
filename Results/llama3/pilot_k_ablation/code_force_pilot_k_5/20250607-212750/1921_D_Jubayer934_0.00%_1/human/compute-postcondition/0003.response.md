To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. The loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is already 0, we don't need to change it. However, we need to ensure that `a` has at least one element for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, `i` is 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus one, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list**
