The code prints the sum of the result list, which contains the absolute differences between the original maximum of list a and the original minimum of list b, the new maximum of list a and the new minimum of list b, the maximum of list a after removing its maximum and the minimum of list b after removing its minimum, and so on, until the maximum of list a after removing its maximum m-1 times and the minimum of list b after removing its minimum m-1 times.

Since the exact values of m and n are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum of the result list. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum of list a and the minimum of list b, after removing elements from both lists m times.

Output: **sum of absolute differences between max of list a and min of list b after removing elements m times (where m is the value of m)**
