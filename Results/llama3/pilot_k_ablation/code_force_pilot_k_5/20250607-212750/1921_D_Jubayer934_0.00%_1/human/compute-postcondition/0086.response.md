Postcondition: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**
