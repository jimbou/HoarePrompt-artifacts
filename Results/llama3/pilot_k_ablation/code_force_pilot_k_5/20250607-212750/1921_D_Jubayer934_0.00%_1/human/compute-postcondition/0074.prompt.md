Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is equal to `len(a)`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)`) integers, `result` is an empty list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
    a.remove(max(a))
    b.remove(min(b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 0, m is an integer, a is a list of m-1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 1, m is an integer, a is a list of m-2 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 2 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 2, m is at least 4, a is a list of m-3 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 3 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, the third integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 3, m is at least 4, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 4 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, the third integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, and the fourth integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 4, m is at least 4, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 5 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, the third integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, the fourth integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, and the fifth integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
