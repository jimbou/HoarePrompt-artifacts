Output State: **m is at least 3, n is an integer, i is 2, a is a list of at least 1 integer, b is a list of n-3 integers, result is a list containing 3 integers**

In this final state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 2 as it is not affected by the code. The list `a` initially had at least 2 integers, but after removing the maximum value, it now has at least 1 integer. The list `b` initially had n-2 integers, but after removing the minimum value, it now has n-3 integers. The list `result` initially had 2 integers, but after appending the absolute difference between the maximum value of `a` and the minimum value of `b`, it now has 3 integers. Stdin remains empty as it was not used by the code.
