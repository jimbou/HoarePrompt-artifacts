Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-4` integers, `result` is an empty list. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `n` is still at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` remains 3. The list `a` still contains `m` integers with at least 3 integers. The list `b` is now a sorted list of `n-4` integers, as one element has been removed from it. The list `result` remains empty. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the lengths of `a` and `b` being equal.
