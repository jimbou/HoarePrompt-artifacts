Output: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is equal to m, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of n-m integers, result is a list containing m integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum, and so on, until the maximum of a after removing its maximum m-1 times and the minimum of b after removing its minimum m-1 times, and the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is being printed**
