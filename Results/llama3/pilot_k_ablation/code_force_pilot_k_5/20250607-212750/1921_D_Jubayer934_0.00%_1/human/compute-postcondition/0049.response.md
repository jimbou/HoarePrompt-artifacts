Output State: **`n` is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is at least 1 and less than `len(a)`, `m` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)` - 2) integers, `result` is an empty list. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)` - 2) integers, since one element has been removed from the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the lengths of `a` and `b`.
