Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer, i is 0, a is a list of m-1 integers, b is a list of n-1 integers, result is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the maximum integer in the original list a and the minimum integer in the original list b, stdin is empty**

The code snippet first calculates the absolute difference between the maximum integer in list `a` and the minimum integer in list `b`, and appends this value to the `result` list. Then, it removes the maximum integer from list `a` and the minimum integer from list `b`. As a result, list `a` now contains `m-1` integers and list `b` contains `n-1` integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0, and `stdin` remains empty.
