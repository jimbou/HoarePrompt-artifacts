To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `a` is a list of `m-2` integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2.

Since `a` is a list of `m-2` integers, its length is `m-2`. For the loop to execute again, the length of `a` must be at least 2, so `m` must be at least 4.

The other variables `n`, `m`, `b`, and `result` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is 2, `m` is at least 4, `a` is a list of `m-2` integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, `result` is a list containing 2 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.**
