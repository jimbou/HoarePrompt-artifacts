Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is `m`, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list, the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `m` remains an integer, `n` remains at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` becomes equal to `m`, `a` remains a list of `m` integers, `b` becomes an empty list because all its elements have been removed, `result` remains an empty list, and the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is still not being printed. The loop breaks when the length of `a` equals the length of `b`, which happens when `b` becomes empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
    a.remove(max(a))
    b.remove(min(b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 0 and less than m, a is a list of m-1 integers, b is a list with one less element, result is a list with one element which is the absolute difference between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 1 and less than m, a is a list of m-2 integers, b is a list with two less elements, result is a list with two elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 2 and less than m, a is a list of at least 1 integers, b is a list with at least 1 elements, result is a list with three elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 3 and less than m, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a list with at least 0 elements, result is a list with four elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 4 and less than m, a is a list of at least 1 integers, b is a list with at least 0 elements, result is a list with five elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
