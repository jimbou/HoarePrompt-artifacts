Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is equal to `m`, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m` integers, `result` is an empty list.

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of list `a` (which is `m`), and list `b` will have `n-m` integers left, as `m` elements have been removed from it. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
    a.remove(max(a))
    b.remove(min(b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 0, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-1 integers, result is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 1, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-2 integers, result is a list containing 2 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, and the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 2, a is a list of at least 1 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-3 integers, result is a list containing 3 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, and the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 3, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-4 integers, result is a list containing 4 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum, and the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 4, a is a list of at least 3 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-5 integers, result is a list containing 5 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum, the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum, and the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
