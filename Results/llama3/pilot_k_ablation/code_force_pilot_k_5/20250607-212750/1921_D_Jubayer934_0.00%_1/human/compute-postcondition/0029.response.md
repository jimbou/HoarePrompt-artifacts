Output State: **n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 1, m is an integer, a is a list of at least 0 and at most m-2 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, and the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `m` is also unchanged as it is not modified by the code.

The list `a` is modified by the code, as the maximum value is removed from it. The length of `a` is now at most `m-2` as one element is removed. The list `b` is also modified by the code, as the minimum value is removed from it. The length of `b` is still `max(0, n - len(a))` as the removal of the minimum value does not change the length of the list.

The list `result` is modified by the code, as the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list `a` and the minimum value in the original list `b` is appended to it. The list `result` now contains two values: the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list `a` and the minimum value in the original list `b`, and the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list `a` and the minimum value in the updated list `b`.
