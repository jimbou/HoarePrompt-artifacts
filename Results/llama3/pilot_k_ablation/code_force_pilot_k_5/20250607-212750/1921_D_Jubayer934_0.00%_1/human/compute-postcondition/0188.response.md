The code prints the sum of all elements in the list `result`.
Since the exact elements of the list `result` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of the sum. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the sum of all elements in the list `result`.
Output: **sum of all elements in the list result**
