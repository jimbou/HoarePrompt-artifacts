Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and the third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    m, n = map(int, input().split())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))[:m]
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))[:n]
    b.sort()
    result = []
    n = n // 2
    for i in range(len(a)):
        if len(a) == len(b):
            break
        b.remove(b[n - 1])
    for i in range(len(a)):
        result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
        a.remove(max(a))
        b.remove(min(b))
    print(sum(result))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is equal to the length of a, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists a and b at different stages, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists a and b at different stages which is equal to sum(result) is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 0, m is an integer, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing m integers, each integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, and the sum of result is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is equal to m, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of n-m integers, result is a list containing m integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum, and so on, until the maximum of a after removing its maximum m-1 times and the minimum of b after removing its minimum m-1 times, and the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is equal to m, a is a list of m integers, b is an empty list, result is a list with m elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b, and the sum of the result list is printed which is equal to m times the maximum value in a since b is empty and the minimum value in b is undefined and the absolute difference is always positive

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: m is an integer, n is an integer, i is m, a is an empty list, b is a list of n-m integers, result is a list containing m integers, stdin is empty, and the sum of the list result which is equal to the sum of m integers is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
