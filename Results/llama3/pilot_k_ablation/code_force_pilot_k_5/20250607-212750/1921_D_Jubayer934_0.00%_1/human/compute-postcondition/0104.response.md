To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `a` has at least 0 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must have at least 1 integer.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-1` integers, `result` is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`**
