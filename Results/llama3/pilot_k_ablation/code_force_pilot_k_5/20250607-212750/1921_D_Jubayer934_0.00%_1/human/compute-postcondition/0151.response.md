To determine what will be printed when the `print(sum(result))` statement is executed, let's break down the initial state and the variables involved:

1. **m is an integer**: This means `m` has a specific integer value, but we don't know what it is.
2. **n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2**: This implies that `n` is a result of some calculation involving its original value, but since we don't know the original value of `n`, we can't calculate its exact value. However, we know it's at least 0.25.
3. **i is equal to m**: This means `i` has the same value as `m`, which is an integer.
4. **a is a list of m integers**: This list contains `m` number of integers, but we don't know their values.
5. **b is an empty list**: This list is empty, meaning it contains no elements.
6. **result is a list with m elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b**: Since `b` is an empty list, it does not have a minimum value. However, the description implies that the calculation for `result` involves comparing elements of `a` with something in `b`, but since `b` is empty, this comparison is not possible in the conventional sense. Given the information, we might infer that the intention was to describe a scenario where `b` is not empty, but based strictly on the given state, `b` is empty.

Given these points, when we consider the `print(sum(result))` statement:

- The `result` list is supposed to contain the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`. However, since `b` is empty, there is no minimum value in `b`, which makes the calculation for `result` as described impossible.
- Despite this, if we were to follow the logic provided and assume `result` was calculated based on some default or error value when `b` is empty (which isn't specified), the sum of `result` would be the sum of these calculated differences, repeated `m` times.

However, strictly adhering to the information given and the format requested, without making assumptions beyond the provided state:

Output: **This cannot be precisely determined due to the empty list b, but it would be the sum of m calculated differences if b were not empty.**
