The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `a` has at least 1 element. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed.**
