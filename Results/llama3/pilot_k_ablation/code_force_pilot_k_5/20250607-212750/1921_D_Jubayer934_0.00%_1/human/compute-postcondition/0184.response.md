Output State: **m is at least 3, n is an integer, i is 3, a is a list of at least 3 integers, b is a list of n-4 integers, result is a list containing 4 integers**

The code snippet modifies the lists `a` and `b`, and the list `result`. The value of `m` and `i` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is not modified by the code snippet. 

The first line appends the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b` to the list `result`. This increases the length of `result` by 1. 

The second line removes the maximum value from list `a`. Since `a` initially had at least 4 integers, it now has at least 3 integers.

The third line removes the minimum value from list `b`. Since `b` initially had n-3 integers, it now has n-4 integers.
