The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `a` has at least 0 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 2 integers.
State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 2, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-2 integers, result is a list containing 2 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, and the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b.**
