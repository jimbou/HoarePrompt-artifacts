Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `result` remain unchanged.
