To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `len(a)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 3 and less than `len(a)`. To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

State: **`n` is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is at least 4 and less than `len(a)`, `m` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)` - 2) integers, `result` is an empty list**
