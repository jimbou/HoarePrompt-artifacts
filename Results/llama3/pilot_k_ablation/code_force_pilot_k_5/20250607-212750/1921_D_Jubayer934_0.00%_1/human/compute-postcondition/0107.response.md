Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 2, a is a list of at least 1 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-3 integers, result is a list containing 3 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, and the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum.**

In this final state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains the same, being at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` is still 2. 

The list `a` now contains at least 1 integer because the maximum value was removed from it. The list `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-3` integers because the minimum value was removed from it. 

The list `result` now contains 3 integers. The first two integers are the absolute differences between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`, and the new maximum of `a` and the new minimum of `b`. The third integer is the absolute difference between the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum.
