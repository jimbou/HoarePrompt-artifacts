Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(a)`, `m` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)`) integers, `result` is an empty list, `stdin` is empty, and the sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists `a` and `b` at different stages which is equal to `sum(result)` is being printed. The current value of `len(a)` is equal to `len(b)`.***
