To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `a` has at least 2 and at most `m-3` integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4. Since `i` is now 4, the length of `a` must be at least 5 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, `i` is 4, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 5 and at most `m-3` integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - len(`a`)) integers, `result` is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists `a` and `b` at different stages, and it has one more element than before.**
