To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `a` is a list of at least 1 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, the length of `a` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `m`, `n`, `b`, and `result` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-3` integers, `result` is a list containing 3 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`, the new maximum of `a` and the new minimum of `b`, and the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum.**
