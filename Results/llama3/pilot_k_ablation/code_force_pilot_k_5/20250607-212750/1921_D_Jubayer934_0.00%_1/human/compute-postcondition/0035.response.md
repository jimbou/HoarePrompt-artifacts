Output State: **n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 4, m is an integer, a is a list of at least 4 and at most m-3 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists a and b at different stages, and it has two more elements than before.**

In this final state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `m` is still an integer, but its exact value is not specified. The list `a` has been modified by removing its maximum value, so it now contains at least 4 and at most `m-3` integers. The list `b` has also been modified by removing its minimum value, so it remains a sorted list of `max(0, n - len(a))` integers. The list `result` has been appended with the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` at the current stage, and it now has two more elements than before.
