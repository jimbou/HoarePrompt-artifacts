Output: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is equal to m, a is a list of m integers, b is an empty list, result is a list with m elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b, and the sum of the result list is printed which is equal to m times the maximum value in a since b is empty and the minimum value in b is undefined and the absolute difference is always positive**
