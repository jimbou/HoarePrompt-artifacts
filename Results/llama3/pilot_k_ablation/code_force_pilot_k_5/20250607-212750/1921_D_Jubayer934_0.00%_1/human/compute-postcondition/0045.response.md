Output State: **`n` is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is at least 0 and less than `len(a)`, `m` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)` - 1) integers, `result` is an empty list. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute. The sum of the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists `a` and `b` at different stages, which is equal to `sum(result)`, is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated by removing the last element (`b[n - 1]`) from the list. The length of `b` is now `max(0, n - len(a) - 1)`, which is one less than its original length. The other variables remain unchanged. The program continues to execute unless the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, in which case it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
