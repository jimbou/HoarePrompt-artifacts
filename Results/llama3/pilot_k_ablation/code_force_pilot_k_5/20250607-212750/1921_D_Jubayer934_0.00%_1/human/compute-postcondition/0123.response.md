Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code `break` does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we are now outside the most internal loop or if statement.
