Output State: **n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 2, m is at least 4, a is a list of m-3 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 3 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, the third integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.**

The code appends the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list `a` and the minimum value in the original list `b` to the `result` list. Then, it removes the maximum value from list `a` and the minimum value from list `b`. As a result, list `a` now contains `m-3` integers, and list `b` remains a sorted list of `max(0, n - len(a))` integers. The `result` list now contains three integers, representing the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in the original and updated lists `a` and `b`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `m` remain unchanged.
