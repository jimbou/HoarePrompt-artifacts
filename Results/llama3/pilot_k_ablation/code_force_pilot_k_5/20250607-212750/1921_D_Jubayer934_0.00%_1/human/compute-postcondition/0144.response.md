To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(a)):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 1 and less than `m`, and `a` is a list of `m-2` integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and `a` must still have at least `i` elements. Since `i` is now at least 2, `a` must have at least 2 elements.

The other variables `m`, `n`, `b`, and `result` are not involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is at least 2 and less than `m`, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a list with two less elements, `result` is a list with two elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`.**
