Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 3 and less than m, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a list with at least 0 elements, result is a list with four elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.**

In this output state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, being at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` remains unchanged, being at least 3 and less than `m`.

The list `a` originally had at least 3 integers, but after the execution of the code, it has at least 2 integers because the maximum value in `a` was removed.

The list `b` originally had at least 1 element, but after the execution of the code, it has at least 0 elements because the minimum value in `b` was removed.

The list `result` originally had three elements, which were the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`. After the execution of the code, `result` has four elements because the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` was appended to `result`.
