To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `m`, and `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `m + 1`. Since `n` is not changed in the loop body, its value remains the same.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is `m + 1`, `a` is an empty list, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m` integers, `result` is a list containing `m` integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`, the new maximum of `a` and the new minimum of `b`, the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum, and so on, until the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum `m-1` times and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum `m-1` times, and the sum of the absolute differences in the `result` list is being printed**
