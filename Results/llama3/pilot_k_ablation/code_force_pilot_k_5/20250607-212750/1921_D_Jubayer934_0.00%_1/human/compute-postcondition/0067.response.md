Output State: **n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, i is 1, m is an integer, a is a list of m-2 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing 2 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The value of `m` remains an integer as it is not modified by the code. The list `a` is updated by removing its maximum value, so it now contains `m-2` integers. The list `b` is also updated by removing its minimum value, so it remains a sorted list of `max(0, n - len(a))` integers. The list `result` is updated by appending the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list `a` and the minimum value in the updated list `b`, so it now contains 2 integers.
