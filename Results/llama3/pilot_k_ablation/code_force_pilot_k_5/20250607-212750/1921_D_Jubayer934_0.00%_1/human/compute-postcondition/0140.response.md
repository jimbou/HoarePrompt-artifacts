To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `a`. If `a` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is equal to `m`, but it needs to be adjusted to be within the range of indices of `a`. Since `a` has `m` elements, the indices range from 0 to `m-1`. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to be at least 0 and less than `m`.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is at least 0 and less than `m`, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is an empty list, `result` is an empty list, the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
