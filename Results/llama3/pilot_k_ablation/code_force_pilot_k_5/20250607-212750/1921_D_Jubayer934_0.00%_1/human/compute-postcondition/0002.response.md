Output State: **n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, m is an integer, a is a list of m integers, b is a sorted list of n integers, result is an empty list.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been halved, and `m` has been assigned an integer value. The list `a` contains `m` integers, and the list `b` contains `n` sorted integers. The list `result` is empty. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0. Stdin now contains one less test case.
