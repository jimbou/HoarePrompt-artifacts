Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of `n-2` integers, `result` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The values of the variables `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `result` do not change.
