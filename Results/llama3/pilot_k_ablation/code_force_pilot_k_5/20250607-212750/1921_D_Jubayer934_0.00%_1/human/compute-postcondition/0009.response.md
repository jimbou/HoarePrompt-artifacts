Output State: **`n` is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, `i` is 1, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, all variables retain their original values. The output state includes all the information from the initial state, with the additional note that we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
