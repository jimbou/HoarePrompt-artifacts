The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2 and less than `len(a)`, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is at least 3 and less than `len(a)` and `a` is a list of at least 2 integers.
State: **`n` is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is at least 3 and less than `len(a)`, `m` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)` - 1) integers, `result` is an empty list.**
