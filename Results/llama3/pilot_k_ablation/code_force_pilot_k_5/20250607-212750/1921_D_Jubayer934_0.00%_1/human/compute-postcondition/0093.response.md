Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-3` integers, `result` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `result` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
