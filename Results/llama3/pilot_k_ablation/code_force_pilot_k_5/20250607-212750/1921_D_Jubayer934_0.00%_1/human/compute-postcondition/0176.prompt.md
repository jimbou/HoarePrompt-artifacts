Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: m is an integer, n is an integer, i is an integer, a is a list of m integers, b is a list of n integers, result is an empty list, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if len(a) == len(b):
        break
    b.remove(b[n - 1])


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` equals the length of `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of `n-2` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 2 elements, `b` is a list of `n-3` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of `n-4` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 4 elements, `b` is a list of `n-5` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
