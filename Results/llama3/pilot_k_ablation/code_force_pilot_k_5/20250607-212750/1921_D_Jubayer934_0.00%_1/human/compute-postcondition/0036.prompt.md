Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, `i` is equal to the length of `a`, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of `m` integers, `b` is a sorted list of `max(0, n - len(a))` integers, `result` is an empty list.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `i` has reached the length of `a`, and `b` has been reduced to a sorted list of `max(0, n - len(a))` integers. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    result.append(abs(max(a) - min(b)))
    a.remove(max(a))
    b.remove(min(b))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 0, m is an integer, a is a list of at least 0 and at most m-1 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 1, m is an integer, a is a list of at least 0 and at most m-2 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, and the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 2, m is an integer, a is a list of at least 0 and at most m-3 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, and the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 3, m is an integer, a is a list of at least 2 and at most m-3 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists a and b at different stages, and it has one more element than before.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: n is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, i is 4, m is an integer, a is a list of at least 4 and at most m-3 integers, b is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, result is a list containing the absolute differences between the maximum and minimum values in lists a and b at different stages, and it has two more elements than before.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
