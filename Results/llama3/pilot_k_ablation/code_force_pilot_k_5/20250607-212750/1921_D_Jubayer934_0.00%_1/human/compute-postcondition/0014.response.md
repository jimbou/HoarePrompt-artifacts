Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, `i` is 2, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-2` integers, `result` is an empty list. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
