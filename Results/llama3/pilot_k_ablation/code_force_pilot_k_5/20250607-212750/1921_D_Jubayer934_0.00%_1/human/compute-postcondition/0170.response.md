Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a list of `n-3` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
