The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `a` has at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 4 integers.
State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-4` integers, `result` is a list containing 4 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`, the new maximum of `a` and the new minimum of `b`, the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum, and the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum.**
