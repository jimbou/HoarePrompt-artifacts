Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 1, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-2 integers, result is a list containing 2 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, and the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b.**

In this output state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, being at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` remains 1. 

The list `a` has been modified by removing its maximum value, so it now contains at least 0 integers. 

The list `b` has also been modified by removing its minimum value, so it now contains n-m-2 integers and remains sorted.

The list `result` has been modified by appending the absolute difference between the new maximum of `a` and the new minimum of `b`, in addition to the original absolute difference between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`.
