Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is equal to m, a is a list of m integers, b is an empty list, result is a list with m elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that `m` remains an integer, `n` remains at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` becomes equal to `m`, `a` remains a list of `m` integers, `b` becomes an empty list because all its elements have been removed, and `result` becomes a list with `m` elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`.
