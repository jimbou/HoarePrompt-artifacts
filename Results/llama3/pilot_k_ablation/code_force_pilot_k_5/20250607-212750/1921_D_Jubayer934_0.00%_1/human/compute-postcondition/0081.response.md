Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 integer, `b` is a sorted list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The integer `m` and the value of `n` which is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2 remain the same. The value of `i` is still 0. The list `a` still contains `m` integers with at least one integer, and the sorted list `b` still contains `n` integers. The list `result` is still empty.
