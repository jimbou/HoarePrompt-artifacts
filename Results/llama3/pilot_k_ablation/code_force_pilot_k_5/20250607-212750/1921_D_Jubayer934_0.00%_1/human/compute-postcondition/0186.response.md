The code snippet provided modifies the initial state by executing three lines of code. Here's the combined effect of all lines on the program:

The first line appends the absolute difference between the maximum value in list `a` and the minimum value in list `b` to the `result` list. Since `a` contains at least 4 integers and `b` contains `n-4` integers, the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` are used for the calculation.

The second line removes the maximum value from list `a`, reducing the number of elements in `a` by 1.

The third line removes the minimum value from list `b`, reducing the number of elements in `b` by 1.

Considering the initial state and the modifications made by the code, the final output state is:

Output State: **m is at least 3, n is an integer, i is 4, a is a list of at least 3 integers, b is a list of n-5 integers, result is a list containing 5 integers**

In this final state, the value of `m` remains unchanged, as it is not affected by the code. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains 4, as it is not affected by the code. The list `a` now contains at least 3 integers, as the maximum value was removed. The list `b` now contains `n-5` integers, as the minimum value was removed. The `result` list now contains 5 integers, as the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` was appended to it.
