The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 1 integer the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a list of m-1 integers, i is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least m integers and the index is 1.
State: **m is an integer, n is an integer, i is 1, a is a list of m integers, b is a list of n-1 integers, result is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the maximum integer in the original list a and the minimum integer in the original list b, stdin is empty**
