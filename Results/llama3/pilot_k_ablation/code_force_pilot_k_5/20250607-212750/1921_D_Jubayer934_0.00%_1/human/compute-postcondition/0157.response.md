The code `break` is executed, which means we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement. The values of the variables `m`, `n`, `i`, `a`, `b`, and `result` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the loop or conditional statement.

Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer and equals `m`, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
