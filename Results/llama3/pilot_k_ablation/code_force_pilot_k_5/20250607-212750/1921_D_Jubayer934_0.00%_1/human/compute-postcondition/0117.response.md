To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `a`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `a` has at least one element. Since `i` is used as the loop variable, it should be initialized to the first index of `a`, which is 0.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m` integers, `result` is an empty list, the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed**
