Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is equal to m, a is an empty list, b is a sorted list of n-m integers, result is a list containing m integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum, and so on, until the maximum of a after removing its maximum m-1 times and the minimum of b after removing its minimum m-1 times.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the value of `i` will be equal to the length of list `a` (which is `m`), and list `a` will be empty as all its elements have been removed. List `b` will have `n-m` integers left, as `m` elements have been removed from it. The list `result` will contain `m` integers, each of which is the absolute difference between the maximum of `a` and the minimum of `b` at each iteration. The other variables remain unchanged.
