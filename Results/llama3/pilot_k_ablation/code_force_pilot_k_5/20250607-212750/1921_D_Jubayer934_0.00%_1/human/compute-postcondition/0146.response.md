To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(len(a)):`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2 and less than `m`, and `a` is a list of at least 1 integers.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is at least 3 and less than `m`. The length of `a` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `m`, `n`, `b`, and `result` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is at least 3 and less than `m`, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list with at least 1 elements, `result` is a list with three elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`.**
