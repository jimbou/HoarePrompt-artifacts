To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in range(len(a)):`. This means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of `a`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is at least 0 and less than `m`, and `a` is a list of `m-1` integers.

To execute the loop again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes at least 1 and less than `m`. The length of `a` remains the same, which is `m-1`.

The other variables `m`, `n`, `b`, and `result` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain unchanged.

State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is at least 1 and less than `m`, `a` is a list of `m-1` integers, `b` is a list with one less element, `result` is a list with one element which is the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`.**
