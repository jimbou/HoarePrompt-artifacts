Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `n-1` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` equals the length of `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is decreased by 1, and the last element of list `b` is removed. The values of the other variables are not affected. The condition of breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on whether the length of `a` equals the length of `b`.
