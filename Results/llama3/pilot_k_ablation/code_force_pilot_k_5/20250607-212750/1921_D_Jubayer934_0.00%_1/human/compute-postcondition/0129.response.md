Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-3` integers, `result` is an empty list, the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to be a sorted list of `n-m-3` integers, as one element has been removed from the list. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still dependent on the lengths of `a` and `b`.
