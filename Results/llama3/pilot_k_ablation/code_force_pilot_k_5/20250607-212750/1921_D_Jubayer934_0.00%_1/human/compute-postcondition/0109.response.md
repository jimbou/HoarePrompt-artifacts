Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 3, a is a list of at least 2 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-4 integers, result is a list containing 4 integers which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b, the new maximum of a and the new minimum of b, the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum, and the maximum of a after removing its maximum and the minimum of b after removing its minimum.**

In this output state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains the same, being at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` is still 3. The list `a` now contains at least 2 integers, as one integer has been removed from it. The list `b` is now a sorted list of `n-m-4` integers, as one integer has been removed from it. The list `result` now contains 4 integers, which are the absolute differences between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`, the new maximum of `a` and the new minimum of `b`, the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum, and the maximum of `a` after removing its maximum and the minimum of `b` after removing its minimum.
