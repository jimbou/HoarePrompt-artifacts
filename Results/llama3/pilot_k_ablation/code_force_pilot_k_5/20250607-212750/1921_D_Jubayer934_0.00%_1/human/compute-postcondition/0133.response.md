Output State: **`m` is an integer, `n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-4` integers, `result` is an empty list, the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, being at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` is still 3. The list `a` remains unchanged with `m` integers, having at least 3 elements. The list `b` has been modified by removing its last element, now having `n-m-4` integers and is still sorted. The list `result` is still empty and the sum of the absolute differences in the result list is not being printed. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
