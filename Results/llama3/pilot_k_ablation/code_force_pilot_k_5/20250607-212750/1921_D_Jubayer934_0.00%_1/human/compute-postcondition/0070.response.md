According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of `m-3` integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `a` must have at least 3 integers.
State: **`n` is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is 3, `m` is at least 4, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, n - len(a)) integers, `result` is a list containing 3 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the original list a and the minimum value in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b, the third integer is the absolute difference between the maximum value in the updated list a and the minimum value in the updated list b.**
