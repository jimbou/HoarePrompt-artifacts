Output State: **`n` is at least 1 and is equal to half of its original value, `i` is 3, `m` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a sorted list of `n-3` integers, `result` is an empty list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `i`, `m`, `a`, `b`, and `result` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or conditional statement that we were directly inside. All other conditions and variable values remain the same as in the initial state.
