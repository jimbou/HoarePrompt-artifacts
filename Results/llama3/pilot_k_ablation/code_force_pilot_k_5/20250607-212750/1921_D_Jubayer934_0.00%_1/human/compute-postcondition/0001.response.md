According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, n is an integer between 1 and 2⋅10^5 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and the third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9). So for the loop to be executed  the n is at least 1 and i is now 0.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases, each test case contains two lines: the second line contains n integers a_i (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) and the third line contains m integers b_i (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9)**
