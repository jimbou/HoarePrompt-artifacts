Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 0.5 and is equal to a quarter of its original value, `i` is at least 2 and less than `len(a)`, `m` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `b` is a sorted list of max(0, `n` - `len(a)` - 2) integers, `result` is an empty list. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
