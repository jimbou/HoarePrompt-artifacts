Output State: **m is an integer, n is an integer, i is 1, a is a list of m-1 integers, b is a list of n-2 integers, result is a list containing 2 integers, the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum integer in the original list a and the minimum integer in the original list b, the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum integer in the updated list a and the minimum integer in the updated list b, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the value of `m` and `n` remains unchanged as they are not modified by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `a` now contains `m-1` integers because the maximum integer from the original list `a` has been removed. Similarly, the list `b` now contains `n-2` integers because the minimum integer from the original list `b` has been removed. The list `result` now contains two integers: the first integer is the absolute difference between the maximum integer in the original list `a` and the minimum integer in the original list `b`, and the second integer is the absolute difference between the maximum integer in the updated list `a` and the minimum integer in the updated list `b`. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
