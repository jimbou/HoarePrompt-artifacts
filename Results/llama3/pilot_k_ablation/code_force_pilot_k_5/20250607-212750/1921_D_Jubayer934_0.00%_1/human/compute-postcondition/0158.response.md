Postcondition: ***`m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of `m` integers that must have at least 1 element, `b` is a list of `n` integers, `result` is an empty list, and `stdin` is empty. If the length of `a` equals the length of `b`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
