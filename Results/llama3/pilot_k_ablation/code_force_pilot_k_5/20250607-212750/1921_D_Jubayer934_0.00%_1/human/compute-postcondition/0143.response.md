Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 1 and less than m, a is a list of m-2 integers, b is a list with two less elements, result is a list with two elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.**

In this output state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, being at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` remains at least 1 and less than `m`. The list `a` now contains `m-2` integers, having removed the maximum value. The list `b` also has two less elements, having removed the minimum value. The list `result` now contains two elements, which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b`.
