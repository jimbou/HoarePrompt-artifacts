Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is at least 2 and less than m, a is a list of at least 1 integers, b is a list with at least 1 elements, result is a list with three elements which are the absolute differences between the maximum value in a and the minimum value in b.**

The code block modifies the lists `a` and `b` and the list `result`. The first line appends the absolute difference between the maximum value in `a` and the minimum value in `b` to the list `result`. The second line removes the maximum value from the list `a`, and the third line removes the minimum value from the list `b`. The values of `m`, `n`, and `i` are not affected by the code.
