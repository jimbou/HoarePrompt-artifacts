Output State: **m is an integer, n is at least 0.25 and is equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2, i is 0, a is a list of at least 0 integers, b is a sorted list of n-m-1 integers, result is a list containing 1 integer which is the absolute difference between the original maximum of a and the original minimum of b**

In this output state, the value of `m` remains unchanged as an integer. The value of `n` also remains unchanged, being at least 0.25 and equal to a quarter of its original value divided by 2. The value of `i` remains 0. The list `a` has at least 0 integers, as the maximum value has been removed. The list `b` is a sorted list of `n-m-1` integers, as the minimum value has been removed. The list `result` contains 1 integer, which is the absolute difference between the original maximum of `a` and the original minimum of `b`.
