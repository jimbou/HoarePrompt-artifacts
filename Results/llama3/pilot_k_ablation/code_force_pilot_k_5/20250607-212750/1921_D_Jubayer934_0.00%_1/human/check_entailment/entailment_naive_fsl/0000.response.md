Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is:

3 4
1 1 1
1 1 1 1

The program will output 0, but the correct output should be 0 because the maximum difference D that can be obtained is indeed 0.

However, if the input is:

2 6
5 8
8 7 5 8 2 10

The program will output 11, but the correct output should be 12. The program is not correctly implementing the logic to maximize the difference D.

The issue lies in the way the program is removing elements from the lists a and b. The program is removing the maximum element from a and the minimum element from b, but this is not the correct approach to maximize the difference D. The correct approach would be to remove the elements that would result in the maximum difference.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not work as expected for all potential cases.
