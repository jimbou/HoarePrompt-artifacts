Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle all cases. For example, when the input is 3 3, the program will print 'no', but actually, Bob can cut the rectangle into two 3 x 1.5 rectangles and then form a 1.5 x 6 rectangle, which is different from the original 3 x 3 rectangle.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if the sides of the rectangle are even or odd, but it does not consider the case where the sides are odd and the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides. 

To fix this, the program should also check if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two sides is greater than 1. If the GCD is greater than 1, then the rectangle can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides, and Bob can form another rectangle. 

Here is an example of how the corrected program could look:

```python
import math

def func():
    for i in range(int(input())):
        (a, b) = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        if a == b:
            print('no')
        elif math.gcd(a, b) > 1:
            print('yes')
        elif a % 2 == 0 and a / 2 != b or (b % 2 == 0 and b / 2 != a):
            print('yes')
        else:
            print('no')
```

This corrected program will correctly handle all cases and print the correct output.
