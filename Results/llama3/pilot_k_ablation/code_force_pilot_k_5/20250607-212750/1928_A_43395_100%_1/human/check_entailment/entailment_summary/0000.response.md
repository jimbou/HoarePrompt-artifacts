Reasoning:
The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine if a rectangle can be divided into two equal smaller rectangles. The program checks if either the length or width of the rectangle is even, and if the other dimension is not equal to half of the even dimension. If this condition is met, it prints 'yes', indicating that the rectangle can be divided into two equal smaller rectangles. Otherwise, it prints 'no'. This logic is consistent with the problem description and the provided example cases.

Correctness: **True**
