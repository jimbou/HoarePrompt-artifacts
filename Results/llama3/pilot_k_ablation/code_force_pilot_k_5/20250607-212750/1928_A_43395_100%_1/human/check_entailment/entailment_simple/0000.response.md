Reasoning:

The given program is designed to determine if a rectangle of size a x b can be cut into two rectangles with integer sides and then rearranged to form a different rectangle. The program iterates over multiple test cases, each containing two integers a and b representing the size of the rectangle.

The program's logic is based on the following conditions:

1. If both a and b are even, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

2. If a is even and a/2 is not equal to b, or if b is even and b/2 is not equal to a, it prints 'yes' because the rectangle can be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

3. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'no' because the rectangle cannot be cut into two smaller rectangles with integer sides and rearranged to form a different rectangle.

The program's logic is correct based on the problem description. It correctly handles all possible cases and prints the expected output for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
