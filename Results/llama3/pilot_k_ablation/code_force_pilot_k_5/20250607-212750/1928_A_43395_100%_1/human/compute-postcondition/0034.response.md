To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

The loop head is `for i in range(int(input())):`. The key elements here are `i` and the value returned by `int(input())`, which represents the number of test cases.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and there are multiple test cases minus one left in `stdin`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and there must be at least one more test case in `stdin`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 3 (incremented by 1)
* `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus two (since one test case has been processed)

The states of `a` and `b` are not relevant to the loop head, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus two.**
