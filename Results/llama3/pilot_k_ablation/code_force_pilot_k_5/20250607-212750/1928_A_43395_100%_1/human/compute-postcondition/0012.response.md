Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either `a` is odd, or `b` is odd, or both `a` and `b` are odd. If `a` is even and `a / 2` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b / 2` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is even and `a / 2` is equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and `b / 2` is equal to `a`, then 'no' is printed.***
