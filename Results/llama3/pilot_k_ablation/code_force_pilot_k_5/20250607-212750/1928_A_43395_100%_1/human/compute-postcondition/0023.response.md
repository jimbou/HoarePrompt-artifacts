Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. If both `a` and `b` are even, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if either `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. In all other cases, 'no' is printed.***
