To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head, which are `i` and the input from `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, and `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus three. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, and there must be at least one more test case in `stdin`.

State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus four.**
