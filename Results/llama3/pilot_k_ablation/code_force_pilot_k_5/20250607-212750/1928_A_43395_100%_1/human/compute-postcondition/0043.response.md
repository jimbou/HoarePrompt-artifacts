Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus three. If both `a` and `b` are even, 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, if `a` is even and half of `a` is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even and half of `b` is not equal to `a`, then 'yes' is printed. Otherwise, 'no' is printed.***
