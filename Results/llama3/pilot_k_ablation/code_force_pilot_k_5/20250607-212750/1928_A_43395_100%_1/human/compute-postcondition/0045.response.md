Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers from the input, which was a space-separated list of integers. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 4. The stdin now contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
