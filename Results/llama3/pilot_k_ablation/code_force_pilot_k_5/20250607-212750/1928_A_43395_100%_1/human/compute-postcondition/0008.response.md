Output: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Either `a` is odd, or `b` is odd, or both `a` and `b` are odd. The current value of `a` and `b` is such that if `a` is even, `a` divided by 2 is not equal to `b`, or if `b` is even, `b` divided by 2 is not equal to `a`, and 'yes' is printed**
