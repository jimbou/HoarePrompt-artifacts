Output State: **`i` is equal to the number of test cases, stdin is empty.**

The loop will execute until all test cases in stdin have been processed. After the loop finishes, the value of `i` will be equal to the number of test cases, and stdin will be empty because all test cases have been read and processed. The values of `a` and `b` will be the values from the last test case, but they are not relevant to the output state because the loop has finished executing.
