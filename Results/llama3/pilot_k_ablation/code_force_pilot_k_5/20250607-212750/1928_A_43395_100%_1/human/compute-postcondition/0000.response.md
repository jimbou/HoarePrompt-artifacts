The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and input(), so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the input(). If the input() is at least 1, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, stdin contains multiple test cases. So for the loop to be executed  the input() must be at least 1 and the i is 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, input() must be at least 1, i is 0**
