Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one**.

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are assigned the integers from the input, where `input().split()` accepts a space-separated list of integers and `[int(i) for i in ...]` converts them to integers. The stdin contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been consumed by the `input()` function. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 0.
