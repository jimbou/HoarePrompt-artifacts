Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `i` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

In this output state, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to be the two integers input from the standard input, which was previously containing multiple test cases minus two. The value of `i` remains unchanged at 2. The standard input now contains multiple test cases minus one, as one test case has been consumed by the input operation.
