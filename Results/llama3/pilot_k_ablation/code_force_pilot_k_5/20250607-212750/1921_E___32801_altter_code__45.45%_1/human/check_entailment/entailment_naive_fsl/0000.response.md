Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when Alice's chip is in the last row and Bob's chip is in the first row, but they are not in the same column. In this case, the program should output "Draw", but it does not.

For example, if the input is:

10 10 10 5 1 3

The program will output "Alice", but the correct output should be "Draw" because Alice cannot move her chip to the first row and Bob cannot move his chip to the last row.

The program only checks if Alice's chip is in the last row or Bob's chip is in the first row, but it does not check if they are in the same column. Therefore, it does not handle this specific case correctly.
