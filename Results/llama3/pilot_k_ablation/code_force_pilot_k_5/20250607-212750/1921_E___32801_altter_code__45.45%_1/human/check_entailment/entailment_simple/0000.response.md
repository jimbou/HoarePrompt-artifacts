Reasoning: The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine the outcome of the game based on the initial positions of Alice's and Bob's chips. The program checks the conditions for Alice's and Bob's wins, and if neither condition is met, it prints "Draw". The program also correctly handles the cases where the difference between x2 and x1 is odd or even, and where y1 is equal to or not equal to y2. The program's logic is consistent with the problem description, and it does not contain any syntax errors or logical flaws.

Correctness: **True**
