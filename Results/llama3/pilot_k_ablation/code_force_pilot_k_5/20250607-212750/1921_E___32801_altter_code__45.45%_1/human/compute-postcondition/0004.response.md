Output State: **The program returns nothing, as the return statement is empty. The current state of the variables remains unchanged, with 'n' being an integer between 1 and 10^6, 'm' being an integer between 1 and 10^9, 'x1' being an integer between 1 and 'n', 'y1' being an integer between 1 and 'm', 'x2' being an integer between 1 and 'n' and less than or equal to 'x1', 'y2' being an integer between 1 and 'm', and 'r' being a list of six integers. Additionally, 'draw' is still printed, and the stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
