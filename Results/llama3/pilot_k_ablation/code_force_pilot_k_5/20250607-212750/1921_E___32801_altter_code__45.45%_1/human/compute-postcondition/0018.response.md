Functionality: **Determines the winner of a game based on the input coordinates and prints the result. The function takes no arguments and uses the input from the standard input. It reads six space-separated integers representing the height, width, and coordinates of two points. If the x-coordinates are equal, it prints 'draw'. If the difference between the x-coordinates is odd, it prints 'Alice' if the y-coordinates are equal, otherwise, it prints 'bob'. If the difference between the x-coordinates is even, it prints 'bob' if the y-coordinates are equal, otherwise, it prints 'Alice'. The function returns no value and modifies no external state, only printing the result to the standard output.**
