Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^6, m is an integer between 1 and 10^9, x1 is an integer between 1 and n, y1 is an integer between 1 and m, x2 is an integer between 1 and n, y2 is an integer between 1 and m, r is a list of six integers, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains six space-separated integers, and assigns them to the variables n, m, x1, y1, x2, and y2. The values of these variables are constrained by the problem statement, with n and m being the larger bounds and x1, y1, x2, and y2 being the smaller values within those bounds. The list r is created to hold these six integers. After this code executes, stdin will contain one fewer test case.
