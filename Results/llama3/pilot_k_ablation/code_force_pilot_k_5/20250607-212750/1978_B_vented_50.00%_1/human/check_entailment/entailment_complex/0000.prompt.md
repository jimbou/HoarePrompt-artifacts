Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains multiple lines of input. The first line contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 10^4) representing the number of test cases. Each of the following t lines contains three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9) representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively.
    t = int(input())
    while t:
        x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
        
        n = x[0]
        
        a = x[1]
        
        b = x[2]
        
        profit = n * a
        
        if a >= b:
            print(profit)
        else:
            k = b - a
            k = min(n - 1, k)
            profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
            print(int(profit))
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is 0, stdin is empty, x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the integer value of profit is being printed. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n * a is being printed. Otherwise, the profit which is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2 is being printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads multiple lines of input from stdin, where the first line contains the number of test cases (t) and each subsequent line contains three integers (n, a, b) representing the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price, respectively. It then calculates the profit for each test case based on the given prices and prints the result. If the usual price (a) is greater than or equal to the modified price (b), the profit is simply the product of the number of buns (n) and the usual price (a). Otherwise, the profit is calculated using the formula: n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2. The function continues to process test cases until all input has been read (i.e., t becomes 0).
