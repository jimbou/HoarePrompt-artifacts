Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the integer value of profit is equal to n * a.**

In this output state, the value of t remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains t - 1 lines of input because one line has been read and processed. The list x now contains the three integers n, a, and b, which are all between 1 and 10^9. The variables n, a, and b have been assigned the values from the input line. The variable profit has been calculated as n * a, which is an integer value.
