The code prints the integer value of `profit`, which is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - (min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) / 2`. This value is an integer representation of the profit, which is a result of the given formula.

Output: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - (min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) / 2, k is an integer equal to min(n - 1, b - a), and the integer value of profit is being printed**
