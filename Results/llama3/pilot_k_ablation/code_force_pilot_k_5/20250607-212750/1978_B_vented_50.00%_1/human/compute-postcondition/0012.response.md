The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to the product of n and a is being printed. If a is less than b, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and the integer value of profit is being printed.**
