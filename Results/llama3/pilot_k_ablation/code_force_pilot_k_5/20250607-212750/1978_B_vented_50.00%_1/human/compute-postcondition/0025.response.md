Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - (min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) / 2, k is an integer equal to min(n - 1, b - a)**

The code executes three lines that affect the variables `k` and `profit`. The first line assigns the value of `b - a` to `k`. The second line updates the value of `k` to be the minimum between `n - 1` and the current value of `k`. The third line updates the value of `profit` by adding the product of `(b - a)` and `(k + 1)`, and then subtracting the product of `k` and `(k + 1)` divided by 2. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
