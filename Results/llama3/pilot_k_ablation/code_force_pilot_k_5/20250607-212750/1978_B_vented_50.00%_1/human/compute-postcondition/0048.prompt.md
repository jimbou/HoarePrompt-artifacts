Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)
Code of the loop:
while t:
    x = list(map(int, input().split(' ')))
    n = x[0]
    a = x[1]
    b = x[2]
    profit = n * a
    if a >= b:
        print(profit)
    else:
        k = b - a
        k = min(n - 1, k)
        profit = profit + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2
        print(int(profit))
    t -= 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to the product of n and a is being printed. If a is less than b, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and the integer value of profit is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n * a is being printed. Otherwise, the profit which is equal to the product of n and a plus the sum of the first k positive integers where k is the minimum of n - 1 and b - a is printed.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n * a is being printed. Otherwise, the profit which is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - (min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) / 2 is being printed.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the integer value of profit is being printed. If a >= b, then profit is equal to n * a. Otherwise, profit is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, where k is an integer equal to min(n - 1, b - a).
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 3, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the integer value of profit, which is equal to n * a, is printed. Otherwise, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 1 and b - a, and the integer value of profit, which is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2, is printed.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
