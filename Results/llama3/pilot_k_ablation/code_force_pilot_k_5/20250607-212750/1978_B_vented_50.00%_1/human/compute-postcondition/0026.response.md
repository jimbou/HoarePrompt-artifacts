The code prints the value of `profit`, which is an integer calculated based on the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`. 

`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `b` is an integer between 1 and 10^9. 

The `profit` is calculated as `n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - (min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) / 2`, where `min(n - 1, b - a)` is the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`. 

Since the exact values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `profit`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the calculated profit.

Output: **profit (where profit is the calculated profit based on the values of n, a, and b)**
