Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a.**

The code reads a line from stdin, which contains three space-separated integers n, a, and b. These values are assigned to the list x. Then, the values of n, a, and b are extracted from the list x and assigned to the variables n, a, and b, respectively. The variable profit is calculated as the product of n and a. The value of t is not affected by the code, and stdin now contains t - 1 lines of input. The variables n, a, and b have new values, and the variable profit has a value equal to the product of n and a.
