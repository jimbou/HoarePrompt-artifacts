Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**

In this output state, the variable `t` has been assigned the value of the first line of input, which is an integer between 1 and 10^4. The stdin now contains `t` lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `a`, and `b` are all between 1 and 10^9.
