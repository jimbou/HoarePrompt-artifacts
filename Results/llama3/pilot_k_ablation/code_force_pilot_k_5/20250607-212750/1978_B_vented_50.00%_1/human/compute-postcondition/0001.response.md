To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition, which is `while t:`. This loop will execute as long as `t` is not zero.

Given that `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, we can see that `t` is already guaranteed to be greater than zero. Therefore, no adjustments to the state of `t` are necessary for the loop to execute the first time.

The state of `stdin` containing `t` lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, does not affect the loop condition directly. The loop condition only depends on the value of `t`.

Therefore, the state right before the loop does not need any adjustments for the loop to execute the first time.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9)**
