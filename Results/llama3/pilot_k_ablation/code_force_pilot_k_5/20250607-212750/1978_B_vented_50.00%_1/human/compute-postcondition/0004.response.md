The code prints the value of `profit`, which is the product of `n` and `a`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, the product `profit` will be an integer between 1 and 10^18.

Output: **n * a (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
