Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to n * a.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The stdin now contains `t - 1` lines of input because one line has been read and processed by the code. The list `x` now contains three integers, which are the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` read from the first line of stdin. The variables `n`, `a`, and `b` have been assigned the values from the first line of stdin, and `profit` has been calculated as the product of `n` and `a`.
