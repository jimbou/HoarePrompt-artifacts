Based on the initial state, the code `print(profit)` will print the value of the variable `profit`.

The variable `profit` is defined as an integer equal to `n * a`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `a` is an integer between 1 and 10^9.

Since the exact values of `n` and `a` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `profit`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the product of `n` and `a`.

Output: **n * a (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
