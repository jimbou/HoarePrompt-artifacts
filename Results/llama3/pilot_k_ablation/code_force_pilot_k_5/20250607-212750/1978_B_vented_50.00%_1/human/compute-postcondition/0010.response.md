Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4, stdin contains t-1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to the product of n and a is being printed. If a is less than b, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and the integer value of profit is being printed.***
