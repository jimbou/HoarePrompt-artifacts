Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the integer value of profit is being printed. If a >= b, then profit is equal to n * a. Otherwise, profit is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, where k is an integer equal to min(n - 1, b - a).**

The code decrements the value of t by 1. The value of t was initially between 1 and 10^4 - 2, so after decrementing, it will be between 1 and 10^4 - 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
