Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 1, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to the product of n and a is being printed. If a is less than b, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a plus (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, and the integer value of profit is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of t has been decremented by 1, and the number of lines of input in stdin has also been decremented by 1. The values of x, n, a, b, and profit remain the same as before, and the conditions for printing the profit also remain the same.
