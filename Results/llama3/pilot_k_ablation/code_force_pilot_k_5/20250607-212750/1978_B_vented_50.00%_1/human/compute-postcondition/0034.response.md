Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, k is an integer equal to min(n - 1, b - a)**

The code first calculates the difference between `b` and `a` and assigns it to `k`. Then, it limits `k` to be at most `n - 1` by taking the minimum of `n - 1` and `k`. Finally, it updates the `profit` by adding the product of `b - a` and `k + 1`, and subtracting the sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. The value of `k` is also updated to be the minimum of `n - 1` and `b - a`. The values of `t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
