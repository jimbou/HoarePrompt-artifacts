Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, profit is an integer equal to the product of n and a plus the sum of the first k positive integers where k is the minimum of n - 1 and b - a, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 1 and b - a.**

The code modifies the values of `k` and `profit`. The first line assigns the difference between `b` and `a` to `k`. The second line ensures that `k` is not greater than `n - 1` by assigning the minimum of `n - 1` and `k` back to `k`. The third line updates `profit` by adding the product of `b - a` and `k + 1`, then subtracting the sum of the first `k` positive integers (calculated as `k * (k + 1) / 2`). The other variables (`t`, `x`, `n`, `a`, `b`, and the contents of `stdin`) remain unchanged.
