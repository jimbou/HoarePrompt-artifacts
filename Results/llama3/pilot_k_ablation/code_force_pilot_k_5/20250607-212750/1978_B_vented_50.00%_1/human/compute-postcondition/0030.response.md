According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, which means `t` is at least 1. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9.**
