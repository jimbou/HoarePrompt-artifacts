Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 1, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n * a is being printed. Otherwise, the profit which is equal to the product of n and a plus the sum of the first k positive integers where k is the minimum of n - 1 and b - a is printed.***
