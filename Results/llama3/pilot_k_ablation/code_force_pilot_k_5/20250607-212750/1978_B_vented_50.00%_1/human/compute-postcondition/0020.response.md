Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n * a is being printed. Otherwise, the profit which is equal to the product of n and a plus the sum of the first k positive integers where k is the minimum of n - 1 and b - a is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: the value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and the rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin now contains `t` lines of input instead of `t-1` lines.
