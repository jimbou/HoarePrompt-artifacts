Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the profit which is equal to n * a is being printed. Otherwise, the profit which is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - (min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1)) / 2 is being printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` has been decremented by 1, and the number of lines in the standard input has been reduced by 1. The ranges of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain the same. The profit calculation remains the same, depending on whether `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
