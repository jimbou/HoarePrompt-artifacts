The code prints the value of the variable `profit`, which is an integer equal to the product of `n` and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `a` is also an integer between 1 and 10^9.

Output: **n * a (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
