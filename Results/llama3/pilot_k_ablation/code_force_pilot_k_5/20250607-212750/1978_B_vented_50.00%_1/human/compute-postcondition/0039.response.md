The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 3, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 - 2, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and the integer value of profit is being printed. If a >= b, then profit is equal to n * a. Otherwise, profit is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) - min(n - 1, b - a) * (min(n - 1, b - a) + 1) / 2, where k is an integer equal to min(n - 1, b - a).**
