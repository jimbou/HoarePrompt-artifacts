Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 - 3, stdin contains t lines of input, each line containing three space-separated integers n, a, and b (1 <= n, a, b <= 10^9), x is a list of three integers, n is an integer between 1 and 10^9, a is an integer between 1 and 10^9, b is an integer between 1 and 10^9. If a is greater than or equal to b, the integer value of profit, which is equal to n * a, is printed. Otherwise, stdin contains t - 1 lines of input, k is an integer equal to the minimum of n - 1 and b - a, and the integer value of profit, which is equal to n * a + (b - a) * (k + 1) - k * (k + 1) / 2, is printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of t has been decreased by 1, and the number of lines of input in stdin has also been decreased by 1. The ranges of the values of t, n, a, and b remain the same. The value of x is still a list of three integers. The conditions for printing the profit value also remain the same.
