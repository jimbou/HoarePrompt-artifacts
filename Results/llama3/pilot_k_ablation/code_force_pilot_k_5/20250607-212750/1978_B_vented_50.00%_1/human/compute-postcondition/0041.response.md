The code prints the value of the variable `profit`, which is equal to the product of the variables `n` and `a`. 
Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^9, and `a` is also an integer between 1 and 10^9, the value of `profit` will be the product of these two integers.
Output: **n * a (where n is an integer between 1 and 10^9 and a is an integer between 1 and 10^9)**
