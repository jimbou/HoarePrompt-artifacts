#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list contains test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the xth test case from the list b, where x is an integer between 1 and 5000, and the test case is a list containing the number of operations, the number of queries, the operations themselves, and the queries. The operations are lists of two integers, where the first integer is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x between 1 and n or the number of copies x between 1 and 10^9. The queries are a list of q integers.

    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: x is an integer between 1 and the last element in list a (inclusive), a is a list that must have at least t elements, i is the last element in a, b is a list. If x is in b, the program returns the element at index x in list b. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function retrieves a test case from a list based on a given index. It first checks if the index is in a dictionary (b) and returns the corresponding test case if found. If not, it iterates through a list (a) and updates the index using a modulo operation until it finds a matching index in the dictionary or reaches the end of the list. If a match is found, it returns the test case; otherwise, it does not return anything. The function accepts an integer index and lists a and b as inputs and returns a test case or nothing.
