Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Jayden has an array a which is initially empty. There are n operations of two
types he must perform in the given order.

  1. Jayden appends an integer x (1 \leq x \leq n ) to the end of array a . 
  2. Jayden appends x copies of array a to the end of array a . In other words, array a becomes [a,\underbrace{a,\ldots,a}_{x}] . It is guaranteed that he has done at least one operation of the first type before this. 

Jayden has q queries. For each query, you must tell him the k -th element of
array a . The elements of the array are numbered from 1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 5000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n, q
\leq 10^5 ) — the number of operations and the number of queries.

The following n lines describe the operations. Each line contains two integers
b and x (b \in \\{1, 2\\} ), where b denotes the type of operation. If b=1 ,
then x (1 \leq x \leq n ) is the integer Jayden appends to the end of the
array. If b=2 , then x (1 \leq x \leq 10^9 ) is the number of copies Jayden
appends to the end of the array.

The next line of each test case contains q integers k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_q (1
\leq k_i \leq \min(10^{18}, c) ), which denote the queries, where c is the
size of the array after finishing all n operations.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of q over all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output q integers — answers to Jayden's queries.

Note

In the first test case:

  * After the first operation a = [1] ;
  * After the second operation a = [1, 2] ;
  * After the third operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2] ;
  * After the fourth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3] ;
  * After the fifth operation a = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3] .

In the fourth test case, after all operations a = [1, 2] .

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a list of integers, where the first element is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list contains test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries.
    x = int(x)
    if (x in b) :
        return b[x]
        #The program returns the xth test case from the list b, where x is an integer between 1 and 5000, and the test case is a list containing the number of operations, the number of queries, the operations themselves, and the queries. The operations are lists of two integers, where the first integer is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x between 1 and n or the number of copies x between 1 and 10^9. The queries are a list of q integers.
    #State: x is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list contains test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries. Additionally, x is not in b.
    for i in a:
        x = (x - 1) % i + 1
        
        if x in b:
            return b[x]
        
    #State: x is an integer between 1 and the last element in list a (inclusive), a is a list that must have at least t elements, i is the last element in a, b is a list. If x is in b, the program returns the element at index x in list b. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function retrieves a test case from a list based on a given index. It first checks if the index is in a dictionary (b) and returns the corresponding test case if found. If not, it iterates through a list (a) and updates the index using a modulo operation until it finds a matching index in the dictionary or reaches the end of the list. If a match is found, it returns the test case; otherwise, it does not return anything. The function accepts an integer index and lists a and b as inputs and returns a test case or nothing.
