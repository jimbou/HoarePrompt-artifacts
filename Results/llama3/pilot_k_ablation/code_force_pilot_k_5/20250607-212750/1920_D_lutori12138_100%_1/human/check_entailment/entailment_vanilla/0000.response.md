Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining the k-th element of array a after a series of operations. The program uses a list a to keep track of the size of the array after each operation, and a dictionary b to store the values appended to the array.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the program's logic:

1. The program iterates over the range of the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, it initializes an empty list a and an empty dictionary b.
3. It reads the number of operations (c) and the number of queries (d) for the current test case.
4. It iterates over the range of the number of operations. For each operation:
   - If the operation is of type 1 (append an integer), it increments the last element of list a by 1 and stores the appended value in dictionary b with the current size of the array as the key.
   - If the operation is of type 2 (append x copies of the array), it appends a new element to list a, which is the current size of the array multiplied by (x + 1).
   - If the size of the array exceeds 10^19, it skips the remaining operations.
5. After all operations are processed, it reverses list a.
6. It reads the queries for the current test case and applies the resolve_query function to each query.
7. The resolve_query function (defined as func_1 in the program) takes a query x and returns the k-th element of the array. It does this by:
   - If x is in dictionary b, it returns the value stored in b for x.
   - Otherwise, it iterates over the reversed list a. For each size i in a, it calculates the remainder of (x - 1) divided by i, adds 1 to the result, and checks if this value is in dictionary b. If it is, it returns the value stored in b.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
