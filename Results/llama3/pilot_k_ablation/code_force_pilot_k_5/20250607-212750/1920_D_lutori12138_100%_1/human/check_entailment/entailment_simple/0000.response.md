Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It iterates over each test case, processes the operations, and then resolves the queries.

The program correctly handles the two types of operations:

1.  Appending an integer `x` to the end of the array `a`.
2.  Appending `x` copies of the array `a` to the end of the array `a`.

The program uses a dictionary `b` to store the values of the elements in the array `a` and their corresponding indices. This allows for efficient lookup of the elements during the query resolution process.

The program also uses a list `a` to store the sizes of the array after each operation. This list is reversed at the end to facilitate the query resolution process.

The `resolve_query` function is not defined in the provided code snippet, but based on the context, it is likely a recursive function that resolves the queries by finding the corresponding element in the array `a` using the dictionary `b` and the list `a`.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
