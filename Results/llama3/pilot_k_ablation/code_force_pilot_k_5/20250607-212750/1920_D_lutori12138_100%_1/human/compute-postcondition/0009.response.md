The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 1 element, i is the first element in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in the list.
State: **`x` is an integer between 1 and `i` (inclusive), `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the second element in `a`, and `x` is not in `b`**
