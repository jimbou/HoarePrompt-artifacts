Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer between 1 and the third element in `a` (inclusive), `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `a`, `b` is a list. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.***
