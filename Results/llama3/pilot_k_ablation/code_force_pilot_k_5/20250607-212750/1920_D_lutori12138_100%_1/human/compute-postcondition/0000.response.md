Output State: **x is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list contains test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries.**

In this output state, the variable x has been converted to an integer, but its value is still within the range of 1 to 5000, representing the number of test cases. The rest of the list remains unchanged, containing test cases with their respective operations and queries.
