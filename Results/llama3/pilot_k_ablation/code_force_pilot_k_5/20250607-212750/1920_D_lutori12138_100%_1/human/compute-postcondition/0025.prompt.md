Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: x is an integer t (1 <= t <= 5000) representing the number of test cases, and the rest of the list contains test cases. Each test case is a list of integers, where the first two elements are integers n and q (1 <= n, q <= 10^5) representing the number of operations and the number of queries, respectively. The next n elements are lists of two integers each, representing the operations. The first integer in each operation is either 1 or 2, and the second integer is either an integer x (1 <= x <= n) or the number of copies x (1 <= x <= 10^9). The last element of the test case is a list of q integers, representing the queries. Additionally, x is not in b.
Code of the loop:
for i in a:
    x = (x - 1) % i + 1
    if x in b:
        return b[x]


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`x` is an integer between 1 and `i` (inclusive), `a` is a list that must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `x` is not in `b`

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and the second element of list `a` (inclusive), `a` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, and `i` is the second element in `a`. If `x` is in list `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and the third element in `a` (inclusive), `a` is a list that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in `a`, `b` is a list. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and the fourth element in `a` (inclusive), `a` is a list that must have at least 4 elements, `i` is the fourth element in `a`, `b` is a list. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`x` is an integer between 1 and the fifth element in `a` (inclusive), `a` is a list that must have at least 5 elements, `i` is the fifth element in `a`, `b` is a list. If `x` is in `b`, the program returns the element at index `x` in list `b`.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
