Output State: **x is an integer between 1 and the last element in list a (inclusive), a is a list that must have at least t elements, i is the last element in a, b is a list. If x is in b, the program returns the element at index x in list b. Otherwise, the program does not return anything.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of x will be between 1 and the last element in list a (inclusive). The list a must have at least t elements, where t is the number of test cases. The variable i will be the last element in list a. The list b remains unchanged. If x is in list b, the program will return the element at index x in list b. If x is not in list b, the program will not return anything.
