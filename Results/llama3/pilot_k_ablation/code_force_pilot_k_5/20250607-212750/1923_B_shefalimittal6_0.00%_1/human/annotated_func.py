#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains three inputs: first two space-separated integers n and k, then a space-separated list of n integers, and finally a space-separated list of n integers. The integer n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, and the integers in the lists are non-negative integers.
    try:
        n, k = map(int, input().split())
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        b = [0] * (n + 1)

                print('NO')
                return

        #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `abs(x)` is incremented by the value of `a` at index `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, `x` is an integer, `r` is equal to `k * n`. If `r` is less than `b[i]`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `abs(x)` is incremented by the value of `a` at index `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, `x` is an integer, `r` is equal to `k * n`. If `r` is less than `b[i]`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed. If a `ValueError` occurs, the state is unknown and 'Invalid input format' is printed.

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads input from stdin, expecting a specific format: two space-separated integers (n and k) followed by two lists of n space-separated integers. It then processes the input, accumulating values in a list b based on the absolute values of the second list. The function checks if the accumulated value r (initialized to 0 and incremented by k for each iteration) is less than the value in list b at each index i. If r is less than b[i] at any point, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' if the input is valid. If the input format is invalid, it catches the ValueError exception and prints 'Invalid input format'.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (t) representing the number of test cases.
    try:
        t = int(input())
        for _ in range(t):
            func_1()
            
        #State: `t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `t`, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.
    except (ValueError):
        print('Invalid input format')
        #This is printed: Invalid input format
    #State: The program either executes the function `func_1()` `t` times if the input is a valid integer, or prints "Invalid input format" if the input is not a valid integer.

#Overall this is what the function does:Reads an integer from standard input representing the number of test cases, attempts to execute a separate function (`func_1`) that number of times, and handles invalid input by printing an error message if the input is not a valid integer.
