To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states accordingly.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only variable in the loop head is `t`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current iteration number, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 3, and the function `func_1()` has been executed six times. Since the loop has executed six times, the current iteration number is 6. For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 6.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 6, and the function `func_1()` has been executed six times**
