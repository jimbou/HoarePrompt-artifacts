The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 3, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `abs(x)` is incremented by the value of `a` at index `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4, `x` is an integer, `r` is equal to `k + k + k`. If `r` is less than `b[i]`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.**
