Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `t`, and the function `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.**

This output state means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` remains unchanged, and the function `func_1()` has been executed a number of times equal to the initial value of `t`.
