Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 3, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `abs(x)` is incremented by the value of `a` at index `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4, `x` is an integer, `r` is equal to `k + k + k + k`. If `r` is less than `b[i]`, then 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, no output is produced.***
