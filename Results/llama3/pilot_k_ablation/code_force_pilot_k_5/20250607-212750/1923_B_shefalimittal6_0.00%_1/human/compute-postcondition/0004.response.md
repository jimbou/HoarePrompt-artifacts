Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed twice.**

The code snippet simply calls the function `func_1()` again, without modifying any variables or introducing new ones. Since the function has already been executed once in the initial state, the output state reflects that it has now been executed twice. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as there is no operation performed on it.
