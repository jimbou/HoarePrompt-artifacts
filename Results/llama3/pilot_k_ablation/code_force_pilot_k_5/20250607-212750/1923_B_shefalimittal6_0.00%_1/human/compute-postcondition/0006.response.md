Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed four times**

The code executes the function `func_1()` once. Since the function has already been executed three times in the initial state, the total number of executions is now four. The value of `t` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. Therefore, the output state is that `t` is still a positive integer greater than 2, and the function `func_1()` has been executed four times.
