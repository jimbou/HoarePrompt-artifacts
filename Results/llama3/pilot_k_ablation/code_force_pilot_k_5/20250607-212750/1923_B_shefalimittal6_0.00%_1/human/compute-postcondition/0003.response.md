The only variable in the loop head is `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 1, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**
