Output State: **`t` is a positive integer greater than 0, and the function `func_1()` has been executed.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not modified by the code. The code only calls the function `func_1()`, which means that the function has been executed, but its effects on the program state are not specified. Therefore, the output state only mentions that the function has been executed, without providing any additional information about its effects.
