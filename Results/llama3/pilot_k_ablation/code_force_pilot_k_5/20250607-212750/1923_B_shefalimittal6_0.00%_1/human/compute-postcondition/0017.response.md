Output: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `k` is a non-negative integer, `a` is a list of `n` non-negative integers, `b` is a list of `n+1` integers where the value at index `abs(x)` is incremented by the value of `a` at index `n-1`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `x` is an integer, and `r` is equal to `k`. The current value of `r` is less than the value of `b` at index `i`, and 'NO' is printed**
