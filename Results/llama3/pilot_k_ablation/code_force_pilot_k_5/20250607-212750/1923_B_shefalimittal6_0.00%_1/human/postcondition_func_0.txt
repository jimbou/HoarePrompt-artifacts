This function reads input from stdin, expecting a specific format: two space-separated integers (n and k) followed by two lists of n space-separated integers. It then processes the input, accumulating values in a list b based on the absolute values of the second list. The function checks if the accumulated value r (initialized to 0 and incremented by k for each iteration) is less than the value in list b at each index i. If r is less than b[i] at any point, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' if the input is valid. If the input format is invalid, it catches the ValueError exception and prints 'Invalid input format'.
