Output State: **`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`, `letter` is the fourth character of `userString`, `countA` and `countB` have their previous values, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In this output state, the values of `userString`, `list(userString)`, `letter`, `countA`, and `countB` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `continue` statement is that it skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop, without changing any variable values.
