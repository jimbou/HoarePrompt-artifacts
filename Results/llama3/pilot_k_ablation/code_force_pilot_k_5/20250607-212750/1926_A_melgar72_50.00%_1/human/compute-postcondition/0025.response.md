The code increments the value of `countB` by 1. The previous values of `userString`, `list(userString)`, `letter`, and `countA` are not affected. Since `letter` is the fourth character of `userString`, which consists of letters A and B, `letter` can be either A or B.

Output State: **`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`, `letter` is either A or B, `countA` has its previous value, and `countB` is increased by 1 from its previous value.**
