Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is 0, countB is 0
Code of the loop:
for letter in userString:
    if letter == 'A':
        countA += 1
    elif letter == 'B':
        countB += 1
    else:
        continue


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: The string `userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B. The `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`. If the first character of `userString` is 'A', then `countA` is 1 and `letter` is 'A'. If the first character of `userString` is 'B', then `countB` is 1 and `letter` is 'B'.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`. If the second character of `userString` is 'A', then `countA` is either 2 or 3, and `countB` is either 1 or 2. If the second character of `userString` is 'B', then `countA` is either 1 or 2, and `countB` is either 2 or 3. In either case, `letter` is either 'A' or 'B' (depending on the second character of `userString`).

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`. `letter` is the third character of `userString`. If the third character of `userString` is 'A', then `countA` is incremented by 1. If the third character of `userString` is 'B', then `countB` is incremented by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`, `letter` is the fourth character of `userString`. If the fourth character of `userString` is 'A', `countA` is increased by 1 from its previous value and `countB` retains its previous value. If the fourth character of `userString` is 'B', `countB` is increased by 1 from its previous value and `countA` retains its previous value.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`userString` is of length 6 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString` and has at least 6 characters, `letter` is the sixth character of `userString`. If the sixth character of `userString` is 'A', `countA` is increased by 2 from its previous value and `countB` retains its previous value. If the sixth character of `userString` is 'B', `countA` is increased by 1 from its previous value and `countB` is increased by 1 from its previous value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
