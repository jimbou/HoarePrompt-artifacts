Output State: **`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`. `letter` is the third character of `userString` and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. The values of `userString`, `list(userString)`, and `letter` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `continue` statement is that it skips to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code inside the loop for the current iteration.
