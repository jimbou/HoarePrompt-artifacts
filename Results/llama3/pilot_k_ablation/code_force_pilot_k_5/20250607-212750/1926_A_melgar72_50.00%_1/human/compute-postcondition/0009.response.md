Postcondition: **The string `userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B. The `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`. If the first character of `userString` is 'B', then `countB` is 1 and `letter` is 'B'. If the first character of `userString` is 'A', then `countA` is 0, `countB` is 0, and `letter` is 'A', and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
