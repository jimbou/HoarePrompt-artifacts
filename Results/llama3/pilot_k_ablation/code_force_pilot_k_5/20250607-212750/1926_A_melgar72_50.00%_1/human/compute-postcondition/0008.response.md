The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration of the loop. Since the initial state does not mention any loop, we assume that this code is inside a loop.

The values of the variables `userString`, `list(userString)`, `countA`, `countB`, and `letter` are not affected by the `continue` statement.

Output State: **`userString` is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`, `countA` is 0, `countB` is 0, `letter` is 'A', and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
