Postcondition: ***`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`. If the second character of `userString` is 'A', then `countA` is either 2 or 3, and `countB` is either 1 or 2. If the second character of `userString` is 'B', then `countA` is either 1 or 2, and `countB` is either 2 or 3. In either case, `letter` is either 'A' or 'B' (depending on the second character of `userString`).***
