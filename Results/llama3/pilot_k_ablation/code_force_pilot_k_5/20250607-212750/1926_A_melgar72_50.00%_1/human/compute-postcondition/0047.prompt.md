You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
        
    #State: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString
    if (countA > countB) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        if (countB > countA) :
            print('B')
            #This is printed: B
        else :
            pass
        #State: *userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString, and countA is less than or equal to countB. If countB is greater than countA, 'B' is printed. If countA is equal to countB, no action is taken.
    #State: *userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString. If countA is greater than countB, 'A' is printed. If countA is less than countB, 'B' is printed. If countA is equal to countB, no action is taken.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString. The current value of countA is higher than the current value of countB, and 'A' is being printed

Case_2: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString, countA is less than or equal to countB, and the current value of countB is greater than countA, and 'B' is printed


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
