Output State: **`userString` is of length 6 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString` and has at least 6 characters, `letter` is the sixth character of `userString`. If the sixth character of `userString` is 'A', `countA` is increased by 1 from its previous value and `countB` retains its previous value. If the sixth character of `userString` is 'B', `countB` is increased by 1 from its previous value and `countA` retains its previous value. We skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we skip to the next iteration of the loop due to the `continue` statement. The values of `userString`, `list(userString)`, `letter`, `countA`, and `countB` remain unchanged.
