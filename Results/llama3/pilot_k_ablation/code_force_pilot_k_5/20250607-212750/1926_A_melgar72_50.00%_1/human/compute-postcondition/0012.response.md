Output State: **`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`, `countA` is either 2 or 3, `countB` is either 1 or 2, and `letter` is either 'A' or 'B' (depending on the second character of `userString`).**

In this output state, the value of `countA` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
