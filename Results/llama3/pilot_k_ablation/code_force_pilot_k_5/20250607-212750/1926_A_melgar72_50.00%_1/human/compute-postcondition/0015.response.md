Postcondition: ***`userString` is of length 5 and consists of letters A and B, `list(userString)` is a list of characters from `userString`, `countA` is either 1 or 2, and `countB` is either 1, 2, or 3 depending on the value of `letter`. If `letter` is 'B', then `countB` is either 2 or 3; otherwise, `countB` remains either 1 or 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.***
