Correctness: **False** 

The program is not correct because it does not handle the first input which is the number of test cases. The program should skip the first input and only process the strings that follow. However, the current program tries to process the first input as a string, which will cause an error because it does not contain any 'A's or 'B's. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings[1:]:
    func_1(userString)

def func_1(userString):
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
    if countA > countB:
        print('A')
    elif countB > countA:
        print('B')
    else:
        pass
```

In this corrected version, the `for` loop starts from the second element of `userStrings` (index 1) using `userStrings[1:]`. This way, the program skips the first input and only processes the strings that follow.
