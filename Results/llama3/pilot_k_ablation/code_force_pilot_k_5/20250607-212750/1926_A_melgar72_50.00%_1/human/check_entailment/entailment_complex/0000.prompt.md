Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Vladislav has a string of length 5 , whose characters are each either
\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} .

Which letter appears most frequently: \texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ?

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 \leq t \leq 32 ) â€” the
number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a string of length 5 consisting of
letters \texttt{A} and \texttt{B} .

All t strings in a test are different (distinct).

Output

For each test case, output one letter (\texttt{A} or \texttt{B} ) denoting the
character that appears most frequently in the string.

Example

Input

    8
    
    ABABB
    
    ABABA
    
    BBBAB
    
    AAAAA
    
    BBBBB
    
    BABAA
    
    AAAAB
    
    BAAAA

Output

    B
    A
    B
    A
    B
    A
    A
    A

# Annotated Program:
userStrings = ['8', 'ABABB', 'ABABA', 'BBBAB', 'AAAAA', 'BBBBB', 'BABAA', 'AAAAB', 'BAAAA']
for userString in userStrings:
    func_1(userString)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B.
    list(userString)
    countA = 0
    countB = 0
    for letter in userString:
        if letter == 'A':
            countA += 1
        elif letter == 'B':
            countB += 1
        else:
            continue
        
    #State: userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString
    if (countA > countB) :
        print('A')
        #This is printed: A
    else :
        if (countB > countA) :
            print('B')
            #This is printed: B
        else :
            pass
        #State: *userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString, and countA is less than or equal to countB. If countB is greater than countA, 'B' is printed. If countA is equal to countB, no action is taken.
    #State: *userString is a string of length 5 consisting of letters A and B, list(userString) is a list of characters from userString, countA is equal to the number of 'A's in userString, countB is equal to the number of 'B's in userString. If countA is greater than countB, 'A' is printed. If countA is less than countB, 'B' is printed. If countA is equal to countB, no action is taken.

#Overall this is what the function does:Counts the occurrences of 'A' and 'B' in a string of length 5, then prints 'A' if 'A' occurs more frequently, prints 'B' if 'B' occurs more frequently, and takes no action if 'A' and 'B' occur equally frequently.
