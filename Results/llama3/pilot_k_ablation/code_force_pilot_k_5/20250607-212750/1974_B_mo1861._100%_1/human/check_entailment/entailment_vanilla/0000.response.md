Reasoning:

1. The problem description clearly explains the encoding process, which involves replacing each character in the original string with its symmetric character from the auxiliary string `r`. The decoding process should reverse this operation.

2. The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes the encoded string as input and returns the decoded string.

3. Inside `func_1`, the program first extracts the unique characters from the encoded string using `set(encoded)` and sorts them in alphabetical order using `sorted`. This correctly constructs the auxiliary string `r`.

4. The program then creates a character mapping `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. This is done using a dictionary comprehension, where each character is mapped to the character at the corresponding position from the end of `r`.

5. Finally, the program uses a generator expression to iterate over the encoded string and replace each character with its corresponding decoded character using the `char_map`. The resulting decoded string is then returned.

6. The main part of the program reads the input data, calls `func_1` for each test case, and prints the results.

Based on this step-by-step analysis, the provided Python program correctly implements the decoding process as described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
