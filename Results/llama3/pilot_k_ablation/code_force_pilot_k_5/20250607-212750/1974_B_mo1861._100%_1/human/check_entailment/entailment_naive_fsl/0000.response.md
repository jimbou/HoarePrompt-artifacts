Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. It first constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string `b`. Then, it creates a character mapping `char_map` that maps each character in `r` to its symmetric character. Finally, it uses this mapping to decode the encoded string `b` and returns the original string `s`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* It correctly handles strings with duplicate characters, as the `set` data structure is used to remove duplicates when constructing the auxiliary string `r`.
* It correctly handles strings with characters that are not in alphabetical order, as the `sorted` function is used to sort the unique characters in `r`.
* It correctly handles strings with characters that are not lowercase Latin letters, as the problem statement guarantees that the input strings only contain lowercase Latin letters.

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* An empty input string, which would result in an empty output string.
* A single-character input string, which would result in the same character as the output string.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
