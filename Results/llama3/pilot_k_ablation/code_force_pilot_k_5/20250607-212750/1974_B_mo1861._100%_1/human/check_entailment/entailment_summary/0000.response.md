Reasoning: 
The provided program is correct. It correctly implements the decoding algorithm described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an encoded string as input, constructs the auxiliary string `r` by sorting the unique characters in the encoded string, creates a character mapping by pairing each character in `r` with its symmetric character, and then uses this mapping to decode the input string.

Correctness: **True**
