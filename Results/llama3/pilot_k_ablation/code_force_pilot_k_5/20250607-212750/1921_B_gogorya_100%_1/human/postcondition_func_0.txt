This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of three lines: an integer n, and two strings s1 and s2 of length n containing only '1's and '0's. For each test case, it calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and the Hamming distance between s1 and s2. It then prints the sum of the absolute difference and half of the absolute difference between the Hamming distance and the absolute difference. After processing all test cases, the function leaves the input stream empty.
