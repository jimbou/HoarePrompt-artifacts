Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `hd` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables from the initial state are still valid, and their values remain unchanged except for `hd`, which has been incremented by 1.
