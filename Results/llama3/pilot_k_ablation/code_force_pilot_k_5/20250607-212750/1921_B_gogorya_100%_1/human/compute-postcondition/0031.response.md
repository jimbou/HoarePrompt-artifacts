Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 1, if the character at index 1 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 1 in `s2`, then `hd` is 1 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`, otherwise `hd` remains the same as the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`, and `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`***
