To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head variables, which are `i` and `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `i` is now 1, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `hd` is 1 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]` otherwise `hd` remains 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 1**
