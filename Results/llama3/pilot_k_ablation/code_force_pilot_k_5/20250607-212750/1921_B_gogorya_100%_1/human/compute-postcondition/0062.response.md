Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is either 3, 4 or 5 depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `hd` is either 2, 3 or 4 depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`.**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` can take values 3, 4, or 5, and if `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` can take values 2, 3, or 4. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
