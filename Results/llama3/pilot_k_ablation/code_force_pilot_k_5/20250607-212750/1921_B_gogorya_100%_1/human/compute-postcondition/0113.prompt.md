Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second and third lines contain strings s and f of n characters, where each character is either '1' or '0'.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    s1 = input()
    s2 = input()
    hd = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s1[i] != s2[i]:
            hd += 1
    res = abs(s1.count('1') - s2.count('1'))
    print(res + abs(hd - res) // 2)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and the result of the expression `res + abs(hd - res) // 2` is being printed, which is the sum of `res` and half of the absolute difference between `hd` and `res`.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is at least 2, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, hd is the Hamming distance between s1 and s2, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and this is printed: the sum of the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2 and the integer division of the absolute difference between the Hamming distance between s1 and s2 and the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2 by 2

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is `n`, and this is printed: the sum of `res` and the integer division of the absolute difference between `hd` and `res` by 2

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, and the value of `res` plus the absolute difference between the Hamming distance `hd` and `res` divided by 2 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `i` is `n`, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, and the value of `res` plus the absolute difference between `hd` and `res` divided by 2 is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
