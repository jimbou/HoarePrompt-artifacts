Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` as in the initial state. However, the value of `hd` will be the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, which is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in `s1` and `s2` are different.
