The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 3, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 3, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. If the character at index 2 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 2 in `s2`, then `hd` is 1 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2` plus 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains the same as the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`.**
