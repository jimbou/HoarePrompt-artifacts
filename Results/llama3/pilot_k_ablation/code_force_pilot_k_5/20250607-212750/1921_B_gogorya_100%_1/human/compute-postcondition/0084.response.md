Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `hd` is 3.**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been incremented by 1. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` was either 2 or 3, and now it is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `hd` was 2 and now it is 3. The values of the other variables remain the same.
