Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `hd` is either 2, 3 or 4 depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been incremented by 1, so it can now be either 2, 3, or 4, depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
