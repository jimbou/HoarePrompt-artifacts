To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t`, `s1`, `s2`, and `hd` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is at least 4, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 3**
