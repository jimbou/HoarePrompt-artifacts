The code prints the sum of `res` and the integer division of the absolute difference between `hd` and `res` by 2.
Where `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`.
Output: **res + abs(hd - res) // 2 (where res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, and hd is the Hamming distance between s1 and s2)**
