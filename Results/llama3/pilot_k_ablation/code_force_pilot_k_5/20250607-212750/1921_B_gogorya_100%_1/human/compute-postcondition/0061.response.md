The only variable in the loop head is `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is either 2, 3 or 4 depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `hd` is either 1, 2 or 3 depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`.**
