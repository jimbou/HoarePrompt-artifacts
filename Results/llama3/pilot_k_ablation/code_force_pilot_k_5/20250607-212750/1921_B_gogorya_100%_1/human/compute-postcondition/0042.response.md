Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, hd is the Hamming distance between s1 and s2, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `hd` will hold the Hamming distance between the strings `s1` and `s2`, which is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different. The variable `res` will still hold the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. The values of `t`, `n`, `s1`, and `s2` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop.
