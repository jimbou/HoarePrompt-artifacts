Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3, `hd` is increased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, except for `hd`, which has been incremented by 1. The value of `hd` is now 1 more than its initial value, but its exact value is still unknown.
