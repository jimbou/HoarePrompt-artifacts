Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of three lines. The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5). The second and third lines contain strings s and f of n characters, where each character is either '1' or '0'.**

In this output state, the variable `t` is assigned the value of the first input, which is a positive integer. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, each consisting of three lines. The first line of each test case contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), and the second and third lines contain strings `s` and `f` of `n` characters, where each character is either '1' or '0'.
