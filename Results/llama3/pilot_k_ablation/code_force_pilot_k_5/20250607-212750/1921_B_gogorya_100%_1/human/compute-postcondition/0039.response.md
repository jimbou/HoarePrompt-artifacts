The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 4, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 4, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `hd` is the same as the previous iteration**
