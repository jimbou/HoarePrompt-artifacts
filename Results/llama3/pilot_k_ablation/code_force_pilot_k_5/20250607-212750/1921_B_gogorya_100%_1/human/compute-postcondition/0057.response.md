Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is either 2 or 3 depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`. Otherwise, `hd` is either 1 or 2 depending on whether `s1[i]` is equal to `s2[i]`.***
