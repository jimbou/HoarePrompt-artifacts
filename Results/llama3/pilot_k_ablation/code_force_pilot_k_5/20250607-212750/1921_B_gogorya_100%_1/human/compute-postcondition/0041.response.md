Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 4, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `i` is 4, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. If the character at index `i` in `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, then `hd` is the same as the previous iteration plus 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains the same as the previous iteration.***
