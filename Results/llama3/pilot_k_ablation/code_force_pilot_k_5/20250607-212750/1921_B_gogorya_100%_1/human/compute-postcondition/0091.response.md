The only variable in the loop head is `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `_` must be increased by 1 so `_` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`**
