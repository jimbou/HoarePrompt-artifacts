The value of `hd` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `hd` was 0, so the new value of `hd` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is 1, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s1` at index `i` is not equal to the current value of `s2` at index `i`.**
