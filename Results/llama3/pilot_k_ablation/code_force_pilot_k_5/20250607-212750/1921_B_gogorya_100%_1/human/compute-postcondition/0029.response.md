According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 1, `hd` is 1 if the character at index 0 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 0 in `s2`, otherwise `hd` is 0, and `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`**
