To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `n` to be greater than 0 and set `i` to 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **t is at least 2, n is greater than 0, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, hd is 0, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, i is 0**
