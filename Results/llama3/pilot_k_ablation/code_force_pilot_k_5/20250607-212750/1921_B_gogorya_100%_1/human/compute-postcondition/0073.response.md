Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 0. If the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are different, `hd` is 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains 0.***
