Output: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, and the result of the expression `res + abs(hd - res) // 2` is being printed, which is the sum of `res` and half of the absolute difference between `hd` and `res`.**
