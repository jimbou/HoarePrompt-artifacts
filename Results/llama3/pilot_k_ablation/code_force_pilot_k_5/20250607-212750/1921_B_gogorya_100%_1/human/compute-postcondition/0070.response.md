To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is initialized to `n` before the loop starts, we need to adjust `i` to be 0 (the starting value of the range) and `n` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is 0, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 0**
