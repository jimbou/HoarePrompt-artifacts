Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, `hd` is either 1 or 2 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, otherwise `hd` is 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: `t` is still at least 2, `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `s1` and `s2` are still strings, `res` is still the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is still 2, `stdin` is still empty, `i` is still 2, and `hd` is either 1 or 2 if `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, otherwise `hd` is 1.
