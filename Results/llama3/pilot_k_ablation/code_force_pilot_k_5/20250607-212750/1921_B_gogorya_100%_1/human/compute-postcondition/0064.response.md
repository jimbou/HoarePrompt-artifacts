Output State: **t is at least 2, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s1 and s2 are strings, hd is the Hamming distance between s1 and s2, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, _ is 1, stdin is empty, and i is n.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `hd` will be the Hamming distance between the strings `s1` and `s2`, which is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different. The other variables remain unchanged.
