Output: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, and the value of `res` plus the absolute difference between the Hamming distance `hd` and `res` divided by 2 is being printed**
