Postcondition: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`. The current value of `i` is 1, and at this index, the characters in `s1` and `s2` are not equal, i.e., `s1[1] != s2[1]`.**
