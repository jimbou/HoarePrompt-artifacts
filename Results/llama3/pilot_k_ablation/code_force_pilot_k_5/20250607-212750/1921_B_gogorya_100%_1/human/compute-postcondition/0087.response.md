Output State: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is `n`, and `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`.*

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same values for all variables except `i` and `hd`. The value of `i` will be equal to `n`, and the value of `hd` will be the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, which is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters in `s1` and `s2` are different.
