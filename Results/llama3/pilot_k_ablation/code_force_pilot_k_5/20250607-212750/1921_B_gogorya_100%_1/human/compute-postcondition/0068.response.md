To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. If `t` is greater than the current value of `_`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 1, and `t` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, and `t` must remain the same.

State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is `n`**
