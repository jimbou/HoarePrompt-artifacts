Output State: **`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4, `hd` is increased by 1 if the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been updated to be increased by 1 if the character at index `i-1` in `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i-1` in `s2`. All other variables remain unchanged.
