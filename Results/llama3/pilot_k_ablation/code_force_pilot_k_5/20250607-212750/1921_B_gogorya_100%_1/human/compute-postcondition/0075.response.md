Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `hd` is either 1 or 2**

The value of `hd` is incremented by 1. Since `hd` was either 0 or 1 initially, it is now either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
