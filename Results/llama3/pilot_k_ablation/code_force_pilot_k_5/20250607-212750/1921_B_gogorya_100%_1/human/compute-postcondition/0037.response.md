Output State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 3, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 3, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. If the character at index 2 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 2 in `s2`, then `hd` is 2 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`. Otherwise, `hd` is 1 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`.**

In this output state, the value of `hd` has been incremented by 1. If the character at index 2 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 2 in `s2`, then `hd` is now 2 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`. Otherwise, `hd` is now 1 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
