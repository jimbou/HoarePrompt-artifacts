Postcondition: ***`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 2, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4. If `s1[i]` is not equal to `s2[i]`, then `hd` is either 3 or 4. Otherwise, `hd` is 3.***
