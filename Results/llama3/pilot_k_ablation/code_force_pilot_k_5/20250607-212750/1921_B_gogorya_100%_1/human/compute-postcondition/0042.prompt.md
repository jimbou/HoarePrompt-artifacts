Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 2, n is an integer, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, hd is 0, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        hd += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is at least 2, n is greater than 0, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, i is 0, and res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2. If the character at index i in s1 is not equal to the character at index i in s2, then hd is 1. Otherwise, hd remains 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 1, if the character at index 1 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 1 in `s2`, then `hd` is 1 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`, otherwise `hd` remains the same as the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`, and `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 2, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. If the character at index 2 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 2 in `s2`, then `hd` is 1 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2` plus 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains the same as the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 3, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `i` is 3, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. If the character at index 3 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 3 in `s2`, then `hd` is 2 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`. If the character at index 3 in `s1` is equal to the character at index 3 in `s2`, and the character at index 2 in `s1` is not equal to the character at index 2 in `s2`, then `hd` is 1 plus the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`. Otherwise, `hd` remains the same as the initial difference between the first characters of `s1` and `s2`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 4, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `i` is 4, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`. If the character at index `i` in `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, then `hd` is the same as the previous iteration plus 1. Otherwise, `hd` remains the same as the previous iteration.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
