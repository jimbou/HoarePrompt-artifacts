Output State: **t is 0, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, _ is t, i is n, hd is the Hamming distance between s1 and s2, and stdin is empty.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable t has been decremented to 0, the variables n, s1, and s2 retain their last values from the input, the variable res holds the absolute difference between the number of '1's in the last s1 and s2, the variable _ holds the final value of t, the variable i holds the last value of n, the variable hd holds the Hamming distance between the last s1 and s2, and the standard input (stdin) is empty because all test cases have been processed.
