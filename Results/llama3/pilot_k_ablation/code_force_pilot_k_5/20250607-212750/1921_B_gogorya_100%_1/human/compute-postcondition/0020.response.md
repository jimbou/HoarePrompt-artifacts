The code calculates the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2` and assigns it to `res`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`.**
