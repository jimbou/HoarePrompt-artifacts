Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is at least 3, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, s1 is a string, s2 is a string, res is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in s1 and s2, _ is 3, stdin is empty, i is n, and hd is the Hamming distance between s1 and s2
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if s1[i] != s2[i]:
        hd += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1. If the characters at index `i` in `s1` and `s2` are different, the Hamming distance `hd` between `s1` and `s2` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the Hamming distance remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, then `hd` is increased by 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 3. If the character at index `i` in `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, then `hd` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4. If the character at index `i` in `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i` in `s2`, `hd` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `hd`.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is at least 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 3, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 5. If the character at index `i` of `s1` is not equal to the character at index `i` of `s2`, then `hd` is increased by 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
