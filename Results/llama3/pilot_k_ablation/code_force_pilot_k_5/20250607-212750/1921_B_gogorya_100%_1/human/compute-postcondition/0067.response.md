Output: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `s1` and `s2` are strings, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is `n`, and this is printed: the sum of `res` and the integer division of the absolute difference between `hd` and `res` by 2**
