The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 2, so for the loop to execute again `_` must be 1 and `t` is at least 2.
State: **`t` is at least 2, `n` is an integer, `s1` is a string, `s2` is a string, `hd` is the Hamming distance between `s1` and `s2`, `res` is the absolute difference between the number of '1's in `s1` and `s2`, `_` is 1**
