Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of distributing water evenly among n containers. The program works by iterating through each container and calculating the difference between the current amount of water and the target amount. If at any point the cumulative difference becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water to distribute evenly, and the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program's logic is correct because it takes into account the constraint that water can only be poured from a container with a lower index to a container with a higher index. By iterating through the containers in order and checking the cumulative difference, the program effectively simulates the process of pouring water from one container to another.

The program also correctly handles the case where the sum of the water amounts is divisible by n, which is a necessary condition for distributing the water evenly.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and execution summary, the given Python program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
