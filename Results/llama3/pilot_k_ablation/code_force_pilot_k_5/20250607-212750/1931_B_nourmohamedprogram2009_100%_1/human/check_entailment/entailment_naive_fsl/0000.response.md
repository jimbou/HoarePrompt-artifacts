Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operation. The key insight is that the sum of the water in all containers is divisible by the number of containers, so the target amount of water in each container is an integer.

The program calculates the target amount of water in each container and then iterates through the containers, keeping track of the current balance of water. If at any point the current balance becomes negative, it means that there is not enough water in the previous containers to fill the current container to the target amount, so the program sets `possible` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

If the program finishes iterating through all the containers without setting `possible` to `False`, it means that it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, so it prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the edge cases where the number of containers is 1 or where the amount of water in each container is already equal to the target amount. Therefore, the program is correct.
