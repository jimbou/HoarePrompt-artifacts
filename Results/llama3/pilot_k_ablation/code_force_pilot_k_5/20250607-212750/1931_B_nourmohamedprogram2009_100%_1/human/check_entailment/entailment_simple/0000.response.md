Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads the input and initializes the variables.
2. It calculates the total amount of water and the target amount of water per container.
3. It iterates through the containers and checks if it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another.
4. The condition `current_balance < 0` checks if there is a container that has more water than the target amount, and if so, it sets `possible` to `False`.
5. If `possible` is still `True` after the loop, it means that it's possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The program correctly implements the logic of the problem and handles all possible cases.

Correctness: **True**
