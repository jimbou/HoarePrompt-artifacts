Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n+1, t is greater than n+1+1, _ is equal to n+1+1, current_balance is either increased by a[i] - target or decreased by target - a[i], and possible is False.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the program's state.

Therefore, the only change to the initial state is that `possible` is now `False`. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
