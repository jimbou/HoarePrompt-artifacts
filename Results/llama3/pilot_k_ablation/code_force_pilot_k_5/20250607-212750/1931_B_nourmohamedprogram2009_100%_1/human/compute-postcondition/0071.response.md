Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is 1, `current_balance` is `a[1] - target`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a[0]` is less than the `target`, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to `a[1] - target`, which is the difference between the second element of the list `a` and the target value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of `possible` is still dependent on the value of `a[0]` relative to the `target`.
