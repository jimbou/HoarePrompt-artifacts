Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is updated to `current_balance + a[4] + a[i] - 2*target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the value of `possible` is not updated.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 4, `i` is still 4, and `a` is still a list of integers. The total water is still the sum of all elements in `a`, and the target is still the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The current balance has been updated by adding the value of `a[4]` and `a[i]` and subtracting twice the target. If the current balance is negative, then it is not possible, otherwise, the possibility is not updated.
