Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is equal to n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty. If current_balance is not less than 0, then possible is True and 'YES' is being printed. If current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False and 'NO' is printed.***
