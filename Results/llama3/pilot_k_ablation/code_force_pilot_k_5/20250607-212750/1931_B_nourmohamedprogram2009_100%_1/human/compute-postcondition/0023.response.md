Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `current_balance` is increased by `a[4] - target` and `possible` is False. Otherwise, `current_balance` is increased by `a[4] - target` and the state of the program remains unchanged, except that if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] - 4*target` is less than 0, then `possible` is False.**
