Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n+1, t is greater than n+1+1, _ is equal to n+1+1, current_balance is either increased by a[i] - target or decreased by target - a[i], possible is False.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged because the code snippet does not modify them. The value of `possible` is set to `False` by the first line of the code. The value of `current_balance` is not directly modified by the code snippet, but its previous state is either increased by `a[i] - target` or decreased by `target - a[i]`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.
