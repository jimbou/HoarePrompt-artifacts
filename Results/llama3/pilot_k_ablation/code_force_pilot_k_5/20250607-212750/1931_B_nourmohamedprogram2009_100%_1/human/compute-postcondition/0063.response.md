The only variable in the loop head is variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `_` is increased by 1 and `t` is still an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is equal to `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times the `target`, `possible` is True if `current_balance` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is equal to `n` plus 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive**
