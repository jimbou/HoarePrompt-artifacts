Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is 4, `current_balance` is increased by `a[4] - target`, if `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 inputs.***
