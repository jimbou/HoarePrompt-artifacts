Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is equal to n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty. If current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains True.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop has finished executing, and the value of `i` is now equal to `n`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged, except for `current_balance` and `possible`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False, indicating that the loop was unable to balance the water. Otherwise, `possible` remains True, indicating that the loop was able to balance the water.
