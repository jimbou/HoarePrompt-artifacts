Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True, `_` is 0, `stdin` contains t-2 test cases**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to `a[0] - target`, which is the difference between the first element of the list `a` and the value of `target`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-2 test cases.
