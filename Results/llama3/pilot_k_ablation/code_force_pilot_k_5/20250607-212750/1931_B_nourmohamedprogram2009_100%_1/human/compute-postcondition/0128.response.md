Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[i] - target`, `possible` is True, `i` is less than `n`, `t` is greater than `n+1`, `_` is equal to `n+1`, `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to `a[i] - target`, where `a[i]` is the element at index `i` in the list `a` and `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.
