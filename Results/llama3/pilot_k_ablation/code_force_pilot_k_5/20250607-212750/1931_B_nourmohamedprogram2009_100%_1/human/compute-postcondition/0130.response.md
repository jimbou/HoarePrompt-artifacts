The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`, which was previously `True`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the execution of the code block. However, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement does not have any effect on the variables or the execution flow.

Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is a[i] - target, possible is False, i is less than n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty. The current value of current_balance is less than 0.**
