To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target`, `possible` is True if `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target` is not less than 0, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.**
