Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_water = sum(a)
    target = total_water // n
    current_balance = 0
    possible = True
    for i in range(n):
        current_balance += a[i] - target
        if current_balance < 0:
            possible = False
            break
    if possible:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, and `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is the sum of all elements in a minus n times the target, possible is True if current_balance is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise possible is False. If possible is True, 'YES' is printed. If possible is False, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` in range `n`. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`i` is equal to `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, `possible` is True and 'YES' is printed. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False and 'NO' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is equal to n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty. If current_balance is not less than 0, then possible is True and 'YES' is being printed. If current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False and 'NO' is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
