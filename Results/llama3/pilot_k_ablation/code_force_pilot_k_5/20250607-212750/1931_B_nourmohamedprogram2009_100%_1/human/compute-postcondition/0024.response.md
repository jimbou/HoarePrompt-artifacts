Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `possible` is True if `current_balance` is not less than 0, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

- The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive.
- The value of `n` remains unchanged, still an integer greater than or equal to 0.
- The value of `i` is now equal to `n`, indicating that the loop has executed `n` times.
- The value of `a` remains unchanged, still a list of integers.
- The value of `total_water` remains unchanged, still an integer.
- The value of `target` remains unchanged, still an integer.
- The value of `current_balance` is now the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, indicating that the loop has added the difference between each element in `a` and `target` to `current_balance` for `n` iterations.
- The value of `possible` is True if `current_balance` is not less than 0, otherwise it is False, indicating whether the loop was able to maintain a non-negative balance throughout its execution.
- The value of `_` remains unchanged, still 0.
- The value of stdin remains unchanged, still containing t-2 test cases.
