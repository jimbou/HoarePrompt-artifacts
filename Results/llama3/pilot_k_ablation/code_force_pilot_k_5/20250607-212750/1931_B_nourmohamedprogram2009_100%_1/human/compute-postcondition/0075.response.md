Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is 2, `current_balance` is increased by `a[2] - target`, `stdin` contains 0 inputs. If `a[0]` is less than the `target`, then `possible` is False. If the new value of `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_balance` is increased by the difference between the third element of list `a` and the target value, which is the total water divided by the number of elements `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `possible` is updated based on the new value of `current_balance` and the first element of list `a`.
