The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, so for the loop to execute again `_` must be equal to `n+1` and `t` must be greater than `n+1`. The other variables are not in the loop head, so they cannot be adjusted.
State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, `_` is equal to `n+1`, `t` is greater than `n+1`**
