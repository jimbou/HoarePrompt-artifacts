Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` in range `n`. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
