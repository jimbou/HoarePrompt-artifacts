Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is less than `n+1`, `t` is greater than `n+1+1`, `_` is equal to `n+1+1`, `current_balance` is either increased by `a[i] - target` or decreased by `target - a[i]`, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated by adding the difference between the `i-th` element of list `a` and the `target` value. If this difference is positive, `current_balance` increases; otherwise, it decreases. The state of `possible` is updated accordingly, becoming False if `current_balance` becomes negative. All other variables remain unchanged.
