To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0]` + `a[1]` - 2*`target`, if `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False, otherwise `possible` remains True, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**
