Output State: **`i` is equal to `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, and `possible` is False if `current_balance` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` remains True.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `i` will be equal to the number of iterations `n`. The variable `current_balance` will be the total sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `n` times the target value. If at any point during the loop's execution the `current_balance` becomes less than 0, the variable `possible` will be set to False, indicating that the target cannot be achieved. Otherwise, `possible` will remain True, indicating that the target can be achieved.
