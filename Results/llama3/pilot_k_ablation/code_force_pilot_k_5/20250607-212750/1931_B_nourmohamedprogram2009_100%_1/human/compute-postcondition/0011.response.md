Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target`, `possible` is True if `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target` is not less than 0, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.***
