Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is 0, possible is True, i is equal to n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    current_balance += a[i] - target
    if current_balance < 0:
        possible = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty. If the current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is less than `n+1`, `t` is greater than `n+1+1`, `_` is equal to `n+1+1`, `current_balance` is either increased by `a[i] - target` or decreased by `target - a[i]`, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n+2, t is greater than n+1+1, _ is equal to n+1+1, current_balance is either increased by a[i] - target or decreased by target - a[i]. If current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n+1, t is greater than n+1+1, _ is equal to n+1+1, current_balance is either increased by a[i] - target or decreased by target - a[i]. If current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is less than `n+2`, `t` is greater than `n+2+1`, `_` is equal to `n+2+1`, `current_balance` is either increased by `a[i]` - `target` or decreased by `target` - `a[i]`, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
