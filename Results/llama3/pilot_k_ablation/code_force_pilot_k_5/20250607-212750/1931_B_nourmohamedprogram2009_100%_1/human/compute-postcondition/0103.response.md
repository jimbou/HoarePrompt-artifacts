The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`, overwriting its previous value. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or switch statement it is enclosed in. However, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the initial state or the code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect on the variables or the state.

Output State: **n is greater than 1, i is 1, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is a[1] + a[i] - 2*target, possible is False, stdin contains 0 inputs.**
