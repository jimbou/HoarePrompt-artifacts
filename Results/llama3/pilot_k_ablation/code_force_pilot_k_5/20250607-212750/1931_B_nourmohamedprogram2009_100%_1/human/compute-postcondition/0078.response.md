The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **n is an integer greater than 3, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is 3, stdin contains 0 inputs. If a[0] is less than the target, then possible is False. If current_balance is increased by a[2] - target and the new value of current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, current_balance is increased by a[2] - target and possible remains unchanged.**
