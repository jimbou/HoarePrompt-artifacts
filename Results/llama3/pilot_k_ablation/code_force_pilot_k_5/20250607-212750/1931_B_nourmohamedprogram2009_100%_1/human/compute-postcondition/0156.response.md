Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is equal to n, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is the sum of all elements in a minus n times the target, possible is True if current_balance is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise possible is False, and _ is equal to t. stdin is empty.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed all the iterations, and the variables in the loop head and body have reached their final values. The value of `t` is now between 0 and 10^4 inclusive, indicating that all test cases have been processed. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 0, but it is now equal to the number of elements in the last test case. The value of `i` is equal to `n`, indicating that the inner loop has finished executing. The value of `a` is still a list of integers, but it now contains the elements of the last test case. The value of `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, and the value of `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The value of `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times the target, and the value of `possible` is True if `current_balance` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise it is False. The value of `_` is equal to `t`, indicating that the loop has executed all the iterations. Finally, stdin is empty, indicating that all input has been processed.
