Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is n, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is 0, possible is True, and _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    current_balance += a[i] - target
    if current_balance < 0:
        possible = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is False if `current_balance` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` remains True, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than 1, i is 1, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is a[0] + a[1] - 2*target, if current_balance is less than 0, possible is False, otherwise possible remains True, _ is 1, and stdin contains t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target, if current_balance is less than 0, possible is False, otherwise possible remains True, _ is 1, and stdin contains t-4 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] - 5*target`, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] + a[5] - 6*target`, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
