Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is 4, `current_balance` is increased by `a[4] - target`, `possible` is False if `current_balance` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 4, the list `a` remains unchanged, the total water is still the sum of all elements in `a`, the target value is still the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, the index `i` is still 4, the current balance has been increased by the difference between the 5th element of `a` and the target value, and the possibility is set to False if the current balance is negative, otherwise it remains the same. There are no more inputs in stdin.
