Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[1] + a[i] - 2*target`, `possible` is True if `a[1] + a[i] - 2*target` is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise `possible` is False, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 1, `i` remains 1, `a` is still a list of integers, `total_water` is still the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is still the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The value of `current_balance` is updated to `a[1] + a[i] - 2*target`, which means it is increased by `a[i] - target`. The value of `possible` is updated based on the new value of `current_balance`. If `a[1] + a[i] - 2*target` is greater than or equal to 0, then `possible` is True, otherwise `possible` is False. The stdin still contains 0 inputs.
