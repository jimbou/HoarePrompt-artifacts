Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is n, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is the sum of all elements in a minus n times the target, possible is False if current_balance is less than 0, otherwise possible remains True, _ is 1, and stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `i` will be equal to `n`, the variable `current_balance` will be the sum of all elements in the list `a` minus `n` times the `target`, and the variable `possible` will be `False` if `current_balance` is less than 0, otherwise it will remain `True`. The other variables in the precondition remain unchanged.
