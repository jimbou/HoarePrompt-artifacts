State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] - 4*target`, `possible` is False if `current_balance` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` remains True, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**
