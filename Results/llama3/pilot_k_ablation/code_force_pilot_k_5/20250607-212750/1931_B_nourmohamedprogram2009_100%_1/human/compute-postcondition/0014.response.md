Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers, total_water is an integer, target is an integer, current_balance is a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target, possible is False, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

The code snippet sets the value of `possible` to `False` and then encounters a `break` statement, which terminates the loop. Since `possible` was set to `False`, this value is retained. The `break` statement does not affect any other variables. The rest of the variables remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code.
