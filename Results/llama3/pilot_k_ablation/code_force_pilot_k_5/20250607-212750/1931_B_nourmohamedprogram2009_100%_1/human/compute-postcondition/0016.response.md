The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target`, `possible` is False if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` is True, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
