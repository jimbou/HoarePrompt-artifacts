Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, and `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If `current_balance` is not less than 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
