The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[1] - target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True. stdin contains 0 inputs.**
