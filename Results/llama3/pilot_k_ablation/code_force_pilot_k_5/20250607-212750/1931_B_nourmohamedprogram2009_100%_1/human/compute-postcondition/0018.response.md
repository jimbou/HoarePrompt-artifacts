Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than 3, i is 3, a is a list of integers, total_water is an integer, target is an integer, current_balance is a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] - 4*target, possible is False, _ is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

The code snippet sets the value of `possible` to `False` and then encounters a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables. As a result, the only change to the initial state is that `possible` is now `False`. All other variables remain unchanged.
