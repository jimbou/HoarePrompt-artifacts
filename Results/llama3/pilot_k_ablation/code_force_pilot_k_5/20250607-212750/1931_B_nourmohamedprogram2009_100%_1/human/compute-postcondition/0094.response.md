The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` in range `n`, `t` is greater than 0**
