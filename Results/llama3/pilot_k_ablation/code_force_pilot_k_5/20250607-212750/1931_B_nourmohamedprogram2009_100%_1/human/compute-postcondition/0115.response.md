Output State: **n is greater than 4, i is 4, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is updated to current_balance + a[4] + a[i] - 2*target, possible is False.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains greater than 4, and `i` remains 4. The list `a` remains unchanged, and `total_water` remains the sum of all elements in `a`. The value of `target` remains the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The value of `current_balance` is updated to `current_balance + a[4] + a[i] - 2*target`, which means it is incremented by the sum of the elements at indices 4 and `i` in list `a`, minus twice the value of `target`. The value of `possible` is set to False.
