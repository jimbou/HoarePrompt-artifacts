Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is updated to `current_balance + a[3] - target`, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the value of `possible` is not updated.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 3, `i` remains 3, and `a` is still a list of integers. The total water is still the sum of all elements in `a`, and the target is still the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The `current_balance` has been updated by adding the 4th element of `a` minus the target. If this updated `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False; otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.
