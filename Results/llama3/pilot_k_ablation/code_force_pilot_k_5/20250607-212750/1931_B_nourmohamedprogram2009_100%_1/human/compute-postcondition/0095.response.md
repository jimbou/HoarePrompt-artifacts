Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is not defined, current_balance is 0, possible is True, stdin contains 0 inputs**

In this output state, the value of `n` is updated to be an integer greater than or equal to 0, which is obtained from the input. The list `a` is updated to contain integers obtained from the input. The variable `total_water` is updated to be the sum of all elements in `a`. The variable `target` is updated to be the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The variable `i` is not defined because it is not assigned a value in the given code snippet. The variable `current_balance` is updated to be 0. The variable `possible` is updated to be True. The stdin is empty because all inputs have been read.
