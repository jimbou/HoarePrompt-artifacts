Output State: **n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n+2, t is greater than n+1+1, _ is equal to n+1+1, current_balance is either increased by a[i] - target or decreased by target - a[i], and possible is False.**

The code snippet assigns False to the variable `possible` and then encounters a `break` statement, which terminates the execution of the loop. Since `possible` was assigned False, it remains False after the code execution. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.
