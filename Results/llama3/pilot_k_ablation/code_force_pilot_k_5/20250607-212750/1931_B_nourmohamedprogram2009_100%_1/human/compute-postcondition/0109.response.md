To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the variables in the loop head and how they change based on the loop's condition.

The loop head is `for i in range(n):`, which means the only variables we can adjust are `i` and `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `i` is 2.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3. The loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 3.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `i` is 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

The other variables (`a`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, and `possible`) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is updated to `current_balance + a[2] - target`, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the value of `possible` is not updated.**
