Output State: **n is greater than 3, i is 3, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is updated to current_balance + a[3] - target, and possible is False.**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `n`, `i`, `a`, `total_water`, or `target`. The value of `current_balance` is updated based on the previous value of `current_balance`, `a[3]`, and `target`, but the exact value is not specified. The value of `possible` is set to `False` regardless of its previous value. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables.
