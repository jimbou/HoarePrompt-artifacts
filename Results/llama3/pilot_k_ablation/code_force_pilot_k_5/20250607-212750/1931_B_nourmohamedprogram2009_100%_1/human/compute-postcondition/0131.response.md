Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty. If the current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
