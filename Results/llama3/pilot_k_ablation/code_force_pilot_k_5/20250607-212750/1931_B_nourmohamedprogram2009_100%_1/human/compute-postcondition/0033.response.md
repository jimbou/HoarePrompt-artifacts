Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, i is n, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is 0, possible is True, and _ is 1, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the input. The list `a` now contains the integers from the second input line. The variable `total_water` has been assigned the sum of all elements in `a`. The `target` has been calculated as the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The `current_balance` has been reset to 0. The variable `possible` has been set to True. The value of `i` is still equal to `n`. The value of `_` remains 1. The number of test cases in stdin has been reduced by 2.
