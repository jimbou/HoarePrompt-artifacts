Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is 0, possible is True, i is equal to n, t is greater than n+1, _ is equal to n+1, stdin is empty**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

After executing the code, the value of `n` is updated to an integer input from stdin. The list `a` is populated with a space-separated list of integers from stdin. The variable `total_water` is calculated as the sum of all elements in `a`. The `target` is calculated as the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The `current_balance` is reset to 0, and the `possible` flag is set to True. The values of `i`, `t`, and `_` remain unchanged, with `i` still equal to `n`, `t` still greater than `n+1`, and `_` still equal to `n+1`. The stdin is now empty, as all inputs have been consumed by the code.
