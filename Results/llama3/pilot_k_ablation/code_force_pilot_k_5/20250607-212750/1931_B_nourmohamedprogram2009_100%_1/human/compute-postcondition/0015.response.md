Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target`, `possible` is False if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` is True, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
