Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target`, `possible` is False if `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` remains True, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target` by adding `a[i] - target` to its previous value, where `i` is 1. The value of `possible` is also updated based on the new value of `current_balance`. The other variables remain unchanged.
