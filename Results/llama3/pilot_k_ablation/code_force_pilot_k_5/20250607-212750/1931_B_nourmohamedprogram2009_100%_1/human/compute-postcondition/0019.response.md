Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] - 4*target` is less than 0, then `possible` is False, otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged.**
