Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is 3, `current_balance` is increased by `a[3] - target`, `possible` is unchanged, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated by adding `a[3] - target` to its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `possible` is still unchanged because the condition for changing it is not met. The stdin still contains 0 inputs.
