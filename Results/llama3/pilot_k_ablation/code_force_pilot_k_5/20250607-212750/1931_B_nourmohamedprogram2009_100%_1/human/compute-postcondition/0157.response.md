Functionality: **This function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n integers. It determines whether it is possible to distribute the sum of the integers evenly among n containers, and prints 'YES' if possible and 'NO' otherwise. The function processes all test cases and then terminates, leaving the standard input empty.**
