Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, total_water is an integer, target is an integer, current_balance is 0, possible is True, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `t` remains unchanged, still an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. The variable `n` now holds an integer value read from the input. The list `a` contains a list of integers read from the input. The variable `total_water` holds the sum of all integers in list `a`. The variable `target` is calculated as the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The variable `current_balance` is initialized to 0. The variable `possible` is set to True. The variable `_` remains unchanged, still 0. The stdin now contains `t-2` test cases, as two inputs have been read.
