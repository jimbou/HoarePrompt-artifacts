The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n+1`, `n` is an integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is less than `n+2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i` so `n` is greater than or equal to `i` and greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is less than `n+2`, `t` is greater than `n+1+1`, `_` is equal to `n+1+1`, `current_balance` is either increased by `a[i] - target` or decreased by `target - a[i]`, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.**
