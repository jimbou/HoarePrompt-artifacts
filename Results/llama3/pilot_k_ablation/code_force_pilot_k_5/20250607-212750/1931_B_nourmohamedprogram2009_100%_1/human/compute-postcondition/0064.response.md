Output State: **n is an integer greater than or equal to 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is 0, possible is True, _ is equal to n plus 1, t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, i is equal to n, stdin contains 0 inputs**

The code first assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, it remains an integer greater than or equal to 0. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `a`. Stdin is now empty. The third line calculates the sum of all elements in `a` and assigns it to `total_water`. The fourth line calculates the integer division of `total_water` by `n` and assigns it to `target`. The fifth line assigns 0 to `current_balance`. The sixth line assigns True to `possible`. The seventh line does not affect any variables. The eighth line assigns `n` plus 1 to `_`. The ninth line does not affect any variables. The tenth line does not affect any variables. The eleventh line assigns `n` to `i`. The twelfth line does not affect any variables. The thirteenth line does not affect any variables. The fourteenth line does not affect any variables. The fifteenth line does not affect any variables. The sixteenth line does not affect any variables. The seventeenth line does not affect any variables. The eighteenth line does not affect any variables. The nineteenth line does not affect any variables. The twentieth line does not affect any variables.
