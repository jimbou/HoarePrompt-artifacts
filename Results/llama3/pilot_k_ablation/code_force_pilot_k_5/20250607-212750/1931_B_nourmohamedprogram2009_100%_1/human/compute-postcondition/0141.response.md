Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is less than `n+1`, `t` is greater than `n+1+1`, `_` is equal to `n+1+1`, `current_balance` is either increased by `a[i] - target` or decreased by `target - a[i]`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated based on the previous value of `current_balance` and the values of `a[i]` and `target`. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for `possible` being False or remaining unchanged is also updated based on the new value of `current_balance`.
