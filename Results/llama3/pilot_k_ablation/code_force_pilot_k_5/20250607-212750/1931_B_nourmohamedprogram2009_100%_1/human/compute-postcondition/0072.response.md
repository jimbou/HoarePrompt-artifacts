Output State: **n is an integer greater than 1, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is 1, current_balance is a[1] - target, possible is False, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `possible = False` and `break`. The first line assigns the value `False` to the variable `possible`. The second line, `break`, is a statement that terminates the loop or the closest enclosing loop. However, since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, the `break` statement has no effect.

The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the variable `possible`, which is now set to `False`. The values of `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `i`, and `current_balance` remain the same as in the initial state. The state of `stdin` also remains unchanged, containing 0 inputs.
