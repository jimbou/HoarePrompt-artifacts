Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is equal to `n`, `current_balance` is the sum of `a[i] - target` for all `i` in range `n`, if `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False, otherwise `possible` remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 inputs.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all iterations is that the loop variable `i` will be equal to the initial value of `n`. The `current_balance` will be the sum of the differences between each element in the list `a` and the target value, calculated for all indices in the range of `n`. If at any point during the loop the `current_balance` becomes negative, the `possible` variable will be set to False. Otherwise, the `possible` variable will remain unchanged. The other variables, `n`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, and `stdin`, will retain their initial values, as they are not affected by the loop.
