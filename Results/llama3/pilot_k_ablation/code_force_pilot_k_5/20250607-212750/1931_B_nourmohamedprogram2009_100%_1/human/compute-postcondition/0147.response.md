Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `i` is less than `n+2`, `t` is greater than `n+2+1`, `_` is equal to `n+2+1`, `current_balance` is either increased by `a[i]` - `target` or decreased by `target` - `a[i]`, and if `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.**
