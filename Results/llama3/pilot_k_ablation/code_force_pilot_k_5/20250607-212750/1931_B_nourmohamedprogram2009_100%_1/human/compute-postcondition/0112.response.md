Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is updated to `current_balance + a[3] - target`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, the value of `possible` is not updated.***
