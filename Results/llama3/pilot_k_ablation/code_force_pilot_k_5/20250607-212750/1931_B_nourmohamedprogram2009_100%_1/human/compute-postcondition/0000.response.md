The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to `t`. The stdin contains an integer `t` (1 <= t <= 10^4) first, and that integer is assigned into `t`. So stdin now contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, stdin contains `t-1` test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n` (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (0 <= a_i <= 10^9) such that the sum of `a_i` is divisible by `n`.**
