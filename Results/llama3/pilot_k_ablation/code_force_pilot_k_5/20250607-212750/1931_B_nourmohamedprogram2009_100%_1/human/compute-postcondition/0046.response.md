Postcondition: **t is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target, if current_balance is less than 0, possible is False, otherwise possible remains True, _ is 1, and stdin contains t-4 test cases.**
