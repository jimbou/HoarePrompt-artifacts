Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] - 5*target`, `possible` is False if `current_balance` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` remains True, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases**

The code increments the `current_balance` by the value of `a[i]` (which is `a[3]`) minus the `target`. The value of `i` is 3, so `a[i]` is `a[3]`. The value of `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`. The value of `current_balance` is updated to `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] - 5*target`. The values of the other variables remain the same.
