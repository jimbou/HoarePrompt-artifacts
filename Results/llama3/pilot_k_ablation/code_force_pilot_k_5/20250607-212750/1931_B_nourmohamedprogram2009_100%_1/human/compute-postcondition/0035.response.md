Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True, and `_` is 1, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `current_balance` has been updated to be the difference between the first element of the list `a` and the target value, which is the integer division of the total water by the number of test cases. All other variables remain unchanged. The input stream still contains `t-4` test cases.
