The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] + a[4] - 5*target`, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-5` test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains True.**
