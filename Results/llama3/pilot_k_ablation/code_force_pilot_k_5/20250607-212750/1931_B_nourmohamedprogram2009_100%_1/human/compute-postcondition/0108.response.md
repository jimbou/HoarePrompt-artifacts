Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, i is 2, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, current_balance is updated to current_balance + a[2] - target, and if current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, the value of possible is not updated.***
