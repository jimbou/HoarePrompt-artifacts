To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, `i` is equal to `n`, which means it will be out of range for the loop, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 0.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is 0, `possible` is True, `_` is equal to `n` plus 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs**
