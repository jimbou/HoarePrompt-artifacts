Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] - 4*target`, `possible` is False if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` is True, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to include the additional term `a[3] - target`, reflecting the change made by the code. The values of the other variables remain the same, and the number of test cases in stdin has decreased by 1.
