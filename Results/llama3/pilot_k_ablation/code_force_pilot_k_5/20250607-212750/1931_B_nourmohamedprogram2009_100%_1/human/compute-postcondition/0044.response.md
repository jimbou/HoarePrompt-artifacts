Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0]` + `a[1]` + `a[2]` - 3*`target`, if `current_balance` is less than 0, `possible` is False, otherwise `possible` remains True, `_` is 1, and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated to include the third element of the list `a` minus the target value, which is the integer division of the total water by the number of test cases `n`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `possible` is still dependent on the value of `current_balance`, and the input stream `stdin` still contains `t-4` test cases.
