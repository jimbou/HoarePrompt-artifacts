Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs. If a[0] is less than the target, then possible is False. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
