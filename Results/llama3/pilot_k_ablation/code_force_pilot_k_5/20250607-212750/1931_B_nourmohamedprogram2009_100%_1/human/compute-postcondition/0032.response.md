To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `_` and `t`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `_` is less than `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, `_` is 0 and `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive. For the loop to execute again, `_` needs to be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `_` is 1
* `t` is still an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, but since `_` has been incremented, `t` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables (`n`, `i`, `a`, `total_water`, `target`, `current_balance`, and `stdin`) are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, `i` is `n`, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is the sum of all elements in `a` minus `n` times `target`, and `_` is 1, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
