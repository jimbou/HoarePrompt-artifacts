Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, n is an integer, a is a list of integers, total_water is an integer, target is an integer, current_balance is 0, possible is True, _ is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    current_balance += a[i] - target
    if current_balance < 0:
        possible = False
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True if `current_balance` is not less than 0, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target`, `possible` is True if `a[0] + a[1] - 2*target` is not less than 0, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target`, `possible` is False if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target` is less than 0, otherwise `possible` is True, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] - 4*target` is less than 0, then `possible` is False, otherwise the state of the program remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `current_balance` is increased by `a[4] - target` and `possible` is False. Otherwise, `current_balance` is increased by `a[4] - target` and the state of the program remains unchanged, except that if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] + a[3] - 4*target` is less than 0, then `possible` is False.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
