Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `target` is the integer division of `total_water` by `n`, `current_balance` is `a[0] - target`, `possible` is True, `_` is equal to `n` plus 1, `t` is an integer between 2 and 10^4 inclusive, `i` is 0, stdin contains 0 inputs. The current value of `current_balance` is less than 0***
