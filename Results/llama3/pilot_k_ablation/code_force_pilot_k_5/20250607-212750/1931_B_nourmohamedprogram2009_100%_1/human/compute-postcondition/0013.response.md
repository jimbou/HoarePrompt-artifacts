Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 10^4 inclusive, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of integers, `total_water` is an integer, `target` is an integer, `current_balance` is `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target`, `possible` is True if `a[0] + a[1] + a[2] - 3*target` is not less than 0, otherwise `possible` is False, `_` is 0, stdin contains t-2 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `current_balance` has been updated by adding `a[2] - target` to its previous value. The value of `possible` has also been updated based on the new value of `current_balance`. If `current_balance` is less than 0, then `possible` is False. Otherwise, `possible` remains unchanged. The values of the other variables remain the same.
