Postcondition: ***n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of integers, total_water is the sum of all elements in a, target is the integer division of total_water by n, i is less than n+1, t is greater than n+1+1, _ is equal to n+1+1, current_balance is either increased by a[i] - target or decreased by target - a[i]. If current_balance is less than 0, then possible is False. Otherwise, possible remains unchanged.***
