Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of finding the final score of a game played between Alice and Bob. The game involves picking elements from an array and appending them to another array, with the goal of maximizing or minimizing the MEX (minimum excludant) of the resulting array.

The program uses a frequency count array `cntl` to keep track of the occurrences of each element in the input array `a`. It then iterates through the frequency count array to find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the input sequence or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in the sequence.

The program's logic is based on the fact that Alice wants to maximize the MEX, while Bob wants to minimize it. By finding the smallest positive integer that is not present in the input sequence or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in the sequence, the program effectively determines the optimal strategy for both players.

The program's execution summary matches its intended behavior, and it correctly handles different test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
