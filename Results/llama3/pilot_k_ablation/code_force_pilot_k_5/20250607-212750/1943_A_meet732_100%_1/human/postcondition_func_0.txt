This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of a single integer n followed by n integers. It then finds the smallest positive integer that is not present in the input sequence or the smallest positive integer that appears only once in the sequence, and prints this integer. If no such integer is found, it prints 0. The function processes all test cases and prints the corresponding results.
