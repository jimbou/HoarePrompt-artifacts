Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `cntl[0]` is less than 2, the value of `j` which is 1 has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement and the value of `j` which is 2 has been printed. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `cntl[j]` is less than 2, `c` is 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` which is `n + 1` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `cntl[j]` is not 0 but less than 2, `c` is 1, and if `c` is not 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2, 1 or 0 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2, 1 or 0 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is not 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
