Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is -1 and if `c` is false, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 or 1, `c` is decreased by 1 and if `c` is false, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
