Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is decreased by 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is -1 and if `c` is false, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 or 1, `c` is decreased by 1 and if `c` is false, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decreased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions for breaking out of the loop or if statement are still dependent on the value of `cntl[j]`.
