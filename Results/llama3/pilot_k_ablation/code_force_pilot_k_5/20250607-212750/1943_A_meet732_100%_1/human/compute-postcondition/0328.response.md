Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `a` still contains at least `n` integers, the variable `i` now holds the last integer from the list `a`, and the list `cntl` has been updated such that the element at the index equal to the last integer in `a` is now `n`, and all other elements in `cntl` are 0. The state of stdin remains empty.
