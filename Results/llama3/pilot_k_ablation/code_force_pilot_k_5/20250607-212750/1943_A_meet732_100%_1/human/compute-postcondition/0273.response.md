Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains no input, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The value of `n` is still at least 2, `a` is still a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is still a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is still the last integer in the list, `c` is still either 1 or 2, stdin still contains no input, and `j` is still 2.
