Output State: **`n` is at least `n`, `j` is `n`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop has iterated over all the elements in the list `a` and has checked the count of each element in the list `cntl`. If an element in `cntl` has a count less than 2, the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the count is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the count is 1, the variable `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
