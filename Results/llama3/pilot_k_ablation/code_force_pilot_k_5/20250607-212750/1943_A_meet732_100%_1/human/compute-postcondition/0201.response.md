Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is either 1 or `cntl[0] - 1` whichever is smaller. If `c` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
