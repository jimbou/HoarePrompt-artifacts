Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the output state will have the same integer value for `n`, the same list of integers for `a`, and the same list of counts for `cntl`, but with each count updated to reflect the actual occurrences of each integer in list `a`. The variable `i` will hold the last integer in list `a`. The stdin remains unchanged as it contains no input.
