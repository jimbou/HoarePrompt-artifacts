The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the fourth element of `a`. The initial value of `cntl[i]` is 3, so the new value of `cntl[i]` is 4. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `cntl` is a list of at least 4 integers where the element at index `i` is 4 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the fourth element of `a`.**
