Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, 1 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 1, no action is taken.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it is now either 0 or 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
