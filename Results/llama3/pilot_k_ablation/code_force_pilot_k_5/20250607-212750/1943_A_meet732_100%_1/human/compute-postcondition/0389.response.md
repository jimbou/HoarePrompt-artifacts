Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 1, 0 or -1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The value of `j` which is 2 has been printed.
