Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]`, whichever is smaller. This is because the `min` function returns the smallest of the two values passed to it. The rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains no input.
