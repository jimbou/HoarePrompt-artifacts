The only variables in the loop head are variables `_` and `input()`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `input()`. If `input()` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, stdin contains multiple test cases does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to `input()` is greater than 0 and `_` is now 0.
State: **stdin contains multiple test cases, `_` is 0, `input()` must be greater than 0**
