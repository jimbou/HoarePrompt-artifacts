The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is the last integer in the list, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `j`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `j`, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `j` is the last integer in the list plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, no additional changes are made.**
