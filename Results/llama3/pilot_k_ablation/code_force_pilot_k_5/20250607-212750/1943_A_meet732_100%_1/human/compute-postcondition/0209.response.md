Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, `c` is decreased by 1, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. The value of `j`, which is 3, is being printed.
