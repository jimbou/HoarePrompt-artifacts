The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 4 integers the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 integers and the `i` is the fourth integer in `a`. 
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 3 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**
