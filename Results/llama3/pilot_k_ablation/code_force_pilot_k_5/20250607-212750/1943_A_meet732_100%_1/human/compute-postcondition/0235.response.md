Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, stdin contains no input, and `j` is `n`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` which is `n` has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is either 1 or `cntl[0]-1` whichever is smaller. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is `n` is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**

This output state means that the loop has executed all its iterations, and the value of `j` has reached `n`. The loop has checked all elements in the list `a` and has printed the first element that appears less than twice in the list. If no such element is found, the loop has printed the last element of the list. The value of `c` has been updated accordingly, and the loop has terminated.
