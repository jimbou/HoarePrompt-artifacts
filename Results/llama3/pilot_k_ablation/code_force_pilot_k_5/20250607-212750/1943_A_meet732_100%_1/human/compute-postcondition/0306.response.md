Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `j` is 5, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `j` which is 5 has been printed. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, and `i` do not change. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
