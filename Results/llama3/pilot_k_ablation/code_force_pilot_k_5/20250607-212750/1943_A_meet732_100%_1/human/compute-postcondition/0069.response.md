Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `j`, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `j` is the last integer in the list plus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
