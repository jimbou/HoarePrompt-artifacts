Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 1, 0 or -1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is 2**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 3, the list `a` still contains at least `n` integers, the last integer in `a` is still `i`, the list `cntl` still contains `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, the value of `c` is decreased by 1, so it can be 1, 0 or -1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, the standard input is still empty, and the value of `j` is still 2.
