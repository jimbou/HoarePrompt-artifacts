Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is 1, `cntl[j]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still at least 1, `j` is still 1, `a` is still a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is still a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is still the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is still 1, and `cntl[j]` is still 0. However, we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
