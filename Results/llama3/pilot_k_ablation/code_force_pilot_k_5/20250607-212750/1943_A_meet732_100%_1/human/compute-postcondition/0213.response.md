The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 4**
