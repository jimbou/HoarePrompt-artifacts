The only variables in the loop head are variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a. If the list a has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where all elements are 0, stdin contains no input. So for the loop to be executed  the list a must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers that must have at least 1 integer, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where all elements are 0, i is the first integer in the list, stdin contains no input**
