To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.


The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means the loop iterates over the elements of list `a`. The state at the end of the previous iteration is:


`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where all elements are 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 3, `i` is the third integer in the list, stdin contains no input


Since the loop iterates over the elements of list `a`, we need to adjust the state of `a` and `i` to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.


At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the third integer in the list. For the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least 4 integers, and `i` should be the fourth integer in the list.


The state of `n` is not directly affected by the loop head, so it remains an integer. The state of `cntl` is also not directly affected, so it remains a list of `n+1` integers where all elements are 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 3.


The state of stdin is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.


Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:


State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 4 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where all elements are 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 3, `i` is the fourth integer in the list, stdin contains no input**
