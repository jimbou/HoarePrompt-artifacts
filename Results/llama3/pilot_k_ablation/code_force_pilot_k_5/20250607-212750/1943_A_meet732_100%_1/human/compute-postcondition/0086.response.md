The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the third integer in the list `a`, and `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first integer is 1 and the rest are zeros except for the third integer which is 1, the third integer in `cntl` is 1. After incrementing it by 1, the third integer in `cntl` becomes 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first integer is 1, the third integer is 2, and the rest are zeros, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the third integer in the list**
