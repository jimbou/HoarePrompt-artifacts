The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, and `j` is 3**
