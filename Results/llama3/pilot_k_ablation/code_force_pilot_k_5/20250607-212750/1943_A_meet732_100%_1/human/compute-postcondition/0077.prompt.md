Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, 1 is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 1, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is either 0 or 1. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is 1, no action is taken. If `cntl[j]` is greater than 1, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than `j`, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `j` is the last integer in the list plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, no additional changes are made. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is a positive integer greater than `j`, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0, 1 or 2, `j` is the last integer in the list plus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is not 0, no additional changes are made. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, no additional changes are made.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
