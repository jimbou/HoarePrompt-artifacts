Output: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 2, and the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed**
