Postcondition: ***n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is the number of times i appears in a and the rest are 0, stdin contains no input, i is the last element of a. If cntl[0] is 0, the number 0 is being printed. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is the number of times i appears in a and the rest are 0, i is the last element of a, cntl[0] is not equal to 0. If cntl[j] is less than 2, then if cntl[j] is 0, the value of j which is n has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, c is either 1 or cntl[0]-1 whichever is smaller. If c is 0, the value of j which is n is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
