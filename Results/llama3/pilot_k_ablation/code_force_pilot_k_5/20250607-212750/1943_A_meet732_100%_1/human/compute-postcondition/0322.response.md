The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 2 integers, i is the second integer in a. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the i is the third integer in a.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**
