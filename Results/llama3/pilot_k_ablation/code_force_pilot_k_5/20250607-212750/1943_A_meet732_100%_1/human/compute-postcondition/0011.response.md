Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the fifth element is 5 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the fifth integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so the fifth element of the list `cntl` is now 5, while the rest of the elements remain 0. The other variables, including `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
