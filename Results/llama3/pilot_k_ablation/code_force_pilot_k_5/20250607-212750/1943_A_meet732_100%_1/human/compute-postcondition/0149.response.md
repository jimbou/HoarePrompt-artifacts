Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `j` is 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decreased by 1, but its initial value is unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and `i` is still the last integer in the list `a`. The list `cntl` still contains `n+1` integers, and `j` is still 5. The value of `n` is still at least 5.
