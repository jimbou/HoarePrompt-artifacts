Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0, 1 or 2, `j` is `n+1`, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. If `cntl[j]` is 0 for any `j` in the range from 1 to `n`, the value of `j` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is 0 for any `j` in the range from 1 to `n`, the value of `j` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is not 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `n`, no additional changes are made.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all its iterations, the state of the variables remains largely unchanged, except for the loop counter `j` which reaches `n+1`. The loop iterates over all possible values of `j` from 1 to `n`, and for each `j`, it checks the conditions specified in the loop body. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and the loop breaks. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and the loop breaks. If neither of these conditions is met for all `j` in the range, no additional changes are made.
