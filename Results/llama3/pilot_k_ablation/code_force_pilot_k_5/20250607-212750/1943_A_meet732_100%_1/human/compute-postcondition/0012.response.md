Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the list `a` will be empty because all its elements have been processed. The list `cntl` will contain the count of each integer in the original list `a`, where the `i-th` element in `cntl` represents the number of times `i` appears in `a`. The other variables, `n` and `stdin`, remain unchanged.
