Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 5 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 1 plus the fourth integer in the list `a`, the fifth integer is 1 plus the fifth integer in the list `a`, and the rest are zeros, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the fifth integer in the list `a`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of the fifth element in the list `cntl` has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` now has a value of 1 plus the fifth integer in the list `a` at its fifth index.
