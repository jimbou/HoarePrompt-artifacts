Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `c` is either 1 or 2 because `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0 and `min(2, cntl[0])` will return either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
