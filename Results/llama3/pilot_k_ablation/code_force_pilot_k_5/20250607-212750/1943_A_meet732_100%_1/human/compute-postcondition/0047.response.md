Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next statement outside the loop or if statement. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers.
