Output: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is 1, the current value of `cntl[j]` is 0, and all other conditions from the precondition still hold, and the value of `j` which is 1 is being printed**
