Output: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is -1 if `cntl[j]` is 1, otherwise `c` is decreased by 1, If `cntl[j]` is 0 or 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `c` being -1 if `cntl[j]` is 1, and the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed**
