Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `j` is 1, and `cntl[j]` is greater than 0.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it is now either 0 or 1. The values of the other variables remain the same. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. The current value of `j` is still 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is still greater than 0.
