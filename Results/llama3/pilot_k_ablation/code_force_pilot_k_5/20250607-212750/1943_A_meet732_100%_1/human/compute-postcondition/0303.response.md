The only variable in the loop head is variable `j`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 4, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 5.
State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `j` is 5**
