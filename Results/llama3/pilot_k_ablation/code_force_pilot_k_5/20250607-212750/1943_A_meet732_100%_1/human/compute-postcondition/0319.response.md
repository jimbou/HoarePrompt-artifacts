The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the first integer in `a`, `cntl[i]` was initially 0, so its new value is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin is still empty.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**
