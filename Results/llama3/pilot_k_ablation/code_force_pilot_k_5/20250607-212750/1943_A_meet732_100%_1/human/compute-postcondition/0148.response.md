Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `j` is 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `j`, `a`, `cntl`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement.
