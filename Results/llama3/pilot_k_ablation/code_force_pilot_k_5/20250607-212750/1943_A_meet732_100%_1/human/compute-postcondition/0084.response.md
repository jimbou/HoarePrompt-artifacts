Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first integer is 1 and the rest are zeros except for the third integer which is 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the second integer in the list**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the second integer in the list `a`. Since `i` is the second integer, it means `cntl[2]` has been incremented by 1, making it 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
