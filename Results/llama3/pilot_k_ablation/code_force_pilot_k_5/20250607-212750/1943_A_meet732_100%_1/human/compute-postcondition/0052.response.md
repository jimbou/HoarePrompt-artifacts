Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
