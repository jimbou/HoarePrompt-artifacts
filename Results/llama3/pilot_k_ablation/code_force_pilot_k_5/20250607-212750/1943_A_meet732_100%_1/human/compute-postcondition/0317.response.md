Output State: **n is an integer from stdin, a is a list of n integers from stdin, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin is empty**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from stdin to `a`. The third line initializes `cntl` as a list of `n+1` zeros. After the execution of the code, `n` and `a` are updated with new values from stdin, and `cntl` is initialized with zeros. Stdin is now empty since all inputs have been consumed.
