Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `j` is 5, `c` is decreased by 1**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` is decreased by 1, while the values of `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
