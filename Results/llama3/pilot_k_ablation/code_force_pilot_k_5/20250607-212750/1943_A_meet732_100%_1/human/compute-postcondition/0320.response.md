The only variables in the loop head are variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 1 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**
