Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is 0, `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is more than 0, stdin contains no input***
