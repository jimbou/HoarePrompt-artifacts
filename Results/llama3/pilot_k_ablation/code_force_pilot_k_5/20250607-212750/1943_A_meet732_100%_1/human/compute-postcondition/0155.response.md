Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 5, `j` is 5, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
