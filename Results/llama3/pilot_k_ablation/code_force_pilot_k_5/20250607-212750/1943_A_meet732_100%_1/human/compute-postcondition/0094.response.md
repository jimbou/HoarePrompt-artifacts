Output: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` integer is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0, meaning the number of occurrences of 0 in the list `a` is 0, and the number 0 is being printed**
