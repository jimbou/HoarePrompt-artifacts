To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The objects involved are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the last integer in `a`, which means `j` is equal to `n`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n + 1`. However, since the loop condition is `j` in `range(1, n + 1)`, `j` cannot exceed `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than its current value.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `cntl[0]` is less than 2, the value of `j` which is 2 has been printed, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, `j` is 2**
