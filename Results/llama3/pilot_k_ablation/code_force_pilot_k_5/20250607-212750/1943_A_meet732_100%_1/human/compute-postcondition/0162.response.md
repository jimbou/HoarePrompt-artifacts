To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved accordingly.

The loop head is `for i in a:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is the first element of `a`. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be the next element in `a`. Since `a` is a list of `n` integers, we can assume that `i` will be the second element of `a` at the start of the next iteration.

The state of `a` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop head.

The other variables, `n`, `cntl`, and `stdin`, are not involved in the loop head and therefore do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the second element of `a`**
