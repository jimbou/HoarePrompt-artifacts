Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is 0. The current value of `cntl[j]` is more than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values, and the only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `j` which is 1 has been printed.
