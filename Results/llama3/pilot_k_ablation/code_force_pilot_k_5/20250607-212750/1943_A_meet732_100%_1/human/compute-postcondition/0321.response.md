Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. The list `cntl` still has n+1 integers, but the value at index `i` has been updated to 2. The stdin remains empty.
