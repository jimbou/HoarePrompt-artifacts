Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` integer is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. If the number of occurrences of 0 in the list `a` is 0, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if the number of occurrences of `j` in the list `a` is less than 2, then if the number of occurrences of `j` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
