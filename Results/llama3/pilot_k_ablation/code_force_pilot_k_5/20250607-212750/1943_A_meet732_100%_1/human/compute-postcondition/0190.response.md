Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is either 1 or `cntl[0]-1` whichever is smaller. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
