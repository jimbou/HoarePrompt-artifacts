Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `j` which is 2 has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The program has broken out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `j` which is 2 has been printed. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `i`, `cntl`, and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin is still empty.
