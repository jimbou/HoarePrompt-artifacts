Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 0 because `cntl[0]` is less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0, and the value of `j` which is 1 has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The value of `j` which is 1 has been printed. The other variables remain the same as in the initial state.
