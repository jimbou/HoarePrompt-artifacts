The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a list of `n` integers, `i` is the second element of `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `i` is the third element of `a`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of at least 4 integers where the element at index `i` is 2 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the third element of `a`**
