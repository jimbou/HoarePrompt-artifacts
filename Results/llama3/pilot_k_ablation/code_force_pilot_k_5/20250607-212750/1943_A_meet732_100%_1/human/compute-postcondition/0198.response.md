Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 1 or `cntl[0] - 1` whichever is smaller, and `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means the execution of the program will continue from the next line of code outside the loop or if statement.
