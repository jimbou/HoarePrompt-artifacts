Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is 2 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the second element of `a`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl` at index `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
