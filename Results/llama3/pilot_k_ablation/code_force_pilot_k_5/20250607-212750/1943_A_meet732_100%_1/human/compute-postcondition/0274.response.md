Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is either 0, `j` is 2, stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it can now be either 0, since it was initially either 1 or 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
