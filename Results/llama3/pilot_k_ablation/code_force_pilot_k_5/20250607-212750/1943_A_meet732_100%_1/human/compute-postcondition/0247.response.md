The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and list  a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list has at least 5 integers the loop executes again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, a has at least 4 integers, i is the fourth integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 5 integers and the i is the fifth integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 5 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where all elements are 0 except `cntl[3]` which is 4, `i` is the fifth integer in the list, stdin contains no input**
