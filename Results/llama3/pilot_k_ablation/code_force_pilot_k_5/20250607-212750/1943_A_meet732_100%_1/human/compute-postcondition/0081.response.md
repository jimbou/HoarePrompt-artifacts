According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a`. If `a` is not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not defined. So for the loop to be executed  the list `a` must have at least 1 integer and `i` is the first integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 zeros, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the first integer in the list**
