To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains no input, `j` is 1**
