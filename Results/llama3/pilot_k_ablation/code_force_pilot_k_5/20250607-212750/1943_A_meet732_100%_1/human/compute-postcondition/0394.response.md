Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n`, stdin is empty. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, `c` is 0, `j` is `n`, and all other elements in `cntl` are not 0.***
