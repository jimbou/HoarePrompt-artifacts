Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is -1 if `cntl[j]` is 1, otherwise `c` is decreased by 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `j` which is 2 is being printed.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `j`, `a`, `cntl`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `c` is still dependent on the value of `cntl[j]`, and its value is either -1 or decreased by 1. The most notable change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `j` (which is 2) is being printed.
