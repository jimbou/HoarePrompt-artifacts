Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `j` is 3, and `c` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decreased by 1, while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and the list `cntl` still contains the count of occurrences of each integer in `a`. The value of `i` is still the last integer in the list, and the value of `j` is still 3. The stdin still contains no input.
