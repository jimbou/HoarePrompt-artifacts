Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first integer is 1, the third integer is 2, the fourth integer is 1 plus the fourth integer in the list `a`, and the rest are zeros, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
