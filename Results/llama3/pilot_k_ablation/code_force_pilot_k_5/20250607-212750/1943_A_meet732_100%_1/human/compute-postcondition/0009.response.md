Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n-1` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 4 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the fourth integer in the list.**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, making it 4, while the rest of the elements in the `cntl` list remain 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
