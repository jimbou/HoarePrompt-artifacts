To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1, because the range starts from 1 and goes up to `n + 1`. This means `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Since `j` is the loop variable, it will start from 1.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, stdin contains no input, `j` is 1**
