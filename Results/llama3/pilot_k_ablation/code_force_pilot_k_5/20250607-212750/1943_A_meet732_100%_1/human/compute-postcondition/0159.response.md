Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains no input, i is undefined**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `a`. The third line initializes `cntl` as a list of `n+1` zeros. After these operations, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is no longer defined.
