Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains multiple test cases. The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5). The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (0 <= a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    cntl = [(0) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    for i in a:
        cntl[i] += 1
    if cntl[0] == 0:
        print(0)
    else:
        c = min(2, cntl[0])
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if cntl[j] < 2:
                if cntl[j] == 0:
                    print(j)
                    break
                else:
                    c -= 1
                    if not c:
                        print(j)
                        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list. If `cntl[0]` is 0, 0 is printed. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, then for all `j` in the range from 1 to `n`, if `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is not 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `n`, no additional changes are made.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` integer is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. If the number of occurrences of 0 in the list `a` is 0, then the number 0 is printed. Otherwise, if the number of occurrences of `j` in the list `a` is less than 2, then if the number of occurrences of `j` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is the number of times i appears in a and the rest are 0, stdin contains no input, i is the last element of a. If cntl[0] is 0, the number 0 is being printed. Otherwise, n is an integer greater than 0, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is the number of times i appears in a and the rest are 0, i is the last element of a, cntl[0] is not equal to 0. If cntl[j] is less than 2, then if cntl[j] is 0, the value of j which is n has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, c is either 1 or cntl[0]-1 whichever is smaller. If c is 0, the value of j which is n is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains no input. If `cntl[0]` is 0, 0 is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is at least 1, `c` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is `n+1`, then if `cntl[j]` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is more than 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n`, stdin is empty. If `cntl[0]` is 0, then 0 is printed. Otherwise, `c` is 0, `j` is `n`, and all other elements in `cntl` are not 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
