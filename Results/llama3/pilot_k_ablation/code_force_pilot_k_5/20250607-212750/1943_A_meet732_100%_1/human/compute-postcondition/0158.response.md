To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`.

The only object in the loop head that can be adjusted is the input from `stdin`. Since `stdin` contains no inputs at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `stdin` must contain at least one input.

State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` integer is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains at least one input, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`.**
