The value of `c` is decremented by 1. The value of `c` can be either 2 or 1, so the new value of `c` is 1 or 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is either 1 or 0 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is 1, and the current value of `cntl[j]` is greater than 0.
