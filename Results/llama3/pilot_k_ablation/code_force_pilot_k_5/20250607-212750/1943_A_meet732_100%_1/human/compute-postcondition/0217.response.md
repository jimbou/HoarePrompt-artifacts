Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 4, and `c` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `c` is decreased by 1, while all other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and the list `cntl` still keeps track of the count of each integer in `a`. The last element of `a` is still `i`, and the first element of `cntl` is still not equal to 0. The value of `j` is still 4.
