The only objects in the loop head are variables  `a` and `i`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`.  If the list has at least 4 elements the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 elements and the `i` is the fourth element of `a`.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `cntl` is a list of at least 4 integers where the element at index `i` is 3 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the fourth element of `a`**
