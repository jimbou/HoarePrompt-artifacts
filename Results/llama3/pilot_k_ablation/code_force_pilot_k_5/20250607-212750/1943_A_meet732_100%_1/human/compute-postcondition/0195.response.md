Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 1 or `cntl[0] - 1` whichever is smaller, `j` is 2, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1. Since `c` was either 2 or `cntl[0]` (whichever is smaller), it is now either 1 or `cntl[0] - 1` (whichever is smaller). The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
