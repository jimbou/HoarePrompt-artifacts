Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains no input. If `cntl[0]` is 0, 0 is printed. Otherwise, if `n` is at least 1, `c` is either 1 or 2, and `j` is `n+1`, then if `cntl[j]` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is more than 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
