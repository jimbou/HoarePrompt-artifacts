The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `a`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 integers the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 integers and the `i` is the third integer in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first integer is 1 and the rest are zeros except for the third integer which is 1, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the third integer in the list**
