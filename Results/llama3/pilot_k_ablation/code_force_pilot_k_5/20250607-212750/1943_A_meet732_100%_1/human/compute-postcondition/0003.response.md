The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the first integer in the list `a` and `a` is a list of `n` integers, `i` is an integer between 0 and `n-1`. The value of `cntl[i]` was initially 0, so after incrementing, it becomes 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must not be empty, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the first integer in the list.**
