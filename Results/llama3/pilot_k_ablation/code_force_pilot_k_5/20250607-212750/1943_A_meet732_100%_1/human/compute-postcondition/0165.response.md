Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `cntl` is a list of at least 4 integers where the element at index `i` is 3 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the third element of `a`**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `cntl` still has at least 4 integers, but the element at index `i` is now 3 instead of 2. The rest of the elements in `cntl` are still 0. The values of `n`, `a`, `stdin`, and `i` are the same as in the initial state.
