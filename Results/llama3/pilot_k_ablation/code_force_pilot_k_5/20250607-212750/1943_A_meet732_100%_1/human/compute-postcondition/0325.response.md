The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `cntl[i]` was 3, so the new value of `cntl[i]` is 4. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin is still empty.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 4 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**
