Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, `j` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, `cntl[0]`, `c`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `j` which is 2 has been printed.
