Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` integer is the number of occurrences of `i` in the list `a`, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the state of the variables is as follows: the value of `n` remains unchanged, the list `a` remains unchanged, the list `cntl` now contains the count of each integer in the list `a`, with the `i-th` index containing the count of the integer `i`, the standard input `stdin` still contains no inputs, and the variable `i` now holds the value of the last integer in the list `a`.
