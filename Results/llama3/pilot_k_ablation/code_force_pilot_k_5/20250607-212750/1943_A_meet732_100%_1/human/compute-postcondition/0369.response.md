Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty. If `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` which is `n + 1` has been printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is 1, and if `c` is not 0, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
