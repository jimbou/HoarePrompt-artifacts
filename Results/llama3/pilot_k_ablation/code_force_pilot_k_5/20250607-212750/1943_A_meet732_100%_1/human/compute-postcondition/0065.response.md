Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than `j`, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `j` is the last integer in the list plus 1, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `c` is not 0, no additional changes are made. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, no additional changes are made.***
