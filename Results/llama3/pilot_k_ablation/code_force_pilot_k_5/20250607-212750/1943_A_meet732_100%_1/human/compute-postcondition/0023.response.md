Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `j` is 1, `cntl[j]` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `i`, and stdin remain unchanged. The value of `j` is still 1, and the value of `cntl[j]` is still 0. Additionally, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.
