Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, stdin contains no input.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if cntl[j] < 2:
        if cntl[j] == 0:
            print(j)
            break
        else:
            c -= 1
            if not c:
                print(j)
                break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` is either 2 or `cntl[0]` whichever is smaller, stdin contains no input, and `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, then if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is greater than or equal to 1, `c` is either 1 or `cntl[0]-1` whichever is smaller. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 1 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 2. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is either 1 or `cntl[0] - 1` whichever is smaller. If `c` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, if `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional actions are taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 4. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 5. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, the value of `j` which is 5 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement if `cntl[j]` is 0. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is not zero, the program continues to execute. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
