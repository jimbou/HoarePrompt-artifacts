Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `j` is 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is 0. The current value of `cntl[j]` is more than 0**

The code decrements the value of `c` by 1. Since `c` was initially 1, its new value is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
