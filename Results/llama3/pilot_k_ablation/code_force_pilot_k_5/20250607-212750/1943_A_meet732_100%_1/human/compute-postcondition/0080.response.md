Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 zeros, stdin contains no inputs, i is not defined**

The code block consists of three lines. The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. The second line assigns a list of `n` integers from the input to `a`. The third line creates a list `cntl` of `n+1` zeros.

After the code executes, `n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, and `cntl` is a list of `n+1` zeros. The variable `i` is not defined in the code block, so it is not included in the output state. The stdin is empty after the code executes, as all inputs have been consumed.
