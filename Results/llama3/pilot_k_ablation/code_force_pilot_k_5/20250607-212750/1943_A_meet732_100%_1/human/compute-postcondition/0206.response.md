Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and `c` is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, all variables retain their initial values except for `c`, which has been decremented by 1. The list `a` still contains `n` integers, and the list `cntl` still tracks the frequency of each integer in `a`. The value of `i` remains the last element of `a`, and `cntl[0]` is still not equal to 0. Additionally, `j` remains 3.
