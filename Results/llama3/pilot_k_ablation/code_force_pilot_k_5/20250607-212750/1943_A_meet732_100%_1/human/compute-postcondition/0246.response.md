Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 4 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where all elements are 0 except `cntl[3]` which is 4, `i` is the fourth integer in the list, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, where `i` is the fourth integer in the list `a`. Since `i` is the fourth integer, `cntl[i]` is actually `cntl[3]`, which was initially 3 and is now 4. The other variables remain unchanged.
