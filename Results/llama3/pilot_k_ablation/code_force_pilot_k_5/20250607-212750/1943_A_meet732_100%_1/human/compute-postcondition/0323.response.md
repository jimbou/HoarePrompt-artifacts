The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. Since `cntl[i]` is 2, its new value is 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin remains empty.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 3 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**
