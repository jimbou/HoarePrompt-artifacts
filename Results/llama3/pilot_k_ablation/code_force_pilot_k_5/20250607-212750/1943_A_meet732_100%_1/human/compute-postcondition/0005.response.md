The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the second integer in the list. The values of the other variables are not affected. `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 2 and the rest are 0. The stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n-1` integers that must not be empty, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 2 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the second integer in the list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n-1` integers that must not be empty, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 2 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the second integer in the list.**
