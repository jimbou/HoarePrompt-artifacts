The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the first integer in the list `a`. The value of `cntl[i]` was initially 0, so it is now 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 1 integer, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where the first integer is 1 and the rest are zeros, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the first integer in the list**
