To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in range(1, n + 1):`, so we can only adjust the state of `j` and `n`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is not specified, but we know that `n` is at least 3.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Since `j` is in the range `1` to `n + 1`, the next value of `j` would be `2` (assuming the previous value of `j` was `1`).

The state of `n` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not changed by the loop.

The other variables `a`, `i`, `cntl`, `c`, and `stdin` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2, 1 or 0 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is 2**
