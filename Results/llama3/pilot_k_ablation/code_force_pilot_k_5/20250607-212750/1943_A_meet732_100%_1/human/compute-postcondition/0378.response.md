Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is `n + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, all variables maintain their initial values and properties. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which does not affect the values of the variables.
