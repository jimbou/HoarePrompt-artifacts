Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 1 or 0 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is `n + 1`**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1. Since `c` was initially 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, it is now 1 or 0 respectively. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
