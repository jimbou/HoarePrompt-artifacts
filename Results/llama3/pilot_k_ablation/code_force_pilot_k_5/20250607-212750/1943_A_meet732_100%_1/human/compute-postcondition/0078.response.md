Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list. If `cntl[0]` is 0, 0 is printed. If `cntl[0]` is not 0, then for all `j` in the range from 1 to `n`, if `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is 0, the value of `j` is printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 and `c` is not 0 for all `j` in the range from 1 to `n`, no additional changes are made.***
