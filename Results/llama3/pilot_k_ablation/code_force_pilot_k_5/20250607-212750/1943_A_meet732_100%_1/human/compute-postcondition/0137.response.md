Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `j` which is 4 has been printed. The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside.
