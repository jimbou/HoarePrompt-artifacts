To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is the last integer in `a`, which is not explicitly stated but can be inferred to be `n` since `a` has at least `n` integers. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `n + 1`.

However, since the loop condition is `j` in `range(1, n + 1)`, `j` cannot exceed `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than its current value.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2 or 1 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty, `j` is `n + 1`**
