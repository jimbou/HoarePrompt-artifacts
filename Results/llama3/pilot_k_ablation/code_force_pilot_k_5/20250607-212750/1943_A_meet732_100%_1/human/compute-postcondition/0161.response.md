The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the first element of `a`. The value of `cntl` is a list of `n+1` zeros. The value of `n` is at least 1. The value of `a` is a list of `n` integers. The value of `stdin` contains no input. The value of `i` is the first element of `a`. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first element of `a`.
Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains no input, `i` is the first element of `a`.**
