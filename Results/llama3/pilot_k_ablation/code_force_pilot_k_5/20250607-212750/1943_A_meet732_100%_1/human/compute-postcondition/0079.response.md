The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `int(input())`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `int(input())`. If `int(input())` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `int(input())` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time `int(input())` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 1 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list**
