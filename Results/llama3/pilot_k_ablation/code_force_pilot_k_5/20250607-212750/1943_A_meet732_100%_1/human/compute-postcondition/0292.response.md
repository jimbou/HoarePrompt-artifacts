To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head `for j in range(1, n + 1):`. The only variable in the loop head that can be adjusted is `j`.

According to the loop head, `j` takes values from 1 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented to the next value in the range.

Since `n` is at least 2, the next value of `j` after 3 would be 4, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 4.

The other variables (`n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, and `c`) are not directly affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `j` is 4, `c` is the same value as before (its value is not specified, but it is not changed by the loop head)**
