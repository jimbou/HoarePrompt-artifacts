Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `j` is 3, and the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as in the initial state. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
