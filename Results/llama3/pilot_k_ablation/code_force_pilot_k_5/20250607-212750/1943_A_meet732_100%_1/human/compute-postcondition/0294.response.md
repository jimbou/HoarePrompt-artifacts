Output: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `j` is 4, `c` is the same value as before (its value is not specified, but it is not changed by the loop head), and the value of `j` which is 4 is being printed**
