Output: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list. The current value of `cntl[0]` is 0, meaning that the number 0 does not appear in the original list `a`, and 0 is being printed**
