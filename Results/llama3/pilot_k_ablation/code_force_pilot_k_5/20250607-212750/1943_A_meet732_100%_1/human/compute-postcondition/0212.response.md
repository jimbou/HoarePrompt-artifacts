Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, and `j` is 3. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, if `cntl[j]` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 has been printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `c` is decreased by 1. If `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no additional actions are taken.***
