Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is either 0 or 1, `j` is 1. The current value of `cntl[j]` is more than 0, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it can now be either 0 or 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
