Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains no input, `j` is 1. If `cntl[j]` is 0 or `cntl[j]` is more than 0 and `c` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
