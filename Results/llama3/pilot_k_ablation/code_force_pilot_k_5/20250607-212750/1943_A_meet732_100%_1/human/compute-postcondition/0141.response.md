Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `j` is 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is decreased by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `j`, `a`, `cntl`, and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `c` is still decreased by 1, and the value of `j` which is 4 has been printed. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
