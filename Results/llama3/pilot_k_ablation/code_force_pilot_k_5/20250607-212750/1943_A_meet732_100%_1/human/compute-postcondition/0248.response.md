The code `cntl[i] += 1` increments the value of `cntl[i]` by 1. Since `i` is the fifth integer in the list `a`, `cntl[i]` is actually `cntl[4]`. Initially, all elements of `cntl` are 0 except `cntl[3]` which is 4. Therefore, `cntl[4]` is 0 and after the increment, it becomes 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer, `a` is still a list of `n` integers with at least 5 integers, and `cntl` is still a list of `n+1` integers with all elements 0 except `cntl[3]` which is 4 and `cntl[4]` which is now 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers with at least 5 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where all elements are 0 except `cntl[3]` which is 4 and `cntl[4]` which is 1, `i` is the fifth integer in the list, stdin contains no input**
