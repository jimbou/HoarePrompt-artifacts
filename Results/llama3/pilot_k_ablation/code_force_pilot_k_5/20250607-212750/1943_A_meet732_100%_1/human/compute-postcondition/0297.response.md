Based on the initial state, the code `print(j)` will print the value of `j`, which is 4.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

* `n` is an integer that must be at least 4, but its exact value is not specified.
* `a` is a list of `n` integers, but its contents are not specified.
* `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`. However, this information is not relevant to the print statement.
* `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, but its value is not specified.
* `j` is 4, which is a constant value.
* `c` is the same value as before minus 1, but this variable is not used in the print statement.

Since `j` is a constant value of 4, the print statement will simply output this value.

Output: **4**
