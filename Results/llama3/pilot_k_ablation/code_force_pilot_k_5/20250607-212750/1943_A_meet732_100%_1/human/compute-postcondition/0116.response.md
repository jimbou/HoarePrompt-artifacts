Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, `c` is -1 if `cntl[j]` is 1, otherwise `c` is decreased by 1, If `cntl[j]` is 0 or 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `c` being -1 if `cntl[j]` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decreased by 1, but if `cntl[j]` is 1, then `c` is now -1. The other variables remain unchanged. The condition for breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement is still valid, but the value of `c` has been updated.
