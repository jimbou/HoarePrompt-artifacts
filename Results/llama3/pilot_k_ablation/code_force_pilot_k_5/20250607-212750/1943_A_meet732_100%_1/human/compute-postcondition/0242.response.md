Output State: **`n` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers that must have at least 2 integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where all elements are 0 except `cntl[i]` which is 2, `i` is the second integer in the list, stdin contains no input**

In this output state, the value of `cntl[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. The other variables remain unchanged. The list `a` still has `n` integers, and `i` is still the second integer in the list. The stdin still contains no input.
