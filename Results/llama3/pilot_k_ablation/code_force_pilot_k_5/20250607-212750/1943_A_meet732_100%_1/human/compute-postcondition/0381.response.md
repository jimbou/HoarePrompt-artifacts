Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 2, 1 or 0 depending on whether `cntl[0]` is 2 or less than 2, stdin is empty. If `cntl[j]` is less than 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues to execute.***
