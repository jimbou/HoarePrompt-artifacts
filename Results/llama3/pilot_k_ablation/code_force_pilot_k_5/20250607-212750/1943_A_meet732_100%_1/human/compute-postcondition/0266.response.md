Output State: **`n` is an integer that must be at least 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where each element `cntl[i]` is the count of occurrences of `i` in list `a`, `i` is the last integer in the list, `c` is 0, `j` is 1, the value of `cntl[j]` is more than 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `i`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged. The only change is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement.
