Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 1, stdin is empty, `j` is `n + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

The value of `j` which is `n + 1` has been printed.
