Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the value of `j` which is 3 has been printed.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` is still greater than 0, the list `a` still contains `n` integers, the list `cntl` still contains `n+1` integers where each element at index `i` represents the count of `i` in list `a`, the value of `i` is still the last element of `a`, the first element of `cntl` is still not equal to 0, the value of `j` is still 3, and the value of `j` which is 3 has been printed. Also, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
