The only variable in the loop head is variable  i, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is the next integer in `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the fourth integer in `a`, `a` has at least 4 integers. So for the loop to be executed one more time `a` must have at least 5 integers and `i` is the fifth integer in `a`.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `a` is a list of at least 5 integers, `i` is the fifth integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of n+1 integers where `cntl[i]` is 4 and all other elements are 0, stdin is empty**
