Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `j`, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 0 or 1, `j` is the last integer in the list plus 2, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `cntl`, `c`, and `j` remain unchanged, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs. The only change is that we exit the current loop or if statement.
