Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is an empty list, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is the number of times `i` appears in the original list `a`, `c` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the last integer in the list, stdin contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers.**

The value of `c` is assigned the minimum of 2 and `cntl[0]`. Since `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `c` can be either 1 or 2. The values of the other variables are not affected.
