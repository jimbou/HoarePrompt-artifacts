The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n+1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. If `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is 1, `c` is -1 and if `c` is false, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `cntl[j]` is not 0 or 1, `c` is decreased by 1 and if `c` is false, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
