Output State: **n is an integer, a is a list of n integers, cntl is a list of n+1 integers where the element at index i is the number of times i appears in a and the rest are 0, stdin contains no input, i is the last element of a.**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of n remains unchanged, the list a remains the same, the list cntl has been updated to reflect the count of each integer in a, the stdin remains empty, and the variable i holds the last element of a.
