Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `j` is 3, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `j`, `a`, `cntl`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, which means that the program will exit the current loop or if statement and continue executing the next line of code.
