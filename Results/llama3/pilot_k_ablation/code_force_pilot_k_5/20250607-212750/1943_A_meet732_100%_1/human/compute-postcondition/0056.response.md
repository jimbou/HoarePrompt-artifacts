Based on the precondition, the value of `j` is the last integer in the list plus 1. However, since the list `a` is empty, there is no last integer, and the value of `j` is not explicitly defined in this context.

But, it is given that if `cntl[j]` is 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `c` is 0, the value of `j` which is 3 is being printed, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

So, the value of `j` is 3 when `c` is 0.

Output: **3**
