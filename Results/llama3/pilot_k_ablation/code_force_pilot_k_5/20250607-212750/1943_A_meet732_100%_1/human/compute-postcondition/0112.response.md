To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `j` is now 2, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables in the state, `a`, `cntl`, `stdin`, `i`, and `c`, are not affected by the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `j` is 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers, `stdin` contains no inputs, `i` is the last integer in the list `a`. If `cntl[j]` is 0 or 1, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, with `c` being 0 if `cntl[j]` is 1. Otherwise, no action is taken.**
