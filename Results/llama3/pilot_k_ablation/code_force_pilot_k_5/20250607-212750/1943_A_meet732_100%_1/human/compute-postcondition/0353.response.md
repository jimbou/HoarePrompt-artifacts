Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `n` integers, `i` is the last integer in `a`, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where `cntl[i]` is `n` and all other elements are not 0, `c` is 1, stdin is empty, `j` is 2**

In this output state, the value of `c` has been decremented by 1, so it is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The program is still in the same state, with `j` being 2, and the stdin is still empty.
