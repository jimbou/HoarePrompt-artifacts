Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 4, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the element at index `i` is the number of times `i` appears in `a` and the rest are 0, `i` is the last element of `a`, `cntl[0]` is not equal to 0, `j` is 5, and `c` is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `n` remains an integer greater than 4. The list `a` still contains `n` integers. The list `cntl` still contains `n+1` integers, where each element at index `i` represents the count of `i` in list `a`, and the rest are 0. The variable `i` is still the last element of list `a`. The first element of `cntl` is still not equal to 0. The value of `j` remains 5. The only change is that the value of `c` has been decreased by 1.
