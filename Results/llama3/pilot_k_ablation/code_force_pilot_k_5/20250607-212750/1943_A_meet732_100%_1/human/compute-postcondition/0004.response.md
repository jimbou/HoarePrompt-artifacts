The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list a.  If the list a has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, a is a list of `n` integers that must not be empty, `i` is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list a must have at least `n-1` elements and the `i` is the second integer in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n-1` integers that must not be empty, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 1 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the second integer in the list.**
