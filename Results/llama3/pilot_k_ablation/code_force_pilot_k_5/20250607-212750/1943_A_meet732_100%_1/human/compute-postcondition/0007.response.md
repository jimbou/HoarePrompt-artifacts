The value of `cntl[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the third integer in the list, and `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 2 and the rest are 0. Therefore, the value of `cntl[i]` is 2 + 1 = 3. The values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n-2` integers that must not be empty, `cntl` is a list of `n+1` integers where the `i-th` element is 3 and the rest are 0, `stdin` contains multiple test cases minus 2 inputs: an integer and a list of `n` integers, `i` is the third integer in the list.**
