Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 2. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
