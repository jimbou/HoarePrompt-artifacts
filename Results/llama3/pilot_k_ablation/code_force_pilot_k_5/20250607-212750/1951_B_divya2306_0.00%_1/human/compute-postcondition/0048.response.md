Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 4`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 6` and less than `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`**

The value of `wins_with_swap` is incremented by 1, so it is now equal to `wins + 6`. The other variables remain unchanged.
