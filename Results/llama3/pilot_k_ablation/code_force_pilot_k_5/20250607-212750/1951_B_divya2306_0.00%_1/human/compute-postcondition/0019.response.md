The code `break` causes the program to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables do not change. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 3, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 4, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 4 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
