To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i`, `wins_with_swap`, and `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

The loop condition is `i` in `range(wins_with_swap, k - 1)`, which means `i` must be less than `k - 1` for the loop to continue. Therefore, `k` must be greater than `i + 1`.

`wins_with_swap` is not directly related to the loop condition, but it is used to initialize the range. Since `i` is incremented, `wins_with_swap` remains the same.

The other variables `n`, `a`, `wins`, and `k` are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 3`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 4` and less than `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap + 1`.**
