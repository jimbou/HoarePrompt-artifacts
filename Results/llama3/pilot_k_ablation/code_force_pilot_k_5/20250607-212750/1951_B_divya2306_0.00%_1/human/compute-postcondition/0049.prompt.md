Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is equal to `n`. If the current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `wins - 1` is being printed.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(wins_with_swap, k - 1):
    if a[i] > a[k - 1]:
        break
    wins_with_swap += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 2` and less than `k - 1`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap - 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 3` and less than `k - 1`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 2`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 4` and less than `k - 1`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 3`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 5` and less than `k - 1`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 4`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 6` and less than `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
