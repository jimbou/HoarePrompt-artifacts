Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 1`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 2` and less than `k - 1`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs.***
