The only variables in the loop head are variables  i, wins_with_swap and k, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `wins_with_swap` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap`, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 3`, `wins_with_swap` is less than `k - 1`. So for the loop to be executed one more time `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap + 1` and `wins_with_swap` is less than `k - 2` and `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 4`. 
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 4`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 5` and less than `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap + 1`**
