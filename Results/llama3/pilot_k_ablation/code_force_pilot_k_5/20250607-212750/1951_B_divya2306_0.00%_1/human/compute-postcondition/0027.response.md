Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 1`, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is equal to `n`. If the current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `wins - 1` is being printed.**

In this output state, the value of `wins_with_swap` has been updated to be one more than the value of `wins`. The other variables remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, and the value of `i` is still equal to `n`. Additionally, if the current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `wins - 1` is being printed.
