Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap + 3`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + 4` and less than `k - 2`, `i` is equal to `wins_with_swap + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, `wins_with_swap`, and `i` remain unchanged. The only effect of the `break` statement is that we exit the innermost loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
