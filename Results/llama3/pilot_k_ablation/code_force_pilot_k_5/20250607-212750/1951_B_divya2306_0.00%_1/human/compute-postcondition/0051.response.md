Output: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer greater than `wins_with_swap`, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is equal to the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + k - wins` and less than or equal to `k - 1`, `i` is equal to `k - 1`. If `a[i]` is greater than `a[k - 1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no action is taken., and this is printed: the maximum value between `wins - 1` and `wins_with_swap - wins - 1 + (wins > 0)`, where `wins` is the number of elements in `a` that are less than or equal to `a[k - 1]`, and `wins_with_swap` is equal to `wins + k - wins` and less than or equal to `k - 1`**
