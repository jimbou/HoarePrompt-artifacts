Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `n`, `k`, `a`, `wins`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains multiple test cases, but one test case has been processed, so it's now multiple test cases - 1. The current value of `a[i]` is still greater than the current value of `a[k - 1]`. The `break` statement causes the program to exit the innermost loop or if statement it's currently in.
