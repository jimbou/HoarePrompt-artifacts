Functionality: **This function determines the maximum number of wins a cow can achieve in a competition. It takes as input the number of cows (n) and the index of the cow of interest (k), as well as a list of Cowdeforces ratings for each cow. The function then calculates the number of wins the cow of interest can achieve without swapping its rating with any other cow, and the number of wins it can achieve if it swaps its rating with the cow that has the highest rating among the cows with lower ratings. The function prints the maximum of these two values, which represents the maximum number of wins the cow of interest can achieve.**
