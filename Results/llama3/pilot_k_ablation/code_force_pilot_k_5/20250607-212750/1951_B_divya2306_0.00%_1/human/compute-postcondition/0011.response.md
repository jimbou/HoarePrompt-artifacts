The value of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. The stdin contains multiple test cases - 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `k` is an integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `wins` is 2, stdin contains multiple test cases - 1, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
