The code prints the value of `wins` minus 1, where `wins` is the number of elements in the list `a` that are less than or equal to the element at index `k - 1` in the list `a`. Since the current value of `wins` is greater than or equal to `k`, the value of `wins - 1` will be at least `k - 1`.

Output: **wins - 1 (where wins is the number of elements in the list a that are less than or equal to the element at index k - 1 in the list a)**
