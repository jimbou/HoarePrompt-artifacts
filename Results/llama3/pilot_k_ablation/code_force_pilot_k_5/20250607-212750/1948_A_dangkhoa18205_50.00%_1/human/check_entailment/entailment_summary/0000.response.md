Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a character is special if it is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads an integer n from standard input and prints 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to a certain letter determined by the value of n. This function seems to be correct as it meets the problem description.

`func_2` reads a positive integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then executes `func_1` that number of times. This function is also correct as it meets the problem description of executing the function for multiple test cases.

Since both functions together meet the problem description, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
