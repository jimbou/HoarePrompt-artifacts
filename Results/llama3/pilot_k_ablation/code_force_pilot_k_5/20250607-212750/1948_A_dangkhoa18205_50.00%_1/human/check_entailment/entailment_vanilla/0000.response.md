Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters. A special character is defined as a character that is equal to exactly one of its neighbors.

Function 1 (`func_1`) takes an integer `n` as input and checks if it is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the function prints 'NO' because it is not possible to create a string with exactly n special characters. If `n` is greater than 1, the function prints 'YES' and then constructs a string of uppercase Latin letters.

The string is constructed by iterating through the alphabet (represented by the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ') and adding characters to the result string (`res`). The function uses a while loop to add characters to the result string until `n` becomes 0.

Inside the loop, the function checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If it is, the function adds two occurrences of the current letter to the result string and subtracts 2 from `n`. If `n` is less than 2, the function adds only one occurrence of the current letter to the result string and subtracts 1 from `n`. The function also increments the index `i` to move to the next letter in the alphabet.

Function 2 (`func_2`) takes an integer `t` as input, which represents the number of test cases. The function then calls `func_1` `t` times to solve each test case.

The program is correct because it correctly implements the logic to construct a string with exactly n special characters. The use of the while loop and the conditional statements inside the loop ensure that the correct number of special characters is added to the result string. The program also handles the case where `n` is less than or equal to 1 correctly by printing 'NO'.

Correctness: **True**
