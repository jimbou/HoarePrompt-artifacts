Reasoning:

The problem requires building a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly n special characters, where a special character is equal to exactly one of its neighbors. The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.

`func_1` reads an integer n from standard input and prints 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 1. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' followed by a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to a certain letter determined by the value of n.

`func_2` reads a positive integer from standard input, representing the number of test cases, and then executes `func_1` that number of times.

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. `func_1` correctly handles the case where n is less than or equal to 1 and prints 'NO'. For n greater than 1, it prints 'YES' followed by a string that meets the condition of having exactly n special characters. `func_2` correctly executes `func_1` the specified number of times based on the input.

Correctness: **True**
