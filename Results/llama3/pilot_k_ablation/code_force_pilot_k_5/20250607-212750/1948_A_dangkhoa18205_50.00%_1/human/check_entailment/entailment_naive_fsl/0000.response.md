Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly handles the case when `n` is less than or equal to 1 by printing 'NO'. For `n` greater than 1, it prints 'YES' and constructs a string of uppercase Latin letters with exactly `n` special characters. The string is constructed by alternating between different letters and repeating each letter twice to create special characters. The program also handles the case when `n` is odd by adding a single letter at the end of the string.

The function `func_2` simply reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
