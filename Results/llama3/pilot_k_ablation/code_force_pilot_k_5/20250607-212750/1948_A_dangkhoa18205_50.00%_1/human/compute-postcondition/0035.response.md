Output State: **n is 0, 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is the integer division of the initial value of n by 2 plus the remainder of the division of the initial value of n by 2, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet if the initial value of n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), or a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet if the initial value of n is 1, or a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet if the initial value of n is less than or equal to 0.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed until n is 0, and the string res has been constructed by repeating each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet, where i is the integer division of the initial value of n by 2 plus the remainder of the division of the initial value of n by 2. If the initial value of n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), the string res consists of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet. If the initial value of n is 1, the string res consists of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet. If the initial value of n is less than or equal to 0, the string res consists of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet.
