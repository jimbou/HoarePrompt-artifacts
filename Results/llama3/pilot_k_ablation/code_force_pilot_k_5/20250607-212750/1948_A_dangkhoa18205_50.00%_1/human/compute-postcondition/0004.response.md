Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, and `func_1()` has been executed twice.**

The code snippet simply calls the function `func_1()` again. Since `func_1()` has already been executed once in the initial state, this call will be the second execution of `func_1()`. The value of `t` remains unchanged, still greater than 1.
