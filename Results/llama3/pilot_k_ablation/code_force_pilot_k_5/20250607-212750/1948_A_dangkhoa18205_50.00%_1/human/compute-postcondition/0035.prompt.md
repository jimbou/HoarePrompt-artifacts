Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: n is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), 'YES' is being printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 0, res is an empty string
Code of the loop:
while n > 0:
    if n >= 2:
        res += letter[i % 26] * 2
        n -= 2
    else:
        res += letter[i % 26]
        n -= 1
    i += 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is an integer, 'YES' has been printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA'). If `n` is less than or equal to -1, `res` is 'A'.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is an integer and greater than 0, 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB'). If `n` is 1, `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') if `n` is between 1 and 47 (inclusive), or 'A' if `n` is less than or equal to 0.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is an integer and greater than 1, 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('CC') if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is 1, `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or 'AA' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or 'A' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') if `n` is less than 2.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 4, n is an integer and greater than 1. If n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), res is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('CC') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') if n is greater than or equal to 2, or a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') if n is less than 2. If n is 1, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') if n is greater than or equal to 2, or 'AA' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') if n is less than 2. If n is less than or equal to 0, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') if n is greater than or equal to 2, or 'A' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') if n is less than 2. If n is greater than 1, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('CC') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') if n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), or a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') if n is greater than or equal to 2, or a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') if n is less than 2. If n is 1, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') if n is greater than or equal to 2, or 'AA' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') if n is less than 2. If n is less than or equal to 0, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') if n is greater than or equal to 2, or 'A' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') if n is less than 2.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is 5, n is an integer. If n is greater than or equal to 2, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('CC') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 5 of the alphabet ('FF') if n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), or a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('DD') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 5 of the alphabet ('FF') if n is greater than or equal to 2, or a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') plus the letter at index 3 of the alphabet ('D') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 5 of the alphabet ('FF') if n is less than 2.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
