According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is a positive integer, which ensures that the loop will execute. However, to make it more explicit, we can adjust the state of `t` to be greater than 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 0**
