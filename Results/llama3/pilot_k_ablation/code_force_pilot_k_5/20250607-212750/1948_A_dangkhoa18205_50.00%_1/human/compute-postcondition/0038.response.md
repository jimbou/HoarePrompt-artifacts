Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, which consists of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet, where `i` is the integer division of the initial value of `n` by 2 plus the remainder of the division of the initial value of `n` by 2.***
