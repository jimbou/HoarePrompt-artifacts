Output State: **`n` is an integer and greater than 1, 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 3. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('CC') if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is 1, `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB') if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or 'AA' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, or 'A' plus the letter at index 2 of the alphabet ('C') if `n` is less than 2.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 3. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
