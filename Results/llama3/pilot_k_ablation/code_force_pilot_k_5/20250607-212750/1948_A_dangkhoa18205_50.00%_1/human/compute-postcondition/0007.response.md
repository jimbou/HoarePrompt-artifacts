The only variable in the loop head is variable `t`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 3, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 2, and `func_1()` has been executed three times. So for the loop to execute one more time `t` must be greater than 3 and `func_1()` has been executed four times.
State: **`t` is greater than 3, and `func_1()` has been executed four times.**
