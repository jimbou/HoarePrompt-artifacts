You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Your Task:
Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer n (1 <= n <= 50).
    n = int(input())
    if (n <= 1) :
        print('NO')
        #This is printed: NO
    else :
        print('YES')
        #This is printed: YES
        letter = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
        i = 0
        res = ''
        while n > 0:
            if n >= 2:
                res += letter[i % 26] * 2
                n -= 2
            else:
                res += letter[i % 26]
                n -= 1
            
            i += 1
            
        #State: n is 0, 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is the integer division of the initial value of n by 2 plus the remainder of the division of the initial value of n by 2, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet if the initial value of n is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), or a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet if the initial value of n is 1, or a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet if the initial value of n is less than or equal to 0.
        print(res)
        #This is printed: ''
    #State: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains no input. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, 'NO' is printed. Otherwise, 'YES' is printed, and a string `res` is printed, which consists of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet, where `i` is the integer division of the initial value of `n` by 2 plus the remainder of the division of the initial value of `n` by 2.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: `n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), stdin contains no input, and the current value of `n` is less than or equal to 1, and 'NO' is being printed

Case_2: n is 0, 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', i is the integer division of the initial value of n by 2 plus the remainder of the division of the initial value of n by 2, res is a string consisting of two repetitions of each letter of the alphabet from 'A' to the letter at index (i-2) of the alphabet plus the letter at index (i-1) of the alphabet, and this is printed: ""


Now, please think step by step: 
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
