Output State: **`t` is greater than or equal to 0, and `func_1()` has been executed `t` times.**

In natural language, this means that after the loop has finished executing all its iterations, the value of `t` will be the same as it was initially (since the loop doesn't modify `t`), and the function `func_1()` will have been executed a number of times equal to the initial value of `t`.
