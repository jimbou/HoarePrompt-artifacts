Output State: **`n` is an integer and greater than 0, 'YES' has been printed, letter is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 2. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') plus two repetitions of the letter at index 1 of the alphabet ('BB'). If `n` is 1, `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA') if `n` is between 1 and 47 (inclusive), or 'A' if `n` is less than or equal to 0.**

The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so it becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
