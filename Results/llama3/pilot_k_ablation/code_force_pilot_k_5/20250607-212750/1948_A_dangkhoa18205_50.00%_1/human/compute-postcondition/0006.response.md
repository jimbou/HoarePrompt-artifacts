Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, and `func_1()` has been executed three times.**

The code executes the function `func_1()` once. Since `func_1()` has already been executed twice in the initial state, the total number of executions of `func_1()` is now three. The value of `t` remains greater than 2, as the code does not modify it.
