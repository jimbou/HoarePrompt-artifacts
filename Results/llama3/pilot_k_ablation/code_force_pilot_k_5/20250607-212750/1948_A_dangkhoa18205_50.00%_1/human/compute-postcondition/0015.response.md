The variable in the loop head is variable n, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable n.  If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an integer, So for the loop to be executed one more time n must be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is an integer and greater than 0, 'YES' has been printed, `letter` is 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', `i` is 1. If `n` is between 2 and 48 (inclusive), `res` is a string consisting of two repetitions of the first letter of the alphabet ('AA'). If `n` is less than or equal to -1, `res` is 'A'.**
