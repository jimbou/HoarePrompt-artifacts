The only variables in the loop head are variable  `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1 and `func_1()` has been executed twice. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 2 and `func_1()` has been executed twice.
State: **`t` is greater than 2, and `func_1()` has been executed twice.**
