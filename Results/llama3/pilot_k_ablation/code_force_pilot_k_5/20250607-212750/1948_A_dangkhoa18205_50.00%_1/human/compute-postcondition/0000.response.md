The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The stdin contains two inputs: first an integer (the number of test cases) and then a series of integers (the number of special characters in each test case). The first input is accepted and assigned to `t`, so stdin now contains one input: a series of integers (the number of special characters in each test case). The number of test cases is a positive integer, so `t` is a positive integer. The number of special characters in each test case is a positive integer, so the series of integers in stdin are positive integers.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, stdin contains one input: a series of positive integers**
