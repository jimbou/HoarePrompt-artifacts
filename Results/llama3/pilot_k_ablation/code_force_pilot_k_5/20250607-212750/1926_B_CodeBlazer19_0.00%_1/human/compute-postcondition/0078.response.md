Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is a string representing the next test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-6-1), `a` has the same value as before, which depends on the original value of `s`, and `b` is 'Square'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, the value of `n` is still between 2 and 10 and greater than 3, `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 1 and 4 respectively, the string `s` still represents the next test case, and the standard input contains the remaining test cases minus 6 minus 1. The value of `a` is unchanged and depends on the original value of `s`, and the value of `b` is now 'Square'.
