Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, and `b` is 'Square'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `a` depends on the initial value of `s`, but its value is not affected by the code. The value of `b` is updated to 'Square', regardless of its initial value.
