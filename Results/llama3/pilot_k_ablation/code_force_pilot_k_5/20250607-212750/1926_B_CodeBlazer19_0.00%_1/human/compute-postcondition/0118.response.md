The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `s` is a string representing the newly input value. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. However, if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is assigned the value 'Triangle' regardless of the value of `s`. If `s` does not contain exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' if `s` contains exactly one '1', and `b` is 'Square' if `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1'.**
