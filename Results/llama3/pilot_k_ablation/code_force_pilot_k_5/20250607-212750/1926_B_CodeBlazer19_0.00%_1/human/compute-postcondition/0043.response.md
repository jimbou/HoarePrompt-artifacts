Output: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains the remaining test cases - `n`. `a` is 0. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `b` is an empty string, and this is printed: the value of `b` which is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s`.
