The only variable in the loop head is variable  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `n` is between 3 and 10. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 3. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
