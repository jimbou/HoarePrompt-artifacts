To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `s` is a string representing the last test case, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `stdin` is empty**
