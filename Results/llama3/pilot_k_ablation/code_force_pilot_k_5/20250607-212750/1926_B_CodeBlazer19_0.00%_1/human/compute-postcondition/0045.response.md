Postcondition: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains the remaining test cases - `n`. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then 'Triangle' is printed. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then 'Square' is printed. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then nothing is printed.**
