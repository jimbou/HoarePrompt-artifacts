Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 3, n is an integer, i is 3, j is equal to n, s is a string representing the last test case, stdin is empty, a is 0, b is an empty string.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'Triangle'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'Square'


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `stdin` is empty. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is set to 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `s` is a string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. stdin contains no input.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is a new string that was just inputted from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
