Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 4. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

The code reads a new string from the input and assigns it to `s`. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin now contains the remaining test cases minus 4, since one test case has been read. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still valid based on the new value of `s`.
