The code prints the value of `b`, which is determined by the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1's, `b` is an empty string.
Output: **b (where b is an empty string if s contains exactly one '1', 'Square' if s contains more than one '1', and an empty string if s contains no '1's)**
