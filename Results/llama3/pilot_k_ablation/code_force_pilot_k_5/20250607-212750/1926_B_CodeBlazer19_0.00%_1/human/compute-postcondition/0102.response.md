Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the newly input value, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the previous value of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle'. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still dependent on the previous value of `s`, but it is no longer determined by the conditions specified in the initial state. The stdin still contains one input: a string.
