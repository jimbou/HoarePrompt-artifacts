Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1'.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    a = 0
    b = ''
    for j in range(n):
        s = input()
        if s.count('1') == 1:
            a = 'Triangle'
        elif s.count('1') > 1:
            b = 'Square'
    if a != 0:
        print(a)
    else:
        print(b)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains the remaining test cases - `n`. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then 'Triangle' is printed. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then 'Square' is printed. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then nothing is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is n, `s` is a string representing the last test case, stdin is empty. If at least one string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and the value of `a` is being printed. If no string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and either an empty string or 'Square' is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string representing the last test case, `stdin` is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, and 'Triangle' is printed. If `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', and 'Square' is printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` which is not 0 is being printed. If `s` contains more than one '1', then the value of `b` which is 'Square' is being printed. If `s` contains no '1', then the value of `b` which is an empty string is being printed. In all cases, stdin is empty.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string that has been newly inputted by the user, stdin is empty. If the new string `s` contains exactly one '1', then 'Triangle' is printed. If the new string `s` contains more than one '1', then 'Square' is printed. If the new string `s` contains no '1', then nothing is printed.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
