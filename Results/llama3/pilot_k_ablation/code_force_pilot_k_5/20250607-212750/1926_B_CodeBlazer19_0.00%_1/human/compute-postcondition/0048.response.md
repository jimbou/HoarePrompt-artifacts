The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is `n-1`, so it needs to be adjusted to `j` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, stdin contains the remaining test cases - n**
