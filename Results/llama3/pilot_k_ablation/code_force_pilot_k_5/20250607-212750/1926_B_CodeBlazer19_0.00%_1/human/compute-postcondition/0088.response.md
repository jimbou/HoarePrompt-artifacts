Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is n, `s` is a string representing the last test case, stdin is empty. If at least one string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and the value of `a` is being printed. If no string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and either an empty string or 'Square' is being printed.***
