Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, stdin contains the remaining test cases - `n`. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed `n` times, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 10. The variable `j` has reached its final value of `n-1`, and the remaining test cases in `stdin` have been reduced by `n`. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the last string `s` read from the input, which may contain exactly one '1', more than one '1', or no '1's.
