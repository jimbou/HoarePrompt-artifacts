Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string containing more than 1 occurrences of the character '1'. The string `s` contains more than 1 '1's. stdin contains the remaining test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The string `s` still contains more than one '1's, and the stdin still contains the remaining test cases minus one.
