Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string representing the last test case, `stdin` is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, and 'Triangle' is printed. If `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', and 'Square' is printed.***
