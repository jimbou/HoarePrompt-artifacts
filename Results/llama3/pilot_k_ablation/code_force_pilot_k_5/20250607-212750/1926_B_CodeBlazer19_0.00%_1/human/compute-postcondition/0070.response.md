Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is a string representing the fifth test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-5). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, and the number of test cases `n` is still between 2 and 10, and greater than 3. The values of `i` and `j` remain the same. The string `s` now represents the fifth test case, and the standard input `stdin` contains the remaining test cases minus one. The values of `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of '1's in the string `s`.
