Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is 3, `j` is 0, and `stdin` is empty. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is set to 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` remains an empty string.***
