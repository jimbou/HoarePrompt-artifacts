The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `n` becomes a new integer value between 2 and 10. The second line assigns the value of 0 to `a`. The third line assigns an empty string to `b`. The value of `t` is not affected by the code, so it remains an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1. The value of `i` is not affected by the code, so it remains 1. The value of `j` is not affected by the code, so it remains `n-1`. Stdin contains the remaining test cases - `n`, which is now `n-1` since one test case has been consumed by the input.

Output State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10, i is 1, j is n-1, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains the remaining test cases - n**
