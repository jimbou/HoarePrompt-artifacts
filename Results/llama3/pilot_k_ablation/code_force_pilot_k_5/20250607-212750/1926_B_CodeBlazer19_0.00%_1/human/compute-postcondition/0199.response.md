Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `s` is a string that has been inputted by the user, stdin contains no input, If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to a new string inputted by the user. The values of `t`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin is now empty as it has been used to input the new value of `s`. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of '1's in the string `s`.
