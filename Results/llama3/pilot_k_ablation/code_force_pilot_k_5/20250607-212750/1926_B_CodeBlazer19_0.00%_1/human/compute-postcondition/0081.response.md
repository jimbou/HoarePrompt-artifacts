Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is n, `s` is a string representing the last test case, stdin is empty. If any string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If no string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'.**

In natural language, after the loop executes all the iterations, the output state will have the following characteristics:

*   The number of test cases `t` remains greater than 1.
*   The value of `n` will be 0, indicating that all test cases have been processed.
*   The variable `i` remains unchanged at 1.
*   The variable `j` will be equal to the initial value of `n`, indicating that the loop has completed all iterations.
*   The variable `s` will hold the last test case processed.
*   The standard input `stdin` will be empty, as all test cases have been processed.
*   The variables `a` and `b` will be determined based on the presence of strings with exactly one '1' or more than one '1' in the test cases. If any test case contains exactly one '1', `a` will be 'Triangle', and `b` will be either an empty string or 'Square'. If no test case contains exactly one '1', `a` will be 0, and `b` will be either an empty string or 'Square'.
