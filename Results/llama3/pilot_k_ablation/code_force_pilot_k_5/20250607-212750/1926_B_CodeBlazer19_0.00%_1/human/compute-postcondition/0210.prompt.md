Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer greater than 4, i is 4, j is equal to n, s is a string that was just inputted from stdin, n is an integer, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'Triangle'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'Square'


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, stdin is empty. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string that has been inputted by the user. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3, `s` is a string that has been inputted by the user. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string that has been newly inputted by the user. If the new string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the new string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the new string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
