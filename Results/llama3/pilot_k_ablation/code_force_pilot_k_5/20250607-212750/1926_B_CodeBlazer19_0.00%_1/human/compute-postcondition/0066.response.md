Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string representing the fourth test case, `a` is either 0 or 'Triangle', `b` is 'Square', stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-4)**

In this output state, the value of `b` is updated to 'Square', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still dependent on the string `s`, but `b` is now always 'Square'.
