Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, `s` is a string representing the first test case that contains exactly one '1', stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-1)**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, the value of `n` is still between 2 and 10 and greater than 0, `i` is still 1, `j` is still 0, `a` is now assigned the string 'Triangle', `b` is still an empty string, `s` still represents the first test case with exactly one '1', and the standard input contains the remaining test cases, which is `n-1` cases.
