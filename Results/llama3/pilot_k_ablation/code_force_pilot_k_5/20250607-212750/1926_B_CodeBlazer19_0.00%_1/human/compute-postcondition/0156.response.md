Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin, stdin is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to the new string input from stdin. The conditions for `a` and `b` are also updated based on the new value of `s`. Since stdin is now empty, it is not included in the output state.
