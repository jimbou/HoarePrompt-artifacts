Output: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin. `a` is 0. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty, and the value of `b` is being printed which is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the number of '1's in the string `s`**
