To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of the variables in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

Since `n` is already given to be an integer between 2 and 10, we can conclude that `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied.

The variable `j` is not initialized before the loop, so we need to adjust its state. Since the loop iterates over the range of `n`, we can conclude that `j` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

The other variables `t`, `a`, `b`, and `i` are not in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases**
