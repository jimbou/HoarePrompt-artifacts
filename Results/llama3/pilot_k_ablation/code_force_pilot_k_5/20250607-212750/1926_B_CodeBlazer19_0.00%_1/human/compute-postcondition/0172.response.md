Based on the initial state, we can determine the value of `b` as follows:

* `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin, but stdin is empty. This means that `s` is an empty string.
* Since `s` is an empty string, it does not contain any '1's. Therefore, `b` is an empty string.

So, when the print statement `print(b)` is executed, it will print an empty string.

Output: **''**
