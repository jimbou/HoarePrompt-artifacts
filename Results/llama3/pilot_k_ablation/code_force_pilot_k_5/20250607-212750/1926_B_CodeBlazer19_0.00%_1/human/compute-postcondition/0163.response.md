Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is a new string that was just inputted from stdin, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `b` is 'Square' if `s` contains more than one '1', stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `a` is now 'Triangle', regardless of the initial conditions. The value of `b` depends on the number of '1's in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', `b` is an empty string. The stdin is empty.
