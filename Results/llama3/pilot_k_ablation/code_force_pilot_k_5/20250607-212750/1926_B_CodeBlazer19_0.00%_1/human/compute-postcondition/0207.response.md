Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string that has been newly inputted by the user. If the new string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If the new string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the new string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square', stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square' regardless of the number of '1's in the string `s`. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The conditions for `a` and `b` based on the number of '1's in `s` are still valid, but `b` is now always 'Square'.
