Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the third test case, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-3).**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still dependent on the number of '1's in the string `s`, but since `a` is now 'Triangle', it is likely that `s` contains exactly one '1', in which case `b` would be an empty string. However, it is also possible that `s` contains more than one '1', in which case `b` would be 'Square'. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases - (n-3).
