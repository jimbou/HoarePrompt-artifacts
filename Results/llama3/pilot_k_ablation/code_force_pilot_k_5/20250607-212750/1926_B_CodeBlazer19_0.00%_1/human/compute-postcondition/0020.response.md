Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', stdin contains the remaining test cases - 3.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle'. The values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` is still dependent on the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`, but `a` is now fixed to 'Triangle'.
