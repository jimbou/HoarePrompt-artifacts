Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 3, `i` is 3, `j` is 3, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square'.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is also unchanged, but its contents determine the values of `a` and `b`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.
