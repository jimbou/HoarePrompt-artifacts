Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `s` is a string representing the newly input value. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square', stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 2, `n` is still greater than 3, `i` is still 2, and `j` is still 3. The string `s` still represents the newly input value. However, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', regardless of the number of '1's in `s`. The value of `a` remains dependent on the number of '1's in `s`, but `b` is now always 'Square'. There is no input left in stdin.
