Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is a string representing the fifth test case, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' if the string `s` contains exactly one '1', or `b` is 'Square' if the string `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-5)**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle'. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still dependent on the contents of the string `s`, but since `s` has not been modified, the conditions for `b` remain the same. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, which is (n-5).
