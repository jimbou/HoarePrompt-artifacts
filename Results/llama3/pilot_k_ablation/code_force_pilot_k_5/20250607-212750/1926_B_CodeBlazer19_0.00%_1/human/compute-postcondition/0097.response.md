Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `stdin` is empty. The string `s` contains more than one '1'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 2, `n` is still greater than 0, `i` remains 2, `j` remains 0, `a` remains 0, and `b` is now assigned the string 'Square'. The input buffer `stdin` is still empty. The string `s` still contains more than one '1'.
