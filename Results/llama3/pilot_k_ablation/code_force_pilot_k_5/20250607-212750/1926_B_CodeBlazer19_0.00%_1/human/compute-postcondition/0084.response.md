Output: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be equal to 0, `i` is 1, `j` is n, `s` is a string representing the last test case, stdin is empty. The current value of `a` is not 0, which means that at least one string `s` contains exactly one '1', and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and the value of `a` is being printed**
