Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 0, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin and contains more than 1 occurrences of the character '1', `n` is greater than 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The string `s` still contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', and `n` is still greater than 0. The stdin remains empty.
