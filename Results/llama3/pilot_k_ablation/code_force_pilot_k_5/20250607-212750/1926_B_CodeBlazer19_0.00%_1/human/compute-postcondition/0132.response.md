The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `t` is greater than 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 and `t` must be greater than 3.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 3, `n` is equal to `t`, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string representing the last test case, `stdin` is empty. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, and 'Triangle' is printed. If `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', and 'Square' is printed.**
