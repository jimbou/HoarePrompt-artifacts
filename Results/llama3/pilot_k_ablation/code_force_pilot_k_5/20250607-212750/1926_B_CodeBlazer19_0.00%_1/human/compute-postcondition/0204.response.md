The only variable in the loop head is `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string that has been inputted by the user. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
