Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `s` is a string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. stdin contains no input.***
