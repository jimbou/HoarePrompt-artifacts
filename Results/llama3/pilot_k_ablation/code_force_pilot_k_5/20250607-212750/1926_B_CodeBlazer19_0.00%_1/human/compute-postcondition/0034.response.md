Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 5. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.***
