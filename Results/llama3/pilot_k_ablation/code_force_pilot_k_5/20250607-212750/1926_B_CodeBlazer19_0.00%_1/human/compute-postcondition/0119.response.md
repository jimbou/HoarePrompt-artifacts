Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `s` is a newly input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 2, `n` is still greater than 4, `i` is still 2, and `j` is still 4. The value of `s` has been updated to a newly input string. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the number of '1's in the newly input string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. There is no input left in the standard input stdin.
