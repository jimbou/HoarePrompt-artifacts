Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string representing the newly input value. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.***
