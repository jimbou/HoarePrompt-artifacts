Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 5. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to a new string from the input, and the stdin now contains the remaining test cases minus 5. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`.
