Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 3. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

The code `s = input()` reads a string from the input and assigns it to the variable `s`. The previous value of `s` is replaced by the new input string. The other variables `t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code. The stdin now contains one less test case. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still valid based on the new value of `s`.
