To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `n`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains the same, but since `j` is now 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `t`, `i`, `s`, `a`, and `b` are not part of the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string representing the third test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-3). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'.**
