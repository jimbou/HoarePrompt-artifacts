Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than or equal to 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is equal to `t`, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string representing the last test case, stdin is empty. If at least one string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and the value of `a` is being printed. If no string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and either an empty string or 'Square' is being printed.**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the number of test cases `t` is greater than or equal to 0, and the loop has processed all the test cases. The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10, and the loop has finished processing the last test case. The string `s` represents the last test case, and the standard input `stdin` is empty because all the test cases have been processed. If at least one test case contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` is 'Triangle' and the value of `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and the value of `a` is being printed. If no test case contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` is 0 and the value of `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', and either an empty string or 'Square' is being printed.
