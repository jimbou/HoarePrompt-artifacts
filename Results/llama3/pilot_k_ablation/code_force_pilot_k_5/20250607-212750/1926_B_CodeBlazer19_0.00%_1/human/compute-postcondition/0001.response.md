According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1'. So for the loop to be executed `t` must be greater than 0 and i is now 0.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1', i is 0**
