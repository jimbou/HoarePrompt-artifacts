Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string with exactly one occurrence of the character '1', and stdin contains the remaining test cases - 1.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0, `n` is still between 2 and 10, `b` is still an empty string, `i` and `j` are still 0, and `s` still contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1'. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases - 1.
