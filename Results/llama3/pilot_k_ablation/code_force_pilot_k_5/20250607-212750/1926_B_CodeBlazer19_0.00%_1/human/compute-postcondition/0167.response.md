Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all its iterations is as follows:

The loop will execute until `j` is equal to `n`. At this point, `j` will have taken on the value of `n`, and `s` will be the last string inputted from stdin. The values of `a` and `b` will depend on the contents of `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` will be 'Triangle' and `b` will be an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` will be 0 and `b` will be 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` will be 0 and `b` will be an empty string. The stdin will be empty at this point.
