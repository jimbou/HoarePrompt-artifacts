Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is a string from the input, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', stdin contains the remaining test cases - 5.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', regardless of the previous value of `b`. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `a` is still dependent on the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0.
