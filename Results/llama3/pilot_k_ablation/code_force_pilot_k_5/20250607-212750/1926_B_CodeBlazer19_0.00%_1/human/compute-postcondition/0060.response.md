Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the third test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-3). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, and the number of test cases in the current test case `n` is still between 2 and 10 and greater than 1. The values of `i` and `j` are still 1. The string `s` still represents the third test case. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases minus 3. The value of `b` is now always 'Square', regardless of the number of '1's in the string `s`. The value of `a` depends on the number of '1's in the string `s`: if there is exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle'; if there are more than one '1's or no '1's, then `a` is 0.
