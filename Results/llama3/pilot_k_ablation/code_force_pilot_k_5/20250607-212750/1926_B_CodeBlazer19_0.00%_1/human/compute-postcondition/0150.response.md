Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 2, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin, stdin contains no input. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to the string that was just inputted from stdin. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of '1's in `s`, but now `s` has a new value. Stdin is empty since it was used to input the new value of `s`.
