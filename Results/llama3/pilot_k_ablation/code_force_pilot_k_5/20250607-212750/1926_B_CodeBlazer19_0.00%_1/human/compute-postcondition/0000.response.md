The code `t = int(input())` accepts an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that stdin contains multiple test cases, the first input is an integer representing the number of test cases. This integer is assigned to `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, stdin contains the remaining test cases, each containing an integer n (2 <= n <= 10) followed by n lines each containing n characters '0' or '1'.**
