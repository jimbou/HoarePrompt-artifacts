State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `n`, `s` is a string that was just inputted from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then the value of `a` which is not 0 is being printed. If `s` contains more than one '1', then the value of `b` which is 'Square' is being printed. If `s` contains no '1', then the value of `b` which is an empty string is being printed. In all cases, stdin is empty.**
