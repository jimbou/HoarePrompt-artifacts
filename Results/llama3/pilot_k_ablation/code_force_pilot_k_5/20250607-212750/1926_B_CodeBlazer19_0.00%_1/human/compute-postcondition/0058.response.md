Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the third test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-3). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the third test case, and the stdin now contains the remaining test cases minus one. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of '1's in the string `s`.
