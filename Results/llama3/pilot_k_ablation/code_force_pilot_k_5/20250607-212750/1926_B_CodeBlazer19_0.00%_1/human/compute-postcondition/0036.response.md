Output State: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases - `n`. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the loop counter `j` will be equal to `n-1`, indicating that the loop has completed all `n` iterations. The input string `s` will be the last string read from the input. The values of `a` and `b` will depend on the last string `s` read from the input, following the same rules as before. The other variables `t` and `i` remain unchanged.
