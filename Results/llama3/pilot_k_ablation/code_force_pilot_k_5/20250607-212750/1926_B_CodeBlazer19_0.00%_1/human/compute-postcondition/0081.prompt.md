Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, n is an integer between 2 and 10, i is 1, j is n-1, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin contains the remaining test cases - n
Code of the loop:
for j in range(n):
    s = input()
    if s.count('1') == 1:
        a = 'Triangle'
    elif s.count('1') > 1:
        b = 'Square'


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `s` is a string representing the first test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-1). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the third test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-3). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string representing the fourth test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-4). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is a string representing the fifth test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-5). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is a string representing the next test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-6-1). If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` retains its original value. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` retains its original value and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1's, `a` retains its original value and `b` retains its original value.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
