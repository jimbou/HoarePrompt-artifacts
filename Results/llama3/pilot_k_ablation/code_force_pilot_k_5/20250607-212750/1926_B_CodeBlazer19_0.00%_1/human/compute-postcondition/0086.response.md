Based on the precondition, we can determine the output of the print statement.

The variable `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. Since `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be equal to 0, and `i` is 1, `j` is `n`, which means `j` is also 0. 

However, the value of `b` is not directly dependent on `n`, `i`, or `j`. Instead, it is dependent on some condition that is not explicitly stated in the precondition. 

Given the information provided, we can't determine the exact value of `b`. However, we can describe its possible values.

Output: **either an empty string or 'Square'**
