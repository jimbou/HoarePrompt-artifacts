Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the newly input value, `stdin` contains one input: a string. If `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**

In this output state, the value of `s` has been updated to the newly input string, and the stdin now contains one input: a string. The values of the other variables remain the same. The conditions for `a` and `b` are still dependent on the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`.
