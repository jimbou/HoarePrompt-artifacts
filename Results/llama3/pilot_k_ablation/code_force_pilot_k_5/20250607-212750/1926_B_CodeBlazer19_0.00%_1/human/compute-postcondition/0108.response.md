Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `s` is a string representing the newly input value, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the value of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', regardless of the previous value of `s`. The value of `b` remains the same, either an empty string or 'Square', depending on the original value of `s`. The other variables, `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j`, remain unchanged. The stdin still contains one input: a string.
