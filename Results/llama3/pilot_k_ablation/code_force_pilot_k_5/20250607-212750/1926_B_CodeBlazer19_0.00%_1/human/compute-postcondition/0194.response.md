Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string that has been inputted by the user, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is an empty string if the string `s` contains no '1' or exactly one '1', otherwise `b` is 'Square'**.

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle'. The values of `t`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` depends on the content of the string `s`. If `s` contains no '1' or exactly one '1', then `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `b` is 'Square'.
