State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, stdin is empty. If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
