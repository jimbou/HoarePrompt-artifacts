Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `a` is 0, `b` is an empty string, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `s` is a string, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 1**

In this output state, the variable `s` has been assigned the value of the input string from the standard input, which is now reduced by one test case. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.
