Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', stdin contains the remaining test cases - 2. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `b` is an empty string.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0, the value of `n` is still between 2 and 10, `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 0 and 1 respectively, the string `s` is still the same, and `a` is now set to 'Triangle'. The value of `b` depends on the occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', `b` is an empty string. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases minus 2.
