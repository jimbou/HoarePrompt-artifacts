Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `s` is a string representing the fifth test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-5). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square' regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the string `s` and the values of `a` and `b` are still valid, but with the specific value of `b` being 'Square'.
