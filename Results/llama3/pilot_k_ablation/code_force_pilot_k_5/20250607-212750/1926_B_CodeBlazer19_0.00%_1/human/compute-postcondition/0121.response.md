Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 2, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `s` is a newly input string. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. stdin contains no input.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 2, `n` is still greater than 4, `i` and `j` remain unchanged at 2 and 4 respectively. The string `s` is still a newly input string. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the number of '1's in `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. There is no input left in stdin.
