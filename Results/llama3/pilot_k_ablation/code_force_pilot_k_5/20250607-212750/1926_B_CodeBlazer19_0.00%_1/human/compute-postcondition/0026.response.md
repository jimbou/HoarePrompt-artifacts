Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 4 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `s` is a string from the input, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either 'Square' or an empty string depending on the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 4.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle'. The values of `t`, `n`, `i`, `j`, and `s` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `b` is still dependent on the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, but `a` is now fixed as 'Triangle'. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases - 4.
