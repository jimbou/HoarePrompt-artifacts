Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer, `s` is a string that has been newly inputted by the user, stdin is empty. The current value of `a` is not 0. The current value of `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string because the new string `s` contains exactly one '1'.***
