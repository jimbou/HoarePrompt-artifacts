Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 5 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `s` is a string from the input, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' depending on the occurrences of '1' in `s`, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 5.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle' as specified in the code. The other variables remain unchanged. The value of `b` is still dependent on the occurrences of '1' in the string `s`, but `a` is now fixed as 'Triangle'.
