Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 3 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `s` is a string from the input, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 3. If the string `s` contains exactly one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 0, the value of `n` is still between 3 and 10, `i` is still 0, and `j` is still 2. The string `s` is still the same string from the input. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases minus 3. However, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', regardless of the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. The value of `a` depends on the number of occurrences of '1' in `s`, but `b` is now always 'Square'.
