Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 3, `j` is 4, `s` is a new string that was just inputted from stdin. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to a new string that was just inputted from stdin. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the new value of `s`, following the same conditions as before. Since `s` is now a new string, the stdin is empty.
