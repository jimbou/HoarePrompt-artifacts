Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `s` is a string representing the fourth test case, `a` is 'Triangle', `b` is either an empty string or 'Square' if `s` contains exactly one '1', otherwise `b` is either an empty string or 'Square', stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-4).**

In natural language, the output state is: The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, the value of `n` is still between 2 and 10 and greater than 2, `i` is still 1, `j` is still 2, `s` still represents the fourth test case. The value of `a` is now 'Triangle'. The value of `b` depends on the number of '1's in `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. If `s` contains more than one '1' or no '1', then `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'. The remaining test cases are still in stdin.
