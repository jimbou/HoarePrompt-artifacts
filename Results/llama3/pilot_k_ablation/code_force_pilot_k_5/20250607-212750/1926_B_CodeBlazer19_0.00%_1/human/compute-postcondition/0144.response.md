Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 3, `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `s` is a string, if `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string, if `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square', if `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string, and stdin contains no input.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to the input string. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the number of occurrences of the character '1' in the string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. The stdin is empty as it has been used to input the string `s`.
