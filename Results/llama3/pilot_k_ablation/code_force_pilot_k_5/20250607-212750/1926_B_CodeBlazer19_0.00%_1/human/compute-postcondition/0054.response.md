Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `a` is 0, `b` is 'Square', `s` is a string representing the first test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-1). The string `s` contains more than one '1'.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', while the values of the other variables remain the same as in the initial state. The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, `n` is still an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is still 1, `j` is still 0, `a` is still 0, and `s` is still a string representing the first test case with more than one '1'. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, which is (n-1).
