Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square', stdin contains the remaining test cases - 2.**

In this output state, the value of `b` has been updated to 'Square', regardless of the previous conditions. The other variables remain unchanged, and their previous conditions still apply. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases - 2.
