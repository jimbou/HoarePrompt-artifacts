Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 4, `n` is greater than 4, `s` is a string that has been newly inputted by the user. If the new string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the new string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the new string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `j`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `s` is updated to a new string input by the user. The values of `a` and `b` are determined based on the new string `s`. If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1', `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string. The stdin is empty after the input operation.
