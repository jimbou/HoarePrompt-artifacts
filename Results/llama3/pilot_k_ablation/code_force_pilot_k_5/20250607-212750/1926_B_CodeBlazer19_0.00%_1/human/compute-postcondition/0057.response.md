The only variable in the loop head is variable `j` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the second test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-2). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is an empty string. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is an empty string.**
