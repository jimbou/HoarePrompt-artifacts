Output State: **t is an integer greater than 4, i is 4, j is equal to n, s is a string that was just inputted from stdin, n is an integer, a is 0, b is an empty string, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `t` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. The value of `i` also remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `j` is equal to `n`, which is now an integer assigned from the input. The value of `s` remains the same as it was just inputted from stdin. The value of `n` is now an integer assigned from the input. The value of `a` is 0, and the value of `b` is an empty string. Stdin is empty as all inputs have been consumed.
