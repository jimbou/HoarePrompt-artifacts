Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `s` is a string representing the third test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-3). If the string `s` contains exactly one '1', then `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains more than one '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. If the string `s` contains no '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'.***
