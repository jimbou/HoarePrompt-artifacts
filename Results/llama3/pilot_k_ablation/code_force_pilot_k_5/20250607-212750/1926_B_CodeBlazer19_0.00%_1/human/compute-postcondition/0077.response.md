Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is a string representing the next test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-6-1), `a` is 'Triangle', `b` has the same value as before, which depends on the original value of `s`.**

In this output state, the value of `a` has been updated to 'Triangle', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged. The number of test cases `t` is still greater than 1, `n` is still between 2 and 10 and greater than 3, `i` is still 1, `j` is still 4, and `s` still represents the next test case. The stdin still contains the remaining test cases, and `b` retains its original value, which depends on the original value of `s`.
