Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `s` is a string, stdin contains the remaining test cases - 2. If the string `s` contains more than one occurrence of the character '1', then `a` is 0 and `b` is 'Square'. Otherwise, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0 and `b` is either an empty string or 'Square'.***
