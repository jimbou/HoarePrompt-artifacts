Output State: **`t` is an integer greater than 4, `i` is 4, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, `s` is a string that has been inputted by the user, `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, `b` is 'Square'**.

In this output state, the values of `t`, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `s` remain unchanged. The value of `a` is either 'Triangle' or 0, depending on the initial condition. The value of `b` is updated to 'Square', regardless of its initial value.
