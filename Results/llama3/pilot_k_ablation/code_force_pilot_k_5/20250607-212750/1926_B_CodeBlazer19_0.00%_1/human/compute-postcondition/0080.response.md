Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 1, `n` is an integer between 2 and 10 that must be greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `s` is a string representing the next test case, stdin contains the remaining test cases - (n-6-1). If `s` contains exactly one '1', `a` is 'Triangle' and `b` retains its original value. If `s` contains more than one '1', `a` retains its original value and `b` is 'Square'. If `s` contains no '1's, `a` retains its original value and `b` retains its original value.***
