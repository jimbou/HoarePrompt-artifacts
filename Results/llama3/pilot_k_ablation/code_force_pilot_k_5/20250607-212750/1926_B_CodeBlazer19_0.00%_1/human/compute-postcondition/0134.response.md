The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, j is equal to n, so for the loop to execute, j must be 0 and n must be greater than 0.

State: **t is an integer representing the number of test cases that must be greater than 3, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, i is 3, j is 0, s is a string representing the last test case, stdin is empty, a is 0, b is an empty string**
