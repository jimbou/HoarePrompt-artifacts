This function reads multiple test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer n followed by n lines of n characters ('0' or '1'). It determines whether the grid of characters contains a triangle or a square that encompasses all the '1's and prints the corresponding shape ('Triangle' or 'Square'). If no shape is found, it prints an empty string. The function processes all test cases and prints the result for each case.
