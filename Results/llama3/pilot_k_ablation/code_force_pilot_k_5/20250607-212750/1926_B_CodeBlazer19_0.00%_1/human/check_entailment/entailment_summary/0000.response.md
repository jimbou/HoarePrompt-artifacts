Reasoning:
The given program is incorrect. The program checks if a row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it sets the shape to 'Triangle'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row. The program also checks if a row contains more than one '1' and if so, it sets the shape to 'Square'. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square can have multiple '1's in a row, but the number of '1's must be the same in each row.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to determine if the shape is a triangle or a square based on the problem description. It does not check the number of '1's in each row, nor does it check if the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid.

Correctness: **False**
