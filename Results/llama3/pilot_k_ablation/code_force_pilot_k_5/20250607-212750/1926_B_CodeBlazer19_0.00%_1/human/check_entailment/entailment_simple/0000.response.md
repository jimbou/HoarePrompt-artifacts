Reasoning: 

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it prints "Triangle". However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in a row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

Moreover, the program checks if any row contains more than one '1' and if so, it prints "Square". However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square can have multiple '1's in a row, but the number of '1's must be the same in each row.

The program also does not check if the shape is an upside-down triangle, which is also considered a valid triangle.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**
