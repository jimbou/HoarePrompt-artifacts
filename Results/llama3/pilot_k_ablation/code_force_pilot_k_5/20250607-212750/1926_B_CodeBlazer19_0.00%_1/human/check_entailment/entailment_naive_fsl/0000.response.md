Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly identify the shape in the grid. The issue lies in the fact that it only checks if a row has exactly one '1' to determine if it's a triangle, and if a row has more than one '1' to determine if it's a square. However, this approach is not sufficient to correctly identify the shapes.

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
001
010
100
```

This is a triangle, but the program will incorrectly identify it as a square because it only checks the number of '1's in each row, not their positions.

A correct solution would need to check the positions of the '1's in each row to determine the shape. For example, it could check if the '1's in each row are consecutive and if they form a triangle or square shape.
