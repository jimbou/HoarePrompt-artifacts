Reasoning:

The given program is incorrect. The program checks if any row contains exactly one '1' and if so, it prints "Triangle". However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a triangle. A triangle can have multiple '1's in each row, as long as the number of '1's increases by 2 in each subsequent row.

Moreover, the program checks if any row contains more than one '1' and if so, it prints "Square". However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine if the shape is a square. A square can have multiple '1's in each row, but the number of '1's must be the same in each row.

The program does not correctly check the shape of the grid. It does not verify if the number of '1's in each row increases by 2 for a triangle or remains the same for a square. It also does not check if the '1's are positioned at an equal distance from the left edge of the grid for a square.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
