The function reads a series of test cases from standard input, where each test case consists of an integer length and a string of characters representing cells. It then iterates through each string, counting the number of cells with coins ('@') and keeping track of the number of consecutive cells with thorns ('*'). If two consecutive cells with thorns are encountered, the function stops counting coins for that test case. Finally, the function prints the total number of coins counted for each test case.
