Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least len characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, and stdin contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 1 if the first character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues with its normal execution. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 2 if the second character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@' and 0 if `i` is not '@'. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 3 if the third character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 2 if `i` is '@' and 1 if `i` is not '@'. `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is either 0 or 1. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases. If `thorn` is 3, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `thorn` is 2 and `i` is not '*' and not '@', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters. If the fourth character `i` in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 4. Otherwise, `ret` is 3 if `i` is '@' and 2 if `i` is not '@'. `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if `thorn` is 3, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in the list. If `i` is '@', `ret` is either 3, 4, or 5, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains either t-1, t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases. If `i` is '*', `ret` is either 2, 3, or 4, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and stdin contains either t-2, t-3, t-4, or t-5 test cases. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with its execution. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is either 2, 3, or 4, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains either t-1, t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
