Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 1 if the second character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is either 1 or 2 if the second character `i` in the list `s` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases.***
