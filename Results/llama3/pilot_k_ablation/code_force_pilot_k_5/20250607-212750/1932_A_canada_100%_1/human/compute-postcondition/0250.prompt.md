Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t test cases. Each test case contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 50) followed by a string of n characters, where '.' denotes an empty cell, '@' denotes a cell with a coin, and '*' denotes a cell with thorns. The first cell is always empty.
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(int(input())):
    len = int(input())
    s = list(input())
    ret = 0
    thorn = 0
    for i in s:
        if i == '@':
            thorn = 0
            ret += 1
        elif i == '*':
            thorn += 1
            if thorn == 2:
                break
        else:
            thorn = 0
    print(ret)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters, `ret` is an integer between 0 and `len`, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and the value of `ret` which is an integer between 0 and `len` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is an empty list, ret is the number of '@' characters in the original list s, thorn is 0 if the last character in the list is not '*', otherwise thorn is 1 if the last character is '*', stdin contains t-3 test cases if the loop did not break, otherwise stdin contains t-4 test cases, and the number of '@' characters in the original list s which is 0 is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is an integer between 0 and `len`, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, and `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4, or t-5 test cases, and the value of `ret` which is an integer between 0 and `len` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is the number of '@' characters in the list `s`, `thorn` is either 0 or 1 if the last character in the list `s` is not '*', and `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases. If the last character in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of '@' characters in the list `s` which is equal to [ret] is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is an integer between 0 and `len`, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains at least 0 test cases, and the value of `ret` which is an integer between 0 and `len` is being printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
