Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0, `i` is the second character in the list. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character is not '*', `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the first character is '*' and `thorn` is 3, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. Otherwise, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.***
