Output State: **len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of len+1 characters, i is the len+1 character in the list, ret is increased by 1, thorn is 0**

In this output state, the value of `len` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `s` also remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `ret` is increased by 1, so its new value is the original value plus 1. The value of `thorn` is set to 0 by the first line of the code, so its final value is 0.
