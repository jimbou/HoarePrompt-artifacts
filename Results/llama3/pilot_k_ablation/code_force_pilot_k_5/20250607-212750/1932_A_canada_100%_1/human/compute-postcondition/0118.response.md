Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `stdin` contains either t-3 or t-4 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables retain their initial values, but the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement it was directly inside. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same, either t-3 or t-4.
