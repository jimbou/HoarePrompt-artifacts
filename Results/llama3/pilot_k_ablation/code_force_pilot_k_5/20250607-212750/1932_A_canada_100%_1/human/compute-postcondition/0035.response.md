Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character in `s`, the values of `ret` depends on the value of `i`, and `thorn` is increased by 1, and stdin contains `t-1` test cases. If `thorn` is equal to 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases.**
