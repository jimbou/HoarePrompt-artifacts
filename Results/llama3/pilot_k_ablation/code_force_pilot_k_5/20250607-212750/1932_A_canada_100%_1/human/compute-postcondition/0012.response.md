The code `thorn = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `thorn`. The previous value of `thorn` was 0, so this assignment does not change its value. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, `i` is the first character in the list, and `i` is not equal to '@' and `i` is not equal to '*'.**
