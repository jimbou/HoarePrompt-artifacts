Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases. If the fifth character `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged, and the conditions related to the fifth character `i` and the values of `ret` and `thorn` are still applicable.
