Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 1. If `thorn` is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases.***
