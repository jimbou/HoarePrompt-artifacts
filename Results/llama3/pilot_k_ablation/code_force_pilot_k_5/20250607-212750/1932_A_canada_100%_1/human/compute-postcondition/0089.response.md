The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `s`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `s`. If the list has at least `len+1` characters the loop executes again for the `len+1` time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least `len` characters, `i` is the `len` character in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least `len+1` characters and the `i` is the `len+1` character in the list.
State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len+1` characters that must have at least len+1 characters, `i` is the len+1 character in the list, `ret` is increased by 1, `thorn` is 0**
