Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len-1` characters that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is 0.***
