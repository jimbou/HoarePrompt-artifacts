Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1 from its original value, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases. However, `thorn` is now 0 regardless of its previous value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length of the string `s` is still between 1 and 1000, and `s` still has at least 5 characters. The fifth character `i` is still the same. The value of `ret` is still increased by 1 if `i` is '@'. However, the value of `thorn` is now reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The number of test cases in stdin is still either `t-1` or `t-2`, depending on the previous value of `thorn` and the character `i`.
