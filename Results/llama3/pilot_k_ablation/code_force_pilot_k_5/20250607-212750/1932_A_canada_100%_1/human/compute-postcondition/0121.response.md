Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `i` is the second character in the list `s`, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, and `stdin` contains either t-3 or t-4 test cases. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
