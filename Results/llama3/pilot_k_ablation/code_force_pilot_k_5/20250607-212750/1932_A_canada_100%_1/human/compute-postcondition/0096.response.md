Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len+1` characters that must have at least len+1 characters, `i` is the len+1 character in the list, `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `thorn` remains 1. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
