Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If `thorn` is 4, then `thorn` is 2. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.***
