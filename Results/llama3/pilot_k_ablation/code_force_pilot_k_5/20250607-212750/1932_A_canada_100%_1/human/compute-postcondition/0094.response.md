Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len+1` characters that must have at least len+1 characters, `i` is the len+1 character in the list, `ret` is increased by 1, `thorn` is 0**

The code simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `thorn`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. The list `s` still has at least `len+1` characters, and `i` is still the `len+1` character in the list. The value of `ret` is still increased by 1.
