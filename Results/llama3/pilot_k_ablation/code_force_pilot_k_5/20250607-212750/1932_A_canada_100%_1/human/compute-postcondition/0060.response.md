Postcondition: **len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of len characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 0, the first character in the list, i, is equal to '*', and i is not equal to '@'. If thorn is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, stdin contains t-3 test cases.**
