Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least len characters, `i` is the len character in the list, `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
