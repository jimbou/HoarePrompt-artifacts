Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 1 and `ret` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 2. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If `thorn` is 4, then `thorn` is 2. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `len`, `s`, `i`, `thorn`, and `ret` remain the same, and the stdin still contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.
