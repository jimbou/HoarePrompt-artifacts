The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` has at least 4 characters the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 characters and the `i` is the fourth character in the list.
State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, or 3, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the fourth character in the list**
