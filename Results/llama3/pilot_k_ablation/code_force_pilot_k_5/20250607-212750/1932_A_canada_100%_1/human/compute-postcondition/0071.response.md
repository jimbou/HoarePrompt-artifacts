Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 1 if the first character in the list is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. If the second character `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the first character is not '*', `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the first character is '*' and `thorn` is not 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases if the first character is not '*', otherwise if the first character is '*' and `thorn` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.***
