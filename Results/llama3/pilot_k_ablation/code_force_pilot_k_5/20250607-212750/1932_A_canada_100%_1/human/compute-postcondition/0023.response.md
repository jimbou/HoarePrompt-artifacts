To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `s`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `s` has at least one more character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, and `i` is the second character in the list.

For the loop to execute again, `s` must have at least 3 characters, and `i` must be the third character in the list.

State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases, and `i` is the third character in the list.**
