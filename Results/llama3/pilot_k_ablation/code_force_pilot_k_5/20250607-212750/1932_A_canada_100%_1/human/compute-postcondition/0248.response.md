The code prints the value of `ret`, which is an integer between 0 and `len`. Since the exact value of `ret` is not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ret`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `ret`.

Output: **ret (where ret is an integer between 0 and len)**
