Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character and the first character is '*', `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, `stdin` contains t-4 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain unchanged. The stdin now contains t-4 test cases because we have already processed 1 test case. We also break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.
