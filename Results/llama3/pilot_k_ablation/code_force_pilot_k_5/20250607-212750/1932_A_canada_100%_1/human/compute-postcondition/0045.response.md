Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1 from its original value, and `thorn` is 1, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 2. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is 1, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '@' or '*', `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases.***
