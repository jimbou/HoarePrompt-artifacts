Output State: **len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters, ret is either 2, 3, or 4, thorn is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test cases, i is the fourth character in the list**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` is reset to 0, and the value of `ret` is incremented by 1, resulting in a new value that is either 2, 3, or 4. The values of `len`, `s`, `stdin`, and `i` remain unchanged.
