Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1 from its original value, and `thorn` is 1, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 2, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is 1, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of `len`, `s`, `i`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain the same as in the initial state. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, regardless of the value of `i`. The number of test cases in stdin is either `t-2` or `t-1`, `t-2` depending on the original value of `thorn`.
