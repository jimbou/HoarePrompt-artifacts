Postcondition: **len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of len characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases, i is the first character in the list, and i is not equal to '@'. If i is '*', then if thorn is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, stdin contains t-3 test cases. If i is not '*', then i is not equal to '*' and the program continues with the else part.**
