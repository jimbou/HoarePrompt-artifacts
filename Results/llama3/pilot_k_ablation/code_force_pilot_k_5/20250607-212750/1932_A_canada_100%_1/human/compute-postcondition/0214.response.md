Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2, stdin contains at least 0 test cases. If the first character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the first character `i` is '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is either 1 or 2. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0.***
