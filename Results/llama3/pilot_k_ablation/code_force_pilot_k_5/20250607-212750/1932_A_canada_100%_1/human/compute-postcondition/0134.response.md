Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 2 or 3 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is not 3. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 4, or 5. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `len`, `s`, and `i` remain the same as in the initial state. The value of `ret` and `thorn` depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 2 or 3 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is not 3. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 4, or 5. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
