Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0. If the first character `i` in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and `stdin` contains either t-3 or t-4 test cases depending on the value of `thorn`. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character `i` in the list `s` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0, and `stdin` contains t-3 test cases.***
