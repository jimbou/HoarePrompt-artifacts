Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, or 3, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases. If the fourth character `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*', the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
