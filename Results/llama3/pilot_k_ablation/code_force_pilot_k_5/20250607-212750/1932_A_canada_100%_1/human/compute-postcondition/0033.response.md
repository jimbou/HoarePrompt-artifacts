The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. The stdin still contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases. Therefore, the Output State is: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character in `s`, the values of `ret` depends on the value of `i`, and `thorn` is increased by 1, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases.
