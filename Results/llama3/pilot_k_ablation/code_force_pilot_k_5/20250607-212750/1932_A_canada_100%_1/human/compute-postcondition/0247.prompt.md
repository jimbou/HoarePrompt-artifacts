Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains at least 0 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1 or 2, stdin contains at least 0 test cases. If the first character `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If the first character `i` is '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is either 1 or 2. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the first character `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1 or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` equals '@', `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` does not equal '*' or '@', `ret` is either 0 or 1 and `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, or 3, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the third character in the list if `i` is '@'. Otherwise, `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases. If the fourth character `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases. If the fifth character `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 1 if `i` is not '@', otherwise `thorn` is set to 1 if `ret` is not 5. If `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
