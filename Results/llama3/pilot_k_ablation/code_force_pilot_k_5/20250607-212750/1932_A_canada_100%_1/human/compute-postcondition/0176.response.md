Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 2 if the third character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@' and 0 if `i` is not '@'. `stdin` contains either t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain the same, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
