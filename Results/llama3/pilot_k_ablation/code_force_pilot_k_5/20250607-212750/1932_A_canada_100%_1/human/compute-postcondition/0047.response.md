Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters, `ret` is an integer between 0 and `len`, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, stdin contains `t-1` test cases.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the length of the string `s` remains unchanged, the string `s` itself remains unchanged, the value of `ret` is increased by the number of '@' characters in the string `s`, the value of `thorn` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the last character in the string `s` is '*' or not, and the number of test cases in stdin remains unchanged.
