To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(int(input())):`. The objects involved are `_` (a throwaway variable), `int(input())`, and `stdin`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:

* `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000
* `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters
* `ret` is an integer between 0 and `len`
* `thorn` is either 0 or 1
* `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4, or t-5 test cases

To execute the loop again, we need to adjust the state of `stdin`. Since `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4, or t-5 test cases, and one test case has already been processed, we need to decrement the number of test cases in `stdin`.

State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least `len` characters, `ret` is an integer between 0 and `len`, `thorn` is either 0 or 1, and `stdin` contains either t-4, t-5, or t-6 test cases**

Note that we didn't adjust the states of `len`, `s`, `ret`, or `thorn` because they are not involved in the loop head.
