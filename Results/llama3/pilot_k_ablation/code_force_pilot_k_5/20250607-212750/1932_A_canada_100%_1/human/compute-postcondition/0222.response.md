Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1 or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` equals '@', `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` equals '*', `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` does not equal '*' or '@', `ret` is either 0 or 1 and `thorn` is 0.***
