Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character in the list `s`. If `thorn` is 2, then if `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2 or 3 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is not 3. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 4, or 5. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `thorn` is not 2, then if `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2 or 3 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If `thorn` is 3, then `thorn` is 2. `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.**
