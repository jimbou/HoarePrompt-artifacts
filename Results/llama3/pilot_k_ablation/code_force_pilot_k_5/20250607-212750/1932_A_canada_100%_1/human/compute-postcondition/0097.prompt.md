Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of len characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of len characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 1 if the first character in the list, i, is '@', otherwise ret is 0. thorn is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases if i is not '*', otherwise if i is '*' and thorn is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases. i is the first character in the list. If i is '*', then the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if thorn is 2, otherwise the program continues with the else part. If i is not '*', then the program continues with the else part.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 2 characters. If the second character `i` is '@', `ret` is 1 plus its original value. If the second character `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases. If the first character is not '*', `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If the first character is '*' and `thorn` is not 2, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases. If `i` is not '*' or '@', then `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases if the first character is not '*', otherwise if the first character is '*' and `thorn` is 2, `stdin` contains `t-4` test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `stdin` contains `t-3` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len-1` characters that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least len characters, `i` is the len character in the list, `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '@', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len+1` characters that must have at least len+1 characters, `i` is the len+1 character in the list, `ret` is increased by 1. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `thorn` remains 1. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `thorn` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
