Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2 or 3, stdin contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the second character in the list and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains at least 0 test cases. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside.
