Output State: **len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of len characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 0, the current value of thorn is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases, the first character in the list, i, is equal to '*', and i is not equal to '@', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables len, s, ret, and thorn remain unchanged. The stdin still contains t-4 test cases. The first character in the list, i, is still equal to '*', and i is still not equal to '@'. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
