Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, or 3, `thorn` is 0, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the third character in the list if `i` is '@'. Otherwise, `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases, `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
