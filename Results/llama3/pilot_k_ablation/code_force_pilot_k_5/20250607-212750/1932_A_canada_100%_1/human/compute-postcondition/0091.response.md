Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len+1` characters that must have at least len+1 characters, `i` is the len+1 character in the list, `ret` is increased by 1, `thorn` is 1**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1, resulting in `thorn` being equal to 1. The other variables remain unchanged, with `len` still being an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` still being a list of `len+1` characters, `i` still being the `len+1` character in the list, and `ret` still being increased by 1.
