Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and `i` is the first character in the list. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0 and `i` is not equal to '@'.***
