Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character in `s`, and `ret` depends on the value of `i`. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases.***
