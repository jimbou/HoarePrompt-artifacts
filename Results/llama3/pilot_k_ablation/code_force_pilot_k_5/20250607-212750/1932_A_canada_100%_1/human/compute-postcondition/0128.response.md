Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then the state of the variables remains unchanged. `stdin` contains either t-3 or t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` is reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to `i` being '@' or '*' are still valid, but the value of `thorn` is now 0 in all cases. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
