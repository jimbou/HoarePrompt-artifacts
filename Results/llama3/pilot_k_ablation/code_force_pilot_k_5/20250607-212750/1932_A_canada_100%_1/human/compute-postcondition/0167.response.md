Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is 1 if the second character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `thorn` is either 1 or 2 if the second character `i` in the list `s` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 1. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1. If the second character `i` in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
