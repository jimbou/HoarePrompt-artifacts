Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is 2 if the third character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 1 if `i` is '@' and 0 if `i` is not '@'. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 3, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1. If the third character `i` in the list `s` is '*', then `thorn` is either 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 3, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 1. The values of the other variables remain the same.
