Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1 from its original value, and `thorn` is 1, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 2, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is 1, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been incremented by 1. If `i` is '@', `thorn` is now 1, and if `i` is '*', `thorn` is now 2. The values of the other variables remain the same. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The number of test cases in stdin has not changed if `thorn` is not equal to 2.
