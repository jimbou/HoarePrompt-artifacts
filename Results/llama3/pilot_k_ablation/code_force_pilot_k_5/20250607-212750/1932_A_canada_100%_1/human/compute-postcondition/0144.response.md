Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `thorn` is 0 and `ret` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is 0. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is 0. `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `thorn` has been reset to 0, regardless of its previous value. The values of `len`, `s`, `i`, and `ret` remain unchanged. The condition for `ret` when `i` is '@' still holds, but the conditions for `ret` and `thorn` when `i` is '*' or not '*' and not '@' have been updated to reflect the new value of `thorn`. The number of test cases in `stdin` remains the same.
