Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 2 or 3 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `thorn` is 2, then `thorn` is 1. `stdin` contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.**
