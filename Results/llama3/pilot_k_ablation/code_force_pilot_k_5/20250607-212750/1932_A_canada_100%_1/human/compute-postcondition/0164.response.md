Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 1 if the first character `i` in the list `s` is '@', otherwise `ret` is 0. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, or t-3 test cases. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the program continues with its normal execution. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.***
