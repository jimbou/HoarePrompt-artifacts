Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in the list. If `i` is '@', `ret` is either 3, 4, or 5, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains either t-1, t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases. If `i` is '*', `ret` is either 2, 3, or 4, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and stdin contains either t-2, t-3, t-4, or t-5 test cases. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with its execution. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', `ret` is either 2, 3, or 4, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains either t-1, t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases.***
