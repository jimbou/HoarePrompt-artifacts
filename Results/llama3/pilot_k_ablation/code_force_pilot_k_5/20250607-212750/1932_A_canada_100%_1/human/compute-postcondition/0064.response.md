Postcondition: ***len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of len characters that must have at least 1 character, ret is 1 if the first character in the list, i, is '@', otherwise ret is 0. thorn is 0, stdin contains t-3 test cases if i is not '*', otherwise if i is '*' and thorn is 2, stdin contains t-4 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise stdin contains t-3 test cases. i is the first character in the list. If i is '*', then the program either breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if thorn is 2, otherwise the program continues with the else part. If i is not '*', then the program continues with the else part.***
