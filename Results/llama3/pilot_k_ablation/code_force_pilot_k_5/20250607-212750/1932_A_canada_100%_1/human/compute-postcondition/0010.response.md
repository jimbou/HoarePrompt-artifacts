Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of n characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is either 1 or 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `i` is '*', and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
