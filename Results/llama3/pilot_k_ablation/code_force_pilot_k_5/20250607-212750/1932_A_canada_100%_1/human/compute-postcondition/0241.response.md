Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, `ret` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, `thorn` is either 1, 2, or 3, `stdin` contains at least 0 test cases. If the fifth character `i` is '@', `ret` is either 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is set to 2. If `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In natural language, the output state is: The length is still between 1 and 1000, the list of characters still has at least 5 characters, and the return value is still one of 1, 2, 3, or 4. The thorn value has been incremented by 1, so it is now either 1, 2, or 3. The stdin still contains at least 0 test cases. The conditions for the fifth character and the thorn value still apply, but now if the thorn value is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
