Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of n characters, ret is 0, thorn is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.
Code of the loop:
for i in s:
    if i == '@':
        thorn = 0
        ret += 1
    elif i == '*':
        thorn += 1
        if thorn == 2:
            break
    else:
        thorn = 0


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2, stdin contains `t-1` test cases, and `i` is the first character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1 or 2, and if `thorn` is 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 and `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 2 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, or 3, stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases, and `i` is the second character in the list. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is 2 and `thorn` is 0. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 2 or 3, and if `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is neither '@' nor '*', then `ret` is 0 or 1 and `thorn` is 0. If `thorn` is 2, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0 or 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 3 characters. If the third character `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 1, 2, or 3, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases. If `i` is not '@', then `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, and `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 0.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1 from its original value, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. Otherwise, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 5 characters, `i` is the fifth character in `s`. If `i` is '@', `ret` is increased by 1 from its original value, `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1. If `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement and stdin contains `t-2` test cases. If `i` is not '@' or '*', `thorn` is 0, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases. If `i` is not '@', `ret` is not increased, and `thorn` is 1 if `i` is '*', otherwise `thorn` is 0.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
