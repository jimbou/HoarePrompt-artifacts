Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len-1` characters that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the next character in the list. If `i` is '*', `thorn` is increased by 1, and if `thorn` equals 2, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, if `i` is not '*', `thorn` is 0.**
