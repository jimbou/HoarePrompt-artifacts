To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in s:`, where `s` is a list of characters and `i` is the character being iterated over.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 3 characters.
- The conditions regarding `ret`, `thorn`, and `stdin` are based on the value of the third character `i` in the list `s`.

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we consider the following:

1. **List `s`**: Since `s` must have at least 3 characters for the loop to execute again, and we are iterating over each character in `s`, the list `s` itself does not change in terms of its length or content. However, the loop will move to the next character.

2. **Character `i`**: At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be the next character in the list `s`. Since we are not given the specific content of `s` beyond the third character, we can only say that `i` will be the fourth character in `s` if the loop executes again.

3. **Variable `len`**: The length of `s` does not change because we are iterating over its existing elements. Therefore, `len` remains an integer between 1 and 1000.

4. **Variables `ret` and `thorn`**: These variables' values depend on the value of `i` and the conditions specified. However, since we are moving to the next character in `s` and do not know its value, we cannot determine the exact values of `ret` and `thorn` at the start of the next iteration. Their values will be determined based on the new value of `i`.

5. **stdin**: The state of `stdin` (containing `t-1`, `t-2` test cases) is not directly affected by the loop iteration over `s`. Its state remains as is unless modified within the loop body, which is not provided.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop can be described as follows:

State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 4 characters, `i` is the fourth character in `s`, the values of `ret` and `thorn` depend on the value of `i`, and stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases.**

Note: The exact values of `ret` and `thorn` cannot be determined without knowing the value of the fourth character `i` in `s`.
