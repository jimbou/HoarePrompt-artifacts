Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `i` is '@', then `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 1. `stdin` contains either t-4 or t-5 test cases.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, and the number of test cases in `stdin` is reduced by 1.
