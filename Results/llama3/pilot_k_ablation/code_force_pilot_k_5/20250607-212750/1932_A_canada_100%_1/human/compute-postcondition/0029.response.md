Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least 3 characters, `ret` is either 0, 1, or 2, `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, stdin contains `t-1`, `t-2` test cases, and `i` is the third character in the list. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change occurs. If `i` is not '*', then `thorn` is 0.***
