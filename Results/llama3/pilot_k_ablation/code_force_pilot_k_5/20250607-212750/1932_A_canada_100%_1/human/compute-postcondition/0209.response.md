Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `i` is the first character in the list and its current value is '*', `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, stdin contains at least 0 test cases and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `i`, `ret`, and `thorn` remain unchanged. The only change is that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The stdin still contains at least 0 test cases.
