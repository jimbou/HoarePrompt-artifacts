The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and list s, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list s.  If the list has at least len characters the loop executes again for the len time. At the end of the last iteration, s has len-1 characters, i is the next character in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least len characters and the i is the len character in the list.
State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `len` characters that must have at least len characters, `i` is the len character in the list, `thorn` is 0, `ret` is increased by 1**
