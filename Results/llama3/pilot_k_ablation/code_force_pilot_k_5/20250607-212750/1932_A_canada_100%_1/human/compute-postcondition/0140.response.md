Output State: **len is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of characters that must have at least 5 characters, i is the fifth character in the list s. If i is '@', then thorn is 0 and ret is either 2, 3, 4, or 5. If i is '*', then thorn is 1 and ret is either 0 or 1. If i is not '*' and not '@', then ret is either 1 or 2, thorn is either 0, 1, 4, or 5. If thorn is 2 or 3, then thorn is 1 or 2 respectively. stdin contains either t-3, t-4 or t-5 test cases.**

The first line sets `thorn` to 0. The second line increments `ret` by 1. Since `ret` was either 1, 2, 3, or 4 when `i` is '@', it becomes either 2, 3, 4, or 5. When `i` is '*', `ret` was either 0 or 1, so it becomes either 1 or 2. When `i` is not '*' and not '@', `ret` was either 0 or 1, so it becomes either 1 or 2. The value of `thorn` is set to 0, so it is no longer 2 or 3. The values of `len`, `s`, `i`, and `stdin` are not affected by the code.
