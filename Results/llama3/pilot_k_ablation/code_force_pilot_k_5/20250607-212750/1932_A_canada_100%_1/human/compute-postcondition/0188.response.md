Postcondition: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 4 characters. If the fourth character `i` in the list `s` is '@', then `ret` is 4. Otherwise, `ret` is 3 if `i` is '@' and 2 if `i` is not '@'. `thorn` is either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4, and if `thorn` is 3, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is either 0, 1, or 2. `stdin` contains either t-1, t-2, t-3, or t-4 test cases. If `thorn` is 2, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues with the current state.**
