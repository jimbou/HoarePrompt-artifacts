Postcondition: ***`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 3 characters, `i` is the third character in the list `s`. If `thorn` is 2, then if `i` is '@', `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 1. `stdin` contains either t-4 or t-5 test cases. If `thorn` is not 2, then if `i` is '@', `ret` is either 1 or 2 and `thorn` is 1. If `i` is not '@', then `ret` is either 0 or 1, `thorn` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4. If `i` is '*', then if `thorn` is 3, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `i` is not '*' and not '@', then `thorn` is 1. `stdin` contains either t-3 or t-4 test cases.***
