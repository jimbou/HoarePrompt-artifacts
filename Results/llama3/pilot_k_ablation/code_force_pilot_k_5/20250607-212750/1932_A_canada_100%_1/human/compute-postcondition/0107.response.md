The value of `thorn` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `thorn` was 0, so the new value of `thorn` is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 1, `stdin` contains t-3 test cases, and the first character in the list `s`, `i`, is equal to '*'.
