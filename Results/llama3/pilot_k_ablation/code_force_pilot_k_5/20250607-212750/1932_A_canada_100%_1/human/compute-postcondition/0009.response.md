Output State: **`len` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of n characters that must have at least 1 character, `ret` is 0, `thorn` is 2, stdin contains t-1 test cases, `i` is '*', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

In this output state, the values of the variables `len`, `s`, `ret`, `thorn`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still '*', and we have broken out of the most internal loop or if statement.
