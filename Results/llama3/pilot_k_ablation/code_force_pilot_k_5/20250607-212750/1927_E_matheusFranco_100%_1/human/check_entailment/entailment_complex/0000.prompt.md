Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given two integers n and k (k \le n ), where k is even.

A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1
to n in any order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is
not a permutation (as 2 appears twice in the array) and [0,1,2] is also not a
permutation (as n=3 , but 3 is not present in the array).

Your task is to construct a k -level permutation of length n .

A permutation is called k -level if, among all the sums of continuous segments
of length k (of which there are exactly n - k + 1 ), any two sums differ by no
more than 1 .

More formally, to determine if the permutation p is k -level, first construct
an array s of length n - k + 1 , where s_i=\sum_{j=i}^{i+k-1} p_j , i.e., the
i -th element is equal to the sum of p_i, p_{i+1}, \dots, p_{i+k-1} .

A permutation is called k -level if \max(s) - \min(s) \le 1 .

Find any k -level permutation of length n .

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) â€”
the number of test cases. This is followed by the description of the test
cases.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (2 \le
k \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 , k is even), where n is the length of the desired
permutation.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output any k -level permutation of length n .

It is guaranteed that such a permutation always exists given the constraints.

Example

Input

    5
    
    2 2
    
    3 2
    
    10 4
    
    13 4
    
    7 4

Output

    2 1
    1 3 2
    1 8 4 10 2 7 5 9 3 6
    4 10 1 13 5 9 2 12 6 8 3 11 7
    1 6 3 7 2 5 4
    
Note

In the second test case of the example:

  * p_1 + p_2 = 3 + 1 = 4 ; 
  * p_2 + p_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 . 

The maximum among the sums is 4 , and the minimum is 3 .

#Function 1:

    n, k = map(int, input().split(' '))

    #State: permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, bottom_v is n/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k), top_v is n/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n-1)/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k), idx is k, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than idx + (n - idx - 1) // k * k.
    result = ' '.join([str(v) for v in permutation])
    print(result)
    #This is printed: a string containing the elements of permutation separated by spaces, where permutation is a list of n values, with permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] being either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, and bottom_v and top_v being calculated based on the given formulas and the values of n, k, and idx

#Overall this is what the function does:This function generates a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is a positive integer, and prints the permutation as a string of space-separated values. The permutation is constructed by iterating through the numbers in a specific pattern, where every k-th number is assigned a value from either the bottom or top half of the range, depending on the parity of the index. The function takes two inputs, n and k, from the standard input, where k is a positive even integer less than or equal to n. The function does not return any value but prints the resulting permutation as a string.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains one input: an integer (greater than 0).
    t = int(input())
    while t > 0:
        func_1()
        
        t -= 1
        
    #State: t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input

#Overall this is what the function does:Repeats a function call (func_1) a specified number of times based on user input, consuming all input from stdin and leaving no input remaining.
