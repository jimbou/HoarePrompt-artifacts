Reasoning:

The problem requires constructing a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. A k-level permutation is one where the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1.

The provided program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_2` reads the number of test cases and calls `func_1` for each test case.

`func_1` reads the values of n and k, initializes an array `permutation` of length n with zeros, and sets two pointers `bottom_v` and `top_v` to 1 and n, respectively. It then iterates over the indices of the permutation array in steps of k, assigning values to the array elements in an alternating pattern. If the index is even, it assigns the value of `bottom_v` and increments it; if the index is odd, it assigns the value of `top_v` and decrements it.

The key insight here is that by alternating between assigning values from the bottom and top of the range [1, n], the program ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k will be close to each other. Specifically, the sums will differ by at most 1, which is the requirement for a k-level permutation.

The program then prints the constructed permutation as a string of space-separated values.

Based on this analysis, the program appears to be correct. It correctly constructs a k-level permutation of length n for each test case, and the output format matches the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
