Reasoning: 
The given program is designed to generate a k-level permutation of length n, where k is even. The program consists of two functions: func_1 and func_2. 

func_1 takes two inputs, n and k, from the standard input and generates a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. The permutation is constructed by iterating through the numbers in a specific pattern, where every k-th number is assigned a value from either the bottom or top half of the range, depending on the parity of the index. This approach ensures that the sums of continuous segments of length k differ by no more than 1, meeting the condition for a k-level permutation.

func_2 repeats the call to func_1 a specified number of times based on user input, consuming all input from stdin and leaving no input remaining.

Based on the provided execution summaries, it is clear that func_1 correctly generates a k-level permutation of length n, and func_2 repeats this process for multiple test cases.

Therefore, the given program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
