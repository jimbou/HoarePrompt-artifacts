Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 4k, permutation is a list of n values where n is greater than idx + 4k + 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 3k] is either bottom_v - 1 or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k] is bottom_v if idx is even or top_v if idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v if idx is even or top_v - 1 if idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, bottom_v is two more than its original value if idx is even, top_v is three less than its original value if idx is odd, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 4k + 1**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the value of `top_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`. The second line decrements `top_v` by 1. No other variables are affected. The value of `bottom_v` remains two more than its original value if `idx` is even, and the value of `top_v` becomes three less than its original value if `idx` is odd.
