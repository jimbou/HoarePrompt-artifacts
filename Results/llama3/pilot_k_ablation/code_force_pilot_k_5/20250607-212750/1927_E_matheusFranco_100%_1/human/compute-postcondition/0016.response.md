Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is an even positive integer and k < n and 2k < n, permutation is a list of n values. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is 3, otherwise it is n-1. If idx is even, bottom_v is 4, otherwise it is 2. If idx is even, top_v is n, otherwise it is n-2. idx is either even or odd, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 2k, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` has been updated to `bottom_v`, which is 3 if `idx` is even and 2 if `idx` is odd. The value of `bottom_v` has been incremented by 1, making it 4 if `idx` is even and 3 if `idx` is odd. All other variables remain unchanged.
