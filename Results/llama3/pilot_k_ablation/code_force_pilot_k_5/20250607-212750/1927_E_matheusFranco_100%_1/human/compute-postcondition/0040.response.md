Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v which is n/2 + 1 if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v which is n/2 - 1 if n is even, otherwise it is (n-1)/2 - 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`. The rest of the variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state. The permutation list still has the same properties, with its values at specific indices determined by the parity of `idx`. The stdin remains empty, and the relationships between `k`, `idx`, and `n` are still valid.
