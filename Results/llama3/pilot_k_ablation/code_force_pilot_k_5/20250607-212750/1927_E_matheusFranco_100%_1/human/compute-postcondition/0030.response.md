Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `bottom_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2`, `top_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2`, `idx` is either even or odd, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `n`, stdin is empty.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of `n` values where each value is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`. The value of `bottom_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2`. The value of `top_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2`. The value of `idx` is either even or odd, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `n`. The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body remains unchanged.
