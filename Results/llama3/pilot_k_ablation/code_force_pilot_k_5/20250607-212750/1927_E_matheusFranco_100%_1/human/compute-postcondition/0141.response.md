Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, top_v is decremented by 1, idx is incremented by 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is incremented by k, and either bottom_v is incremented by 1 if idx is even or top_v is decremented by 1 if idx is odd.**

In this output state, the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] has been updated to top_v, and top_v has been decremented by 1. The value of idx has been incremented by 1, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx has been incremented by k. Additionally, either bottom_v has been incremented by 1 if idx is even or top_v has been decremented by 1 if idx is odd. The rest of the permutation list remains unchanged.
