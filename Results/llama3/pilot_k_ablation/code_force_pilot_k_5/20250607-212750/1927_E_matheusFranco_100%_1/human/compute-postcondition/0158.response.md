Output: **a string containing the elements of permutation separated by spaces, where permutation is a list of n values, with permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] being either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, and bottom_v and top_v being calculated based on the given formulas and the values of n, k, and idx**
