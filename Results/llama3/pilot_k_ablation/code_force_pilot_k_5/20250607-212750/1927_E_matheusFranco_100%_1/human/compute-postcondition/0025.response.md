The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 4k, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. Since `n` > 3k, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, so no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` > 3k, `k` is an even positive integer and `k` < `n` and 2k < `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 2 if `idx` % 2 == 0, otherwise it is 3. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n-2` if `idx` % 2 != 0, otherwise it is `n`. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is 3 if `idx` % 2 == 0, otherwise it is 4. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is 2 if `idx` % 2 != 0, otherwise it is 3. If `idx` is even, `top_v` is `n-2` if `idx` % 2 == 0, otherwise it is `n-1`. If `idx` is even, `top_v` is `n-3` if `idx` % 2 != 0, otherwise it is `n-2`. `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 4k, `idx` is either even or odd, stdin is empty.**
