Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k, bottom_v is increased by 1**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, and the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is set to `bottom_v`. The value of `bottom_v` is also increased by 1. The values of `k`, `idx`, and `n` remain unchanged. The stdin remains empty.
