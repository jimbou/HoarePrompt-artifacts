Output State: **t is greater than -1**

The first line calls the function `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its effect on the program state. The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` was initially greater than 0, after decrementing, it will be greater than -1. No other variables are affected.
