The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`.  If `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2k`, and `permutation` is a list of `n` values. So for the loop to be executed one more time `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2k`, `idx + 2k` must be less than `n`. Also, `n` must be greater than `idx + 2k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 2k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx + 2k`.**
