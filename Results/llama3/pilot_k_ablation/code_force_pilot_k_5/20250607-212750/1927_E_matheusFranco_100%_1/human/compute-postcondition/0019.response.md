Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an even positive integer and `k` < `n` and `2k` < `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n-1`, otherwise it is `n`. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is `2`, otherwise it is `3`. If `idx` is even, `top_v` is `n-2`, otherwise it is `n-1`. `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `3k`, `idx` is either even or odd, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `3k` by adding `k` to its previous value of `2k`. The conditions for `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`, `bottom_v`, and `top_v` have been updated accordingly based on the new value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The other variables remain unchanged.
