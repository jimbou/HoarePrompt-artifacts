Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 5k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `n` is greater than `idx + 5k + 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 4k]` is either `bottom_v - 1` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 3k]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v` if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v` if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd, `bottom_v` is three more than its original value if `idx` is even or one more than its original value if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is two less than its original value if `idx` is odd, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx + 5k + 1`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`, and its new value is `idx + 5k`. The list `permutation` remains the same, but the indices of its elements have shifted due to the change in `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. The values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` remain the same, but their relationships with the elements of `permutation` have changed due to the shift in indices. The other variables, including `stdin`, `k`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
