The variable in the loop head is multiples_of_k_plus_idx and len(permutation). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable multiples_of_k_plus_idx and len(permutation). If multiples_of_k_plus_idx is less than len(permutation), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 3k, len(permutation) is n, and n is greater than idx + 2k. n being greater than idx + 2k does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than idx + 3k. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 3k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k] is either bottom_v - 1 or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v and bottom_v is one more than its original value. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is top_v and top_v is one less than its original value. stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 3k.**
