Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. bottom_v is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, and bottom_v is increased by 1. The value of idx is not explicitly mentioned, but it is implied that it is even, as the code assigns bottom_v to permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] and then increments bottom_v. The values of k, n, and the length of permutation are not modified by the code, so they remain the same as in the initial state. Stdin is still empty, as no input is read or written.
