Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is top_v - 1 and top_v is one less than its original value.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`. The list `permutation` remains the same, but the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` now points to a different element. The values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` are updated based on the parity of `idx`. The other variables, `stdin`, `k`, and `n`, remain unchanged.
