Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 4k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 3k]` is either `bottom_v - 1` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k]` is `bottom_v`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `bottom_v`, and `bottom_v` is two more than its original value. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k]` is `top_v`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `top_v - 1`, and `top_v` is two less than its original value. `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx + 4k`.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has increased by `k`. The list `permutation` still has `n` values, but the indices that were previously affected by `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` have shifted by `k`. The values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` have changed based on the parity of `idx`, and the conditions on `k` and `n` are still satisfied.
