Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The code block consists of two lines. The first line calls a function named `func_1()`, but since the function's definition is not provided, we cannot determine its exact effect on the program state. However, we can infer that it does not modify the value of `t` or the state of stdin, as there is no indication of such changes.

The second line decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is initially an integer greater than 0, after this line executes, `t` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0.

The state of stdin remains unchanged, as there is no input operation performed in the code block.

Therefore, the final output state is: `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and stdin contains no input.
