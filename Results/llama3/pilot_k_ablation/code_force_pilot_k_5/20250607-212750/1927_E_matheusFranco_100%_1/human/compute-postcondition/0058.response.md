Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n by at least 1, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1, and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is now top_v, and top_v has been decreased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The precondition that permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx is no longer valid, as permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is now always top_v.
