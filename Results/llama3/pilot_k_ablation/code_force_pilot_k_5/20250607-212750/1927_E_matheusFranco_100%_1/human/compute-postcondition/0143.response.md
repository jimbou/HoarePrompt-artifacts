Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than or equal to len(permutation), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, idx is less than k, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v + 1 if idx is even or top_v - 1 if idx is odd, and either bottom_v is incremented by 1 if idx is even or top_v is decremented by 1 if idx is odd.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`, and it is now less than or equal to the length of the `permutation` list. The `permutation` list remains the same, with the same values at the same indices, except for the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, which has been updated to either `bottom_v + 1` if `idx` is even or `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd. The values of `idx`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged.
