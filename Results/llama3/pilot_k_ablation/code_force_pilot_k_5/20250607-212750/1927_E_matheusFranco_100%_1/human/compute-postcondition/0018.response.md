Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, k is an even positive integer and k < n and 2k < n, permutation is a list of n values. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is 3, otherwise it is n-1. If idx is even, bottom_v is 4, otherwise it is 2. If idx is even, top_v is n, otherwise it is n-2. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n, otherwise it is n-1. If idx is odd, bottom_v is 3, otherwise it is 2. If idx is odd, top_v is n-1, otherwise it is n-2. idx is either even or odd, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 2k, stdin is empty.***
