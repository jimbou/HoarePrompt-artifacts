To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than or equal to `len(permutation)`, so we need to adjust `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to be less than `len(permutation)`.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, idx is less than k, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v + 1 if idx is even or top_v - 1 if idx is odd, and either bottom_v is incremented by 1 if idx is even or top_v is decremented by 1 if idx is odd.**
