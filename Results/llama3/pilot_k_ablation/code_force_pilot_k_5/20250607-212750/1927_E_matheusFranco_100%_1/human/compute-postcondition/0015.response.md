The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, `k` is an even positive integer and `k` < `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. For the loop to be executed one more time, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` must be less than `n`, so `2k` must be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an even positive integer and `k` < `n` and `2k` < `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 2, otherwise it is `n-1`. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is 3, otherwise it is 2. If `idx` is even, `top_v` is `n`, otherwise it is `n-2`. `idx` is either even or odd, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, stdin is empty.**
