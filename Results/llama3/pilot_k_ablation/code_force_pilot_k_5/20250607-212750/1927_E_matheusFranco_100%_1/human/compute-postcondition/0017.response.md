Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is an even positive integer and k < n and 2k < n, permutation is a list of n values. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n, otherwise it is n-1. If idx is even, bottom_v is 3, otherwise it is 2. If idx is even, top_v is n-1, otherwise it is n-2. idx is either even or odd, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 2k, stdin is empty.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer. The value of `k` also remains unchanged as an even positive integer, which is less than `n` and also less than half of `n`. The list `permutation` still contains `n` values, but the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is `2k`) has been updated. If `idx` is even, the value at this index is now `n`, otherwise it remains `n-1`. The values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` depend on whether `idx` is even or odd. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is 3 and `top_v` is `n-1`, otherwise `bottom_v` is 2 and `top_v` is `n-2`. The value of `idx` itself remains either even or odd, and `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still `2k`. The stdin remains empty.
