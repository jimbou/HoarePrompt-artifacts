Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` > 3k, `k` is an even positive integer and `k` < `n` and 2k < `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either 4 or 5 depending on whether `idx` is even or odd, otherwise `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v` - 1 where `top_v` is either `n-3`, `n-2`, or `n-1` depending on the parity of `idx`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is 5k, `idx` is either even or odd, stdin is empty.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been incremented by `k`, resulting in a new value of `5k`. The other variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being a positive integer greater than `3k`, `k` being an even positive integer less than `n` and `2k` less than `n`, and the `permutation` list still containing `n` values. The conditions for the values of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` also remain the same, depending on whether `idx` is even or odd. The stdin remains empty.
