Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now equal to `idx + 2k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `bottom_v` and `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `top_v - 1` and `top_v` is one less than its original value.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `idx + 2k` by adding `k` to its previous value. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
