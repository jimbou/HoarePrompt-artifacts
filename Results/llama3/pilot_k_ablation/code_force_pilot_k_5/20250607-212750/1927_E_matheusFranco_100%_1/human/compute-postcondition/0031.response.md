Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `bottom_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2`, `top_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2`, `idx` is either odd or even, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `n`, stdin is empty.**

The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `idx` is either even or odd, so the output state is: `idx` is either odd or even. The other variables are not affected, so the output state includes all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed.
