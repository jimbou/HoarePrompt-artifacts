Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer and n > 3k, k is an even positive integer and k < n and 2k < n, permutation is a list of n values. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is 2 if idx % 2 == 0, otherwise it is 3. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is n-2 if idx % 2 != 0, otherwise it is n. If idx is even, bottom_v is 3 if idx % 2 == 0, otherwise it is 4. If idx is even, bottom_v is 2 if idx % 2 != 0, otherwise it is 3. If idx is even, top_v is n-2 if idx % 2 == 0, otherwise it is n-1. If idx is even, top_v is n-3 if idx % 2 != 0, otherwise it is n-2. multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 3k, idx is either even or odd, stdin is empty.***
