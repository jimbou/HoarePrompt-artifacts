To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to focus on the condition in the while loop statement, which is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`. This means we need to adjust the state of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and/or `permutation` to ensure this condition remains true for the next iteration.

Given that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `3k` and `k` is an even positive integer, and considering the relationship between `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`, we need to ensure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` does not reach or exceed the length of `permutation` for the loop to execute again.

Since `permutation` is a list of `n` values and `n` is a positive integer, and given that `2k < n`, we can infer that `k` is less than half of `n`. However, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is `3k`) does not exceed the length of `permutation`, which is `n`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is to ensure that `n` is greater than `3k`, so that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains less than the length of `permutation` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` > `3k`, `k` is an even positive integer and `k` < `n` and `2k` < `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `n-1`, otherwise it is `n`. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is `2`, otherwise it is `3`. If `idx` is even, `top_v` is `n-2`, otherwise it is `n-1`. `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `3k`, `idx` is either even or odd, stdin is empty.**
