Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, idx is less than k, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k, top_v is decremented by 1.**

The first line of the code assigns the value of `top_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`. Since `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` was either `bottom_v + 1` if `idx` is even or `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd, this line changes its value to `top_v`. The second line decrements `top_v` by 1.
