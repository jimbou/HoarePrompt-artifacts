Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, top_v is one less than its original value, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2k.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains unchanged as `idx + 2k`. The list `permutation` is modified at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to be `top_v`. The value of `top_v` is decremented by 1. The state of `stdin`, `k`, and `n` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code.
