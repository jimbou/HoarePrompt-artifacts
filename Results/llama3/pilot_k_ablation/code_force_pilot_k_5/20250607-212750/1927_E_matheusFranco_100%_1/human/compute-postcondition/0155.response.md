Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v if idx is even or top_v - 1 if idx is odd, and either bottom_v is incremented by 1 if idx is even or top_v is decremented by 1 if idx is odd, idx is less than k, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to len(permutation), and idx is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The permutation list remains the same, but the index `idx` has been incremented by 1. The conditions on the values of `permutation` at specific indices, `idx`, `k`, and `n` still hold, but `idx` is now one more than its previous value.
