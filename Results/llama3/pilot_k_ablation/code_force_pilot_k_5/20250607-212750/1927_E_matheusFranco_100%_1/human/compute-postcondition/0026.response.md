Output State: **n is a positive integer and n > 3k, k is an even positive integer and k < n and 2k < n, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is either 4 or 5 depending on whether idx is even or odd, top_v is either n-3, n-2, or n-1 depending on the parity of idx, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 4k, idx is either even or odd, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `k` also remains the same as it is not affected by the code. The list `permutation` is modified at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` to store the value of `bottom_v`. The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1, so it becomes either 4 or 5 depending on whether `idx` is even or odd. The value of `top_v` is not modified by the code, so it remains either `n-3`, `n-2`, or `n-1` depending on the parity of `idx`. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains `4k` as it is not changed by the code. The value of `idx` remains either even or odd as it is not modified by the code. The stdin remains empty as no input is read or written.
