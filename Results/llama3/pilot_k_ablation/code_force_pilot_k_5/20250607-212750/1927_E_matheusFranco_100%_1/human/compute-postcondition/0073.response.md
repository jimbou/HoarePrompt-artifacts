Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is incremented by 1, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx.**

Here's a description of the output state in natural language:

The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains the same, which is `idx + k`. The list `permutation` still has `n` values, but the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now set to `bottom_v`. The value of `bottom_v` has been incremented by 1. The relationship between `k`, `idx`, and `n` remains the same, with `k` being greater than `idx + 1` and `n` being greater than `idx`.
