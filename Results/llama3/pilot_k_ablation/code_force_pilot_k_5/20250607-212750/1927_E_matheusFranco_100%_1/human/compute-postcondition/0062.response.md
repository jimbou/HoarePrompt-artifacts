Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `len(permutation)`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx`, and `n` is greater than `idx`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` which is `n/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)`. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v` which is `n/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)`. `idx` is incremented by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is that all variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state, except that the value of `idx` has been incremented by 1. The parity of `idx` may have changed, which affects the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`.
