The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. If `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of `permutation`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, and `n` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by at least `k`. To ensure the loop can execute again, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `permutation`. Since `n` is greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by at least `k`, we can conclude that the length of `permutation` is at least `n`. Therefore, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` needs to be less than `n`.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by k and is less than n, `permutation` is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.**
