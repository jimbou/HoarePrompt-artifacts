The variable in the loop head is variable t, so we can only adjust that one.According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t.  If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than -1, So for the loop to be executed one more time t must be greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0**
