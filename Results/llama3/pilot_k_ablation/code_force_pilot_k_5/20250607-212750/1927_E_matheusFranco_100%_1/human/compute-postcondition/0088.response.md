Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 4k, permutation is a list of n values where n is greater than idx + 4k + 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 3k] is either bottom_v - 1 or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k] is bottom_v if idx is even or top_v if idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v if idx is even or top_v - 1 if idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is three more than its original value if idx is even or one more than its original value if idx is odd, top_v is two less than its original value if idx is odd, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 4k + 1**
