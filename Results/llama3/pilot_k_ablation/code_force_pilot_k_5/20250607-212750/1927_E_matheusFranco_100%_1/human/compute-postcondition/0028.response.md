Postcondition: **n is a positive integer and n > 3k, k is an even positive integer and k < n and 2k < n, permutation is a list of n values. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either 4 or 5 depending on whether idx is even or odd, otherwise permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v - 1 where top_v is either n-3, n-2, or n-1 depending on the parity of idx, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 4k, idx is either even or odd, stdin is empty.**
