The first line assigns the value of `bottom_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`. Since `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, `permutation[idx]` becomes `bottom_v`. The second line increments `bottom_v` by 1. Since `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The third line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `idx` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `idx` is not incremented. The fourth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The fifth line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `bottom_v` by 1 if it is even. Since `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The sixth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The seventh line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `idx` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `idx` is not incremented. The eighth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The ninth line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `bottom_v` by 1 if it is even. Since `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The tenth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The eleventh line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `idx` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `idx` is not incremented. The twelfth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The thirteenth line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `bottom_v` by 1 if it is even. Since `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The fourteenth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The fifteenth line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `idx` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `idx` is not incremented. The sixteenth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The seventeenth line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `bottom_v` by 1 if it is even. Since `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The eighteenth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented. The nineteenth line checks the parity of `idx` and increments `idx` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `idx` is not incremented. The twentieth line checks the parity of `idx` and decrements `top_v` by 1 if it is odd. Since `idx` is even, `top_v` is not decremented.
