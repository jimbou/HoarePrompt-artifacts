Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is incremented by 1, idx is less than k, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is incremented by k and must be less than len(permutation)**
