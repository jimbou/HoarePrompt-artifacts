Postcondition: ***multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.***
