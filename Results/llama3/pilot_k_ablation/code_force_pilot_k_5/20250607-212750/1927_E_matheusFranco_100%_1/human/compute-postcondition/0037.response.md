Postcondition: ***`permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `bottom_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2`, `top_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2`, `idx` is odd, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx`, stdin is empty, `k` must be greater than the current value of `idx`, and `n` must be greater than the current value of `idx`***
