Postcondition: ***`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx`. Additionally, `idx` is odd***
