Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, bottom_v is n/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k), top_v is n/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n-1)/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k), idx is k, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than idx + (n - idx - 1) // k * k.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is a list of n values where each value is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx. The value of bottom_v is calculated as n/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k). The value of top_v is calculated as n/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n-1)/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k). The value of idx is k, and k is greater than idx. The value of n is greater than idx + (n - idx - 1) // k * k.
