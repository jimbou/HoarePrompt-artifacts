Postcondition: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 3k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k] is either bottom_v - 1 or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, and bottom_v is two more than its original value. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is top_v, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v - 1, and top_v is two less than its original value. stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 3k.**
