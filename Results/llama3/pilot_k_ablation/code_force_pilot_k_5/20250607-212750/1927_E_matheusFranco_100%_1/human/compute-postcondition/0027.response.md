Output State: **n is a positive integer and n > 3k, k is an even positive integer and k < n and 2k < n, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, top_v is top_v - 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is 4k, idx is either even or odd, stdin is empty.**

The code modifies the value of `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` to be `top_v`, and then decrements `top_v` by 1. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `permutation`, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`, and `idx` remain unchanged. The value of `top_v` is updated to be one less than its original value. The stdin remains empty.
