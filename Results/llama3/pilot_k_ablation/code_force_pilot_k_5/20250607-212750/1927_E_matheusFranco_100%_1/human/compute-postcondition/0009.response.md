According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable t. If t is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, t is greater than or equal to 0. However, this does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so t needs to be adjusted to t is greater than 0.
State: **t is greater than 0**
