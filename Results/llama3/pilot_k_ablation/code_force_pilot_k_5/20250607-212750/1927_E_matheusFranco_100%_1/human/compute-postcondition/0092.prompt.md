Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx`
Code of the loop:
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    if idx % 2 == 0:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
        bottom_v += 1
    else:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
        top_v -= 1
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v and bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is top_v - 1 and top_v is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now equal to `idx + 2k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `bottom_v` and `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `top_v` and `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `top_v - 1` and `top_v` is one less than its original value.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 3k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k] is either bottom_v - 1 or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v and bottom_v is one more than its original value. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is top_v and top_v is one less than its original value. stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2k.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 4k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 3k]` is either `bottom_v - 1` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx`. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k]` is `bottom_v`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `bottom_v`, and `bottom_v` is two more than its original value. If `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k]` is `top_v`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `top_v - 1`, and `top_v` is two less than its original value. `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx + 4k`.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx + 5k`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `n` is greater than `idx + 5k + 1`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 4k]` is either `bottom_v - 1` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx`, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 3k]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v` if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v` if `idx` is odd, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is `bottom_v` if `idx` is even or `top_v - 1` if `idx` is odd, `bottom_v` is three more than its original value if `idx` is even or one more than its original value if `idx` is odd, `top_v` is two less than its original value if `idx` is odd, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx + 5k + 1`.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
