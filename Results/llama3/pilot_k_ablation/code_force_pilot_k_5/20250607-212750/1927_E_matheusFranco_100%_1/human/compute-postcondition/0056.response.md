The only variable in the loop head is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `permutation`.  If `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `permutation`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by k and is less than n, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. So for the loop to be executed one more time the length of permutation needed to have been greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1 and multiples_of_k_plus_idx currently must be less than n by at least 1.
State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n by at least 1, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.**
