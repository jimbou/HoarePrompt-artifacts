Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx. The current value of idx is even, and bottom_v is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains unchanged as `idx`. The list `permutation` is modified such that the value at the index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now `bottom_v`. Since `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` was initially either `bottom_v` or `top_v`, but after the code execution, it is definitely `bottom_v`. The value of `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. The values of `stdin`, `k`, and `n` remain unchanged, and `idx` remains even.
