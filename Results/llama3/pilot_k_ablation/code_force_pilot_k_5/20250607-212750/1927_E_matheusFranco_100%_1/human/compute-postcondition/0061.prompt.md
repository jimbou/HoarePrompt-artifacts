Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished.

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `bottom_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2`, `top_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2`, `idx` is either odd or even, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx`, stdin is empty, `k` must be greater than the current value of `idx`.
Code of the loop:
while multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation):
    if idx % 2 == 0:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = bottom_v
        bottom_v += 1
    else:
        permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] = top_v
        top_v -= 1
    multiples_of_k_plus_idx += k


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:
Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by `k`, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v which is n/2 + 1 if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v which is n/2 - 1 if n is even, otherwise it is (n-1)/2 - 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is increased by k and is less than n, `permutation` is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 4 times: multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 5 times: multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n by at least 1, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.


What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
