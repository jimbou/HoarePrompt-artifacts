Output State: **`result` is a string containing the elements of `permutation` separated by spaces, `permutation` is a list of n values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `bottom_v` is `n/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)`, `top_v` is `n/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k)`, `idx` is `k`, `k` is greater than `idx`, and `n` is greater than `idx + (n - idx - 1) // k * k`.**

In natural language, the output state is that a new variable `result` is created, which is a string containing all the elements of the `permutation` list, separated by spaces. The `permutation` list remains unchanged, with its elements still following the specific pattern based on the parity of `idx`. The values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` are still dependent on whether `n` is even or odd, and `idx`, `k`, and `n` maintain their original relationships.
