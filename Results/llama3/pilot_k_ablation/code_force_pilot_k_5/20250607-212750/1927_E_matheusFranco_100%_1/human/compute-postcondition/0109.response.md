Output State: **permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is incremented by 1, idx is less than n, k is greater than idx + 2, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k.**

The code first assigns the value of `bottom_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`. Then, it increments `bottom_v` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The conditions on `idx`, `k`, and `n` are still valid after the code execution.
