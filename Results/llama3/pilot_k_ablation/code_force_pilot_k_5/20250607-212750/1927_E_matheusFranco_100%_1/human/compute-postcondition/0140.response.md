Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is less than len(permutation), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, idx is less than k, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k. If idx is even, bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, top_v is decremented by 1, and idx is incremented by 1. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, and bottom_v is incremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] has been updated to bottom_v. The value of bottom_v has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.
