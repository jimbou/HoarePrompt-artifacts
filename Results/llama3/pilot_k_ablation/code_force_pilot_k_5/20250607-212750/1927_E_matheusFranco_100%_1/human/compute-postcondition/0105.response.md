Output State: **permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v, top_v is one less than its original value, idx is less than n, k is greater than idx + 2, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k. If idx is even, bottom_v is incremented by 1. If idx is odd, top_v is decremented by 1.**

In this output state, the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] has been updated to top_v. The value of top_v has been decremented by 1. The values of idx, k, and n remain unchanged. The relationship between bottom_v and top_v has been updated based on the parity of idx.
