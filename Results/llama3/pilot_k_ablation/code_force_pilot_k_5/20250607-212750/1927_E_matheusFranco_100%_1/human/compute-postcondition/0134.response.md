To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the states of the variables involved in the condition.

The loop condition is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx < len(permutation)`. This means that the loop will continue to execute as long as `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than the length of the `permutation` list.

The states of the variables involved in the condition are:

* `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`: equal to `idx + k` if `idx` is even, otherwise equal to `idx + 1 + k`
* `permutation`: a list of `n` values with certain properties
* `idx`: less than `k`
* `k`: greater than `idx + 1`
* `n`: greater than `idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k`

To determine which states need to be adjusted, we need to consider what changes would allow the loop to execute one more time. Since the loop condition is based on the comparison between `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` and `len(permutation)`, we need to consider how to adjust these values to make the comparison true.

One possible adjustment is to increase the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. However, this would require changing the value of `idx` or `k`, which are not directly involved in the loop condition.

Another possible adjustment is to increase the length of the `permutation` list. However, this would require changing the value of `n`, which is not directly involved in the loop condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `multiples_of_k_plus_idx`. Specifically, its value needs to be less than the length of the `permutation` list.

State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is less than `len(permutation)`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v - 1` depending on the parity of `idx + 2`, ..., `permutation[idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx + k` if `idx` is even, otherwise `permutation[idx + 1]` is `top_v - 1`, `idx` is less than `k`, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k`. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is incremented by 1. If `idx` is odd, `top_v` is decremented by 1, and `idx` is incremented by 1.**
