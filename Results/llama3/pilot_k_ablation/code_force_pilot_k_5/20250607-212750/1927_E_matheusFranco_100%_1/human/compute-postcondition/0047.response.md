Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is increased by 1, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k.**

The code assigns the value of `bottom_v` to `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]`, making `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` equal to `bottom_v`. Then, it increments `bottom_v` by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. The value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is still increased by `k` and is less than `n`, `k` is still greater than `idx`, and `n` is still greater than `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` by at least `k`.
