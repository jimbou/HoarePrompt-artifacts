Output State: **`multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to `idx`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `stdin` is empty, `k` is greater than `idx + 1`, and `n` is greater than `idx`**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to be equal to `idx`, while the other variables remain unchanged. The list `permutation` still contains `n` values, and the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` (which is now `idx`) is still either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`. The stdin remains empty, and the relationships between `k`, `idx`, and `n` are still valid.
