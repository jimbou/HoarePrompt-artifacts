Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[idx - (n - idx - 4) // k * k] is either bottom_v or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx + 2, ..., permutation[idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx + k if idx is even, otherwise permutation[idx + 1] is top_v - 1, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v if idx is even or top_v - 1 if idx is odd, and either bottom_v is incremented by 1 if idx is even or top_v is decremented by 1 if idx is odd, idx is less than k, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2 + (n - idx - 3) // k * k, and multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to len(permutation).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the permutation list has been filled with values according to the given rules, and the multiples_of_k_plus_idx variable has reached the end of the permutation list. The values of idx, k, and n remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop head and body.
