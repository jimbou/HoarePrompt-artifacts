Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx has been increased by k and is still less than n. The permutation list remains the same, with its elements at multiples_of_k_plus_idx index being either bottom_v or top_v, depending on whether idx is even or odd. The stdin remains empty, and the relationships between k, idx, n, and the length of permutation remain the same. The values of bottom_v and top_v have been updated based on the parity of idx.
