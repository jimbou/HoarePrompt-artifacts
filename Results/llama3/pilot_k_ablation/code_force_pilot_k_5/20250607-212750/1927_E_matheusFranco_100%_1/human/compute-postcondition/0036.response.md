Output State: **permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is n/2 + 1 if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + 1, idx is even, multiples_of_k_plus_idx is idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than idx.**

In this output state, the value of permutation at the index multiples_of_k_plus_idx has been updated to bottom_v. The value of bottom_v has been incremented by 1. All other variables remain unchanged. The parity of idx is still even, and the relationship between k, idx, and n remains the same.
