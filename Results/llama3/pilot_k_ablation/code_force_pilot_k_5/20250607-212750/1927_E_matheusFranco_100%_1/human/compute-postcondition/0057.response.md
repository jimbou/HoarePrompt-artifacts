Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k and is less than n by at least 1, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1, and the length of permutation is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k+1, bottom_v is increased by 1, and top_v remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is now bottom_v, and bottom_v has been incremented by 1. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
