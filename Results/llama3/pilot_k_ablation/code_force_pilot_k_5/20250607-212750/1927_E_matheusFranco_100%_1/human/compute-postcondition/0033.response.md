Output State: **`permutation` is a list of `n` values where `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is either `bottom_v` or `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`, `bottom_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n+1)/2`, `top_v` is `n/2` if `n` is even, otherwise it is `(n-1)/2`, `idx` is either odd or even, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `idx`, stdin is empty, `k` must be greater than the current value of `idx`.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to be equal to `idx`. The other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
