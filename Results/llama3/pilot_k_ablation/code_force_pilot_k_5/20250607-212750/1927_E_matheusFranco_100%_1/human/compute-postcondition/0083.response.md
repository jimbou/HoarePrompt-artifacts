Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 3k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - 2k] is either bottom_v - 1 or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx. permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v and bottom_v is two more than its original value. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is top_v and top_v is one less than its original value. stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 3k.**

In this output state, the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] has been set to bottom_v. The value of bottom_v has been incremented by 1. The parity of idx determines the value of permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k], which is either bottom_v or top_v. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is bottom_v and bottom_v is two more than its original value. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is top_v and top_v is one less than its original value. All other variables and conditions remain unchanged.
