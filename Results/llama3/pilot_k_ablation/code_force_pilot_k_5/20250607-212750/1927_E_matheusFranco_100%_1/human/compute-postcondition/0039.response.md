Postcondition: ***permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v which is n/2 + 1 if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v which is n/2 - 1 if n is even, otherwise it is (n-1)/2 - 1.***
