Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `t` is an integer greater than or equal to 0, and the standard input (stdin) still contains no input. This is because the loop continues to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0, and in each iteration, `t` is decremented by 1. Once `t` reaches 0, the loop terminates. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
