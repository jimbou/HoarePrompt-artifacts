Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is increased by k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than multiples_of_k_plus_idx by at least k. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v and bottom_v is increased by 1. If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v and top_v is decreased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of multiples_of_k_plus_idx has been increased by k. The other variables remain unchanged. The permutation list still contains n values, and the value at the index multiples_of_k_plus_idx is still either bottom_v or top_v, depending on the parity of idx. The stdin remains empty, and the relationships between k, idx, and n are still valid.
