Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to idx + 2k, permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx - k] is either bottom_v - 1 or top_v - 1 depending on the parity of idx, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v, bottom_v is one more than its original value, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx + 1, and n is greater than idx + 2k.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` remains unchanged as `idx + 2k`. The list `permutation` has been modified such that the value at index `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is now set to `bottom_v`. The original value of `bottom_v` has been incremented by 1. All other variables and conditions remain the same as in the initial state.
