Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is an even positive integer and `k` < `n`, `permutation` is a list of `n` values. If `idx` is even, `permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx]` is 2, otherwise it is `n-1`. If `idx` is even, `bottom_v` is 3, otherwise it is 2. If `idx` is even, `top_v` is `n`, otherwise it is `n-2`. `idx` is either even or odd, `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is `2k`, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` has been updated to `2k` after adding `k` to its initial value of `k`. The other variables remain unchanged, and their properties and relationships are still valid.
