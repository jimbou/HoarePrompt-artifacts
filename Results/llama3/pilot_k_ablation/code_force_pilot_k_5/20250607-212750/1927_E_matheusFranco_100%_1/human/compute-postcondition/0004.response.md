Output State: **t is an integer greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains no input**

The code block consists of two lines: a function call `func_1()` and an assignment `t -= 1`. The function call does not affect any variables in the initial state, so we can ignore it for the purpose of determining the final state. The assignment `t -= 1` decrements the value of `t` by 1. Since `t` is initially an integer greater than 0, after the decrement, `t` will be an integer greater than or equal to 0. The state of stdin remains unchanged, as there is no input to process.
