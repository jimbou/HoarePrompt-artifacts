Output State: **multiples_of_k_plus_idx is equal to len(permutation), permutation is a list of n values where permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is either bottom_v or top_v depending on the parity of idx, stdin is empty, k is greater than idx, and n is greater than idx. If idx is even, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is bottom_v which is n/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n+1)/2 + (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k). If idx is odd, permutation[multiples_of_k_plus_idx] is top_v which is n/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k) if n is even, otherwise it is (n-1)/2 - (multiples_of_k_plus_idx/k).**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `multiples_of_k_plus_idx` is equal to the length of the permutation list, and the permutation list is filled with values that alternate between `bottom_v` and `top_v` depending on the parity of `idx`. The values of `bottom_v` and `top_v` are updated based on the number of iterations, and the other variables remain unchanged.
