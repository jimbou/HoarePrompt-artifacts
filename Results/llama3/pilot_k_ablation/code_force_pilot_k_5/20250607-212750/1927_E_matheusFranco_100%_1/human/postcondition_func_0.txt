This function generates a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, where n is a positive integer, and prints the permutation as a string of space-separated values. The permutation is constructed by iterating through the numbers in a specific pattern, where every k-th number is assigned a value from either the bottom or top half of the range, depending on the parity of the index. The function takes two inputs, n and k, from the standard input, where k is a positive even integer less than or equal to n. The function does not return any value but prints the resulting permutation as a string.
