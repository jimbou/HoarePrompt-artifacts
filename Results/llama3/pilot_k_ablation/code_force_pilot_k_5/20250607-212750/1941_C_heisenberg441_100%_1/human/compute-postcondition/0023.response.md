The variables in the loop head are i and n, so we can only adjust them.. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1, 3, or 5, `n` is greater than 5. `n` being greater than 5 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than `i`**
