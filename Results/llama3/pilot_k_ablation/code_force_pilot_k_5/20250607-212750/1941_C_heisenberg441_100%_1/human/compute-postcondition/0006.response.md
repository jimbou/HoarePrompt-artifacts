The code increments the value of `ans` by 1 and then increments the value of `i` by 3. 

Since `ans` was 0, it becomes 1. Since `i` was 0, it becomes 3. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **ans is 1, i is 3, s is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, n is greater than 0, the substring of s starting at index i and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie', and the current value of the substring of s starting at index i and having a length of 3 is not 'map'**
