The variables in the loop head are `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i`. `n` being greater than `i` does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than `i`.**
