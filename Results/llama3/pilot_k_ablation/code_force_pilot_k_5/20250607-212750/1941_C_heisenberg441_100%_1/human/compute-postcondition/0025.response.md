Output State: **s is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, n is greater than i, ans is incremented by 1, i is increased by 3**

In this final state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The relationship between `n` and `i` is still valid, with `n` being greater than `i`. The variable `ans` has been incremented by 1, and `i` has been increased by 3.
