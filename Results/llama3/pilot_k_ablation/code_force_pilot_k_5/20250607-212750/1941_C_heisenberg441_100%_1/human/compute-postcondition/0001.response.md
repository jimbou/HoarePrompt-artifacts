To ensure the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed, we need to analyze the loop condition `i < n`.

Given that `i` is 0 and `n` is the length of string `s`, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. This is because if `n` were 0 (meaning the string `s` is empty), the condition `i < n` would immediately be false, and the loop would not execute.

Therefore, the only adjustment needed is to ensure that `n`, which is the length of `s`, is greater than 0. This implies that `s` must not be an empty string.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
