Output State: **s is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, n is greater than i, ans is incremented by 1, i is incremented by 3**

In this output state, the value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The value of `n` is still greater than `i` because the increment operation on `i` does not affect the value of `n`. The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, and the value of `i` is incremented by 3.
