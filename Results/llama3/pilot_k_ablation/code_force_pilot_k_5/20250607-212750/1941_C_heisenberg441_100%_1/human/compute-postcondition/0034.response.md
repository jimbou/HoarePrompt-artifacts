Output State: **ans is increased by 1, i is increased by 3, s remains a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, n is greater than the new value of i**

The code snippet increments the value of `ans` by 1 and the value of `i` by 3. The initial state of `s` as a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters and `n` being greater than `i` remains unchanged. The value of `n` is still greater than the new value of `i` after the increment.
