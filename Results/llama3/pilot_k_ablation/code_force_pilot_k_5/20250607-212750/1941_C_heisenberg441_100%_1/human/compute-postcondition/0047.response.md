Output State: **ans is the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie' in s, i is equal to n.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable 'ans' will hold the total count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substrings 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie' in the string 's'. The variable 'i' will be equal to 'n', which is the length of the string 's', indicating that the loop has traversed the entire string.
