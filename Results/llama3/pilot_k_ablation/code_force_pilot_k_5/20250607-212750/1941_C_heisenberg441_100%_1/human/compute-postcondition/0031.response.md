The variable in the loop head is variable i and n, so we can only adjust them. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable i and n. If i is less than n, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, i is less than n, but n being greater than i does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to n is greater than i. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than `i`**
