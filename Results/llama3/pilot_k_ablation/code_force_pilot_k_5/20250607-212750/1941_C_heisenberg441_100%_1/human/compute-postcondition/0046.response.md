Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than `i`. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` is 'mapie', then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 5. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` is 'map', then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 3. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` is 'pie', then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 3. Otherwise, `i` is incremented by 1.***
