Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than `i`. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and of length 5 is 'mapie', then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 5. Otherwise, if the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and of length 3 is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is incremented by 1 and `i` is incremented by 3. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1.***
