Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `ans` is 0, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is not equal to 'mapie', the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'map', and the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is not equal to 'pie'**

The code increments the value of `i` by 1, so `i` is now 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The conditions related to the substrings of `s` starting at index `i` are still valid, as the increment of `i` does not affect the values of these substrings.
