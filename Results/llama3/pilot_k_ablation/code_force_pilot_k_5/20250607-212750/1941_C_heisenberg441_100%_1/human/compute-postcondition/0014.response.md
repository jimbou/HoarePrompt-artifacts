Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than 0. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is 'mapie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 5. If the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 5 is not 'mapie', then there are two possibilities: if the substring of `s` starting at index `i` and having a length of 3 is 'map' or 'pie', then `ans` is 1 and `i` is 3. Otherwise, `ans` is 0 and `i` is 1.***
