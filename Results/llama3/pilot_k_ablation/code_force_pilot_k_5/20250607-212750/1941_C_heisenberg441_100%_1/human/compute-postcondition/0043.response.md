Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is greater than `i`, and `i` is increased by 1.**

In this output state, the value of `i` has been incremented by 1, but its relationship with `n` remains the same, i.e., `n` is still greater than `i`. The string `s` remains unchanged, retaining its property of being a non-empty string of lowercase Latin letters.
