Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. It checks for the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" and increments the count whenever it finds any of these substrings. The program also correctly handles the case when the string is already beautiful by returning 0.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases. It checks for the longest substring "mapie" first, then for "map" and "pie". This ensures that it always counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases, such as when the string is empty or when it contains only one character. In these cases, the program returns 0, which is the correct output.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
