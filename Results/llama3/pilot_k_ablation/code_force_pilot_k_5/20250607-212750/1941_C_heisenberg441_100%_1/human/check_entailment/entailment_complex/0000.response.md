Reasoning:

The given program is designed to count the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make a given string beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map". The program achieves this by counting the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie' in the string.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

- If the string contains 'mapie', it counts it as one occurrence and moves the pointer 5 characters forward.
- If the string contains 'map', it counts it as one occurrence and moves the pointer 3 characters forward.
- If the string contains 'pie', it counts it as one occurrence and moves the pointer 3 characters forward.
- If the string does not contain any of the above substrings, it moves the pointer 1 character forward.

The program correctly returns the total number of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie' in the string, which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
