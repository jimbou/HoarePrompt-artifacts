Reasoning:

The given program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted from a string to make it beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if it does not contain the substrings "pie" or "map".

The program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted. The function uses a while loop to iterate over the characters in the string. It checks for the presence of the substrings "mapie", "map", and "pie" at the current position `i` in the string. If any of these substrings are found, it increments the count `ans` by 1 and moves the position `i` to the end of the matched substring. If none of these substrings are found, it simply moves the position `i` to the next character.

The program then reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates over each test case. For each test case, it reads the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. It then calls the function `func_1(s)` and prints the returned value, which represents the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

The program correctly handles the cases where the string contains multiple occurrences of the substrings "pie" and "map", and it correctly counts the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Correctness: **True**
