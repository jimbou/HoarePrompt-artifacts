Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful. The function `func_1` iterates over the string `s` and checks for the occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie'. If any of these substrings are found, it increments the count `ans` and moves the index `i` to the end of the found substring. If none of these substrings are found, it simply moves the index `i` to the next character. The function returns the total count of non-overlapping occurrences of 'mapie', 'map', and 'pie', which is the minimum number of characters that need to be deleted to make the string beautiful.

Correctness: **True**
