Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of the first element of a, y is the first digit of the first element of a, n is 2 if y is less than or equal to x, otherwise n is 1, c is a list containing the first digit of the first element of a and the last digit of the first element of a if y is less than or equal to x, otherwise c is a list containing the first element of a, i is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.***
