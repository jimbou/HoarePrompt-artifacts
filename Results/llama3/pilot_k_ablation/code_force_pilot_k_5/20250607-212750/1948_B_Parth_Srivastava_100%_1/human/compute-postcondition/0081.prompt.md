Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin, x is 0, y is 0, n is 0, c is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 test cases
Code of the loop:
for i in range(len(a)):
    if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y >= c[n - 1]:
            if y <= x:
                c.append(y)
                c.append(x)
                n = n + 2
            else:
                c.append(a[i])
                n = n + 1
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    elif i == 0 and a[i] > 10:
        x = int(a[i] % 10)
        y = int(a[i] / 10)
        if y <= x:
            c.append(y)
            c.append(x)
            n = n + 2
        else:
            c.append(a[i])
            n = n + 1
    else:
        c.append(a[i])
        n = n + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *`k` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `a` is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 1 element, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0, `y` is the first digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is 0, `n` is either 1 or 2, `c` is a list with at least one element where the last element is either `y` and `x`, `a[i]`, or only `a[i]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases.

Otherwise, `n` is 1 and the last element of `c` is `a[i]`. If `y` is less than `c[n - 1]`, then `n` is 1 and the last element of `c` is `a[i]` and `y` is less than `c[n - 1]`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, then `n` is 1 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `n` is 2 if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `n` is 1, and `c` is a list containing a single element which is the first element of `a` if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the first digit of the first element of `a` and the last digit of the first element of `a` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`.

If `y` is greater than `x`, then `n` is either 2 or 3 and the last element of `c` is `a[i]`. Otherwise, `n` is either 2 or 3, and the last element of `c` is `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, then if `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is either 3 or 4, and the last two elements of `c` are `y` and `x`.

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
