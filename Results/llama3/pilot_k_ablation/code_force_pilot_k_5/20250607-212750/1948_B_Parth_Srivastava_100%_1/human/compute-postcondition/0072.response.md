Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 5 elements, x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, c is a list with at least two elements where the last element is a[i], i is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-2, t-3 or t-4 test cases.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been incremented by 1, and the list `c` has been appended with the value of `a[i]`. The values of `k`, `a`, `x`, `y`, and `i` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in `stdin` has been reduced by 1.
