Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 3 elements, x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], i is greater than or equal to 2, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 3, 4, 5, or 6 and c is a list with at least one element where the last two elements are y and x. Otherwise, n is either 2, 3, 4 or 5 and c is a list with at least two elements where the last element is a[i].***
