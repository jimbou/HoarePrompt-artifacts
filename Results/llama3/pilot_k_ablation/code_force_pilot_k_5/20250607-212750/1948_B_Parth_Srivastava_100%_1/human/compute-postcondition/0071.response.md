Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 5 elements, x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8, c is a list with at least one element where the last element is either y and x, a[i], or only a[i], i is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-1, t-2 or t-3 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10, and c is a list with at least three elements where the last two elements are y and x. Otherwise, n is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, and c is a list with at least two elements where the last element is a[i].***
