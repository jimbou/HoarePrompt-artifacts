Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `a` is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `x` is the last digit of the first element of `a`, `y` is 0 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `y` is the first digit of the first element of `a`, `n` is 1 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `n` is 2 if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `n` is 1, `c` is a list containing a single element which is the first element of `a` if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `c` is a list containing the first digit of the first element of `a` and the last digit of the first element of `a` if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, otherwise `c` is a list containing the first element of `a`, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Either `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0***
