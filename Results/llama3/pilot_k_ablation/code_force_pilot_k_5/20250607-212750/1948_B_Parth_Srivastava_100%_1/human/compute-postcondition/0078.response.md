Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 5 elements, x is the last digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise x is 0 if i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, otherwise x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise y is 0 if i is not 0 or a[i] is less than or equal to 10, otherwise y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, c is a list with at least two elements where the last element is a[i], i is greater than or equal to 4, stdin contains t-1, t-2 or t-3 test cases.**

The code appends the current element of list `a` to list `c` and increments `n` by 1. The value of `n` is now either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, depending on its previous value. The last element of list `c` is now `a[i]`. The values of `k`, `a`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged. The number of test cases in stdin remains the same.
