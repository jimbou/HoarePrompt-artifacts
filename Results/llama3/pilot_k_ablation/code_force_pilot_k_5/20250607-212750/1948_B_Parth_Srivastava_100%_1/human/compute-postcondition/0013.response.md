Postcondition: ***`k` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `a` is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 1 element, `x` is 0, `y` is 0, `n` is 0, `c` is an empty list, `i` is 0, stdin contains t-1 test cases. Either `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0***
