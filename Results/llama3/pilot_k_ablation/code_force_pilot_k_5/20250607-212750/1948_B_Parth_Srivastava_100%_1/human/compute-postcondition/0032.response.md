Output State: **k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 2 elements, x is the last digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 1 or 2, c is a list with at least one element where the last element is either y and x, a[i], or only a[i], i is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases.**

In this output state, the values of `x` and `y` have been updated based on the last digit and first digit of `a[i]`, respectively. The values of `k`, `a`, `n`, `c`, and `i` remain unchanged. The stdin still contains `t-1` test cases.
