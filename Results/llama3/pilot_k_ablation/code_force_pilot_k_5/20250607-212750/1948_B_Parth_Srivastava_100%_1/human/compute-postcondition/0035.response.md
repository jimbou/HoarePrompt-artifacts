Postcondition: **k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 2 elements, x is the last digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 2, 3 or 4, c is a list with at least one element where the last element is either y and x, a[i], or only a[i], i is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 test cases. If y <= x, then n is either 3 or 4, and the last two elements of c are y and x. Otherwise, n is either 2 or 3, and the last element of c is a[i].**
