Postcondition: **`k` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `a` is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the first digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is 0 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `y` is the first digit of `a[i]`, `n` is either 1, 2, 3 or 4, `c` is a list with at least one element where the last element is either `y` and `x`, `a[i]`, or only `a[i]`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1, stdin contains t-1 or t-2 test cases. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is either 3 or 4 and the last two elements of `c` are `y` and `x`. If `y` is greater than `x`, then `n` is either 2 or 3 and the last element of `c` is `a[i]`. Otherwise, `n` is either 2 or 3, and the last element of `c` is `a[i]`. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, then if `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is either 3 or 4, and the last two elements of `c` are `y` and `x`. Otherwise, `n` is either 2 or 3, and the last element of `c` is `a[i]`. If `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, then `n` is either 1 or 2, and the last element of `c` is `a[i]`.**
