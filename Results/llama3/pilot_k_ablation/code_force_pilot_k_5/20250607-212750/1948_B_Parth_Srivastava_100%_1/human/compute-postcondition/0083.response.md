Postcondition: **`k` is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, `a` is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least len(a) elements, `x` is the last digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `x` is 0 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `x` is the last digit of `a[i]`, `y` is the first digit of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, otherwise `y` is 0 if `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, otherwise `y` is the first digit of `a[i]`, `n` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, `c` is a list with at least one element where the last element is either `y` and `x`, `a[i]`, or only `a[i]`, `i` is greater than or equal to len(a) - 1, `d` is a sorted list of `c`, stdin contains t-len(a) test cases. The current value of `c` is equal to the current value of `d`. If `a[i]` is greater than 10 and `i` is greater than 0, then if `y` is greater than or equal to `c[n - 1]`, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is either 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, and `c` is a list with at least three elements where the last two elements are `y` and `x`. Otherwise, `n` is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19, and `c` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is `a[i]`. If `y` is less than `c[n - 1]`, then `n` is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19, `c` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is `a[i]`, and stdin contains t-len(a), t-len(a)-1, t-len(a)-2, t-len(a)-3, t-len(a)-4, t-len(a)-5, t-len(a)-6, t-len(a)-7, t-len(a)-8, t-len(a)-9, t-len(a)-10, t-len(a)-11, t-len(a)-12, t-len(a)-13, t-len(a)-14, t-len(a)-15, t-len(a)-16, t-len(a)-17, t-len(a)-18, or t-len(a)-19 test cases. If `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10 or `i` is 0, then if `i` is 0 and `a[i]` is greater than 10, then if `y` is less than or equal to `x`, `n` is either 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, and `c` is a list with at least three elements where the last two elements are `y` and `x`. Otherwise, `n` is either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19, and `c` is a list with at least two elements where the last element is `a[i]`. If `i` is not 0 or `a[i]` is less than or equal to 10, then `n` is either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, or 19, and `c` is a list with at least one element where the last element is `a[i]`.**
