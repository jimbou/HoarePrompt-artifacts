Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is 0, c is a list with at least one element, i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. The first digit of a[i], y, is greater than or equal to the last element of c, c[n - 1]. Additionally, the first digit of a[i], y, is strictly greater than the last digit of a[i], x.***
