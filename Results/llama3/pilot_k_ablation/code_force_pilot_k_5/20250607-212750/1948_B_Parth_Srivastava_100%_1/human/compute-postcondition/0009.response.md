Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 1 element, x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i], n is either 1 or 2, c is a list with at least two elements where the last element is either y and x or a[i], i is greater than 0 and the current value of i is at least 1, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is 2 and the last two elements of c are y and x. Otherwise, n is 1 and the last element of c is a[i].***
