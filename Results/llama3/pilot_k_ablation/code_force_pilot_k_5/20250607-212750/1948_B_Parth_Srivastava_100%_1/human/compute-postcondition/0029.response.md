Postcondition: ***k is an integer equal to the first input from stdin, a is a list of integers from the second input from stdin that must have at least 2 elements, x is the last digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise x is the last digit of a[i], y is the first digit of a[i] if a[i] is greater than 10 and i is greater than 0, otherwise y is the first digit of a[i]. If y is less than or equal to x, then n is either 3 or 4 and c is a list with at least one element where the last two elements are y and x, stdin contains t-1 test cases. If y is greater than x, then n is either 2 or 3 and c is a list with at least two elements where the last element is a[i], stdin contains t-2 test cases.***
