Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when the first element of the array is less than 10 and the second element is greater than 10. In this case, the program does not correctly check if the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order.

For example, if the input is:

3
4
3 45 67 12

The program will output "NO", but the correct output should be "YES" because the array can be sorted in non-decreasing order by splitting the second element into 4 and 5.

The issue is in the line `if a[i] > 10 and i > 0:` which only checks if the current element is greater than 10 and if it's not the first element. It should also check if the previous element is less than 10.
