Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem of determining whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order by applying the given operation any number of times. The program takes a list of integers as input, modifies the list by splitting two-digit numbers into separate digits if the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit and the first digit is greater than or equal to the last digit in the list, and then checks if the modified list is sorted in ascending order.

The program correctly implements the problem's requirements. It iterates over the input list, checks each element, and applies the operation if necessary. It then checks if the modified list is sorted and appends the result to the output list.

However, there are a few minor issues with the program:

1. The function `func_1()` is defined after it is called in the main part of the program. In Python, functions must be defined before they are called. To fix this, the function definition should be moved above the main part of the program.

2. The variable `c` is used as a list, but it is not initialized as a list. To fix this, `c` should be initialized as an empty list `[]` before the loop.

3. The variable `n` is used to keep track of the length of the list `c`, but it is not necessary. The length of a list in Python can be obtained using the `len()` function.

4. The program uses a list `b` to store the results, but it would be more efficient to print the results directly instead of storing them in a list.

5. The program does not handle invalid inputs. For example, if the input list contains non-integer values, the program will raise an error. To fix this, the program should add error handling to ensure that the input list only contains integers.

Correctness: **False**
