Reasoning: 

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the logic to determine whether it is possible to make a sorted array in non-decreasing order using the given operation. 

The program iterates over each element in the input array. If the element is greater than 10, it checks if the first digit is greater than or equal to the last element in the list `c`. If it is, and the first digit is less than or equal to the second digit, it appends both digits to the list `c`. Otherwise, it appends the original element to the list `c`. If the element is less than or equal to 10, it simply appends the element to the list `c`. 

After processing all elements, it checks if the list `c` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version `d`. If they are equal, it appends 1 to the list `b`, indicating that it is possible to make a sorted array. Otherwise, it appends 0 to the list `b`. 

Finally, it prints 'YES' if the corresponding value in the list `b` is 1, and 'NO' otherwise.

Correctness: **True**
