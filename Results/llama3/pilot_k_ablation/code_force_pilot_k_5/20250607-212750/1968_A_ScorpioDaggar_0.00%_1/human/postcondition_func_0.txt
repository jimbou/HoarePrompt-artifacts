This function reads a number of entries from the user, then for each entry, it reads an integer and calculates the product of the integer divided by its smallest divisor (greater than 1) and the divisor minus 1. The results are then printed out, one per line. If an entry is a prime number (i.e., it has no divisors other than 1 and itself), the function will not calculate a result for that entry and will not print anything for it.
