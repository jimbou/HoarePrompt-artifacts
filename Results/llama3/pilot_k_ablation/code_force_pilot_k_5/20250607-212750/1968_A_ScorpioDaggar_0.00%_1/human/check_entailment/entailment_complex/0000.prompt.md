Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are given an integer x . Your task is to find any integer y (1\le y<x)
such that \gcd(x,y)+y is maximum possible.

Note that if there is more than one y which satisfies the statement, you are
allowed to find any.

\gcd(a,b) is the Greatest Common Divisor of a and b . For example, \gcd(6,4)=2
.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

Each of the following t lines contains a single integer x (2 \le x \le 1000 ).

Output

For each test case, output any y (1 \le y < x ), which satisfies the
statement.

Example

Input

    7
    
    10
    
    7
    
    21
    
    100
    
    2
    
    1000
    
    6

Output

    6
    18
    98

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: stdin contains an integer t (1 <= t <= 1000) followed by t lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000).
    num = int(input('Enter number of entries- '))
    L1 = []
    res = []
    for i in range(num):
        L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))
        
    #State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is `num-1`, `num` must be greater than or equal to 0
    for i in range(num):
        for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
            if L1[i] % j == 0:
                res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
                break
        
    #State: num is an integer between 0 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing num integers plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num.
    print(*res, sep='\n')
    #This is printed: the elements of the list res, separated by newline characters (where res is a list containing num integers plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num integers)

#Overall this is what the function does:This function reads a number of entries from the user, then for each entry, it reads an integer and calculates the product of the integer divided by its smallest divisor (greater than 1) and the divisor minus 1. The results are then printed out, one per line. If an entry is a prime number (i.e., it has no divisors other than 1 and itself), the function will not calculate a result for that entry and will not print anything for it.
