To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `num`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `num` is at least 1. Since `i` is initialized to `num-1`, we need to adjust `i` to be 0, which is the starting value of the range.

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 0, `num` must be greater than or equal to 1**
