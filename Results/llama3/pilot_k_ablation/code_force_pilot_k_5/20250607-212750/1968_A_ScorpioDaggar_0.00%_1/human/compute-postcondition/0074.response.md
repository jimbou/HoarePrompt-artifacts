The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and L1[i], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j and L1[i]. If j is less than L1[i], the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is at least 3, L1[i] is at least 2. For the loop to execute again j must be increased by 1 so j is at least 4 and for the loop to execute again L1[i] must be at least 4.
State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, L1[num] is at least 4, j is at least 4**
