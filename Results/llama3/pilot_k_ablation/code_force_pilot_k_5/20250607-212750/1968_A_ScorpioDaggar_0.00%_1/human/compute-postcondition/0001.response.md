To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variables `i` and `num`. The loop will execute if `num` is at least 1. Since `num` is already an integer between 1 and 1000, we can conclude that `num` must be greater than 0. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is an empty list, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-1 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0**
