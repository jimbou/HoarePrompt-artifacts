To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j`, `L1`, `i`, and `num`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

The state of `L1` and `i` remains unchanged, as they are not modified in the loop head.

The state of `num` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

The state of `res` is not in the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

The state of `stdin` is not relevant to the loop head, so it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is less than `L1[i]` + 1 and `j` is increased by 1, `stdin` contains 0 lines**

Note that I've kept the original state descriptions for `num`, `L1`, `res`, `i`, and `stdin`, as they are not modified in the loop head. Only the state of `j` is adjusted to reflect the increment by 1.
