The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and L1[i]. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `L1[i]`. If `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `L1[i]` is an integer between 2 and 1000. For the loop to execute again `j` is increased by 1 so `j` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer if `L1[i]` is divisible by 2, otherwise `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 3**
