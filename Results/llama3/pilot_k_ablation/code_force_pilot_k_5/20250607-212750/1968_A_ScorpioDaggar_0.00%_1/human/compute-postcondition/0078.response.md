Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, L1[num] is at least 4, j is at least 5, and if L1[i] is divisible by j, res has one additional element which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1).**

The code appends a new element to the list `res` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. The new element is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as `num`, and `j` is still at least 5. The list `L1` and the integer `num` are not modified by the code. The `stdin` remains empty as it was initially.
