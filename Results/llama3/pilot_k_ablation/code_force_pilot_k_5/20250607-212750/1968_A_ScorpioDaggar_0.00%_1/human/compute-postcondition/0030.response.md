To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop head is `for i in range(num):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `num`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000.
- `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer.
- `stdin` contains 0 lines.
- `i` is equal to `num`.
- `j` is equal to `L1[i] + 1`.
- `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`.

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the given state: `L1[i]` cannot be greater than or equal to `L1[i] + 1` because adding 1 to any number will always result in a larger number. This statement appears to be an error in the problem description.

To proceed with the task, we'll ignore the contradictory statement and focus on the loop head variables, which are `i` and `num`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `num`. Since `i` is currently equal to `num`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and `num` must be greater than its current value to satisfy the loop condition.

However, since `i` is already equal to `num`, and we are considering the next iteration, it indicates we are actually looking at the condition for the loop to potentially execute again after the current state. Given `i` is already at `num`, the loop would not execute again unless `num` changes. But since we can only adjust states of objects in the loop head, and `num` is not directly adjustable in this context (as it's the range limit), the description seems to lead to a misunderstanding.

Given the constraints and focusing strictly on the loop head variables (`i` and `num`), and acknowledging the confusion in the problem statement, the logical adjustment for the loop to potentially execute again (considering the increment of `i` and the necessity for `num` to be greater than `i` for another iteration) would be:

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `j` is not directly relevant to the loop head's state adjustment, `L1[i]` comparison is not relevant to the loop head's state adjustment.**

However, please note, the adjustment of `i` to `num + 1` is based on the logic of incrementing `i` for the next iteration, but given `i` is already at `num`, and without changing `num`, the loop wouldn't execute again. The problem statement's logic and the task's requirement seem to be at odds, leading to a confusing scenario for state adjustment.
