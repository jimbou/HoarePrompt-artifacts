Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 3**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The list `L1` also remains unchanged, as no operations are performed on it. The list `res` is appended with a new integer value, which is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The value of `j` remains unchanged, as it is not modified by the code. The `stdin` remains empty, as no input operations are performed.
