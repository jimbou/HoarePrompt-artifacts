Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] must be greater than or equal to L1[i], j is L1[i] + 1.**

The loop will execute until `j` is greater than `L1[i]`. After the loop finishes executing, `j` will be equal to `L1[i] + 1`, and `L1[i]` will be greater than or equal to itself. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.
