The code prints the elements of the list `res`, separated by newline characters.

The list `res` contains `num` integers, where `num` is an integer between 0 and 1000. For each integer `L1[i]` in the list `L1`, if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, the corresponding element in `res` is `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, otherwise the element in `res` is just `L1[i]`.

Since the exact values of `num`, `L1`, and `res` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical values of the elements in `res`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the elements of `res`, separated by newline characters.

Output: **the elements of the list res, separated by newline characters (where res is a list containing num integers plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num integers)**
