Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, j is equal to L1[i] + 1, L1[i] is greater than or equal to L1[i] + 1.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that `num` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` remains a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num`, `j` is equal to `L1[i] + 1`, and `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to `L1[i] + 1`. This means that the loop has iterated over all elements in `L1` and has appended the result of the division of each element by its smallest divisor to the `res` list. The loop has also incremented `i` to `num` and `j` to `L1[i] + 1`.
