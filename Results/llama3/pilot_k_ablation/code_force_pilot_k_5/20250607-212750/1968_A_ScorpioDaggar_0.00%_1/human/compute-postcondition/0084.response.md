To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which in this case is only the variable `i` and `num`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `num`, so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `num`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, we can conclude that `i` must be equal to `num + 1` for the loop to execute again. However, since `i` cannot exceed `num` for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `num` to be greater than `i`. Therefore, `num` must be greater than `num`.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least `L1[i]`, `j` is `L1[i]` + 1, `num` must be greater than `num`**
