Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] must be greater than 1, j is 3, stdin contains 0 lines**

The code appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the `res` list. Since `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` is an integer between 2 and 1000. The value of `j` is 3. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are affected.
