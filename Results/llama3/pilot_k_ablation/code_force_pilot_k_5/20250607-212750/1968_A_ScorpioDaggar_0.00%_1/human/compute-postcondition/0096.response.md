Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least 5, j is 5**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Since `L1[i]` is at least 5 and `j` is 5, `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` will be a non-negative integer. The second line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

After executing the code, the value of `res` is updated by appending the calculated value. The other variables remain unchanged. The final state includes all the information from the precondition that remains valid after the code execution, with the updated value of `res`.
