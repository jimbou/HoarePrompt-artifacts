To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The objects involved are `j`, `L1`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1.

The state of `L1` and `i` remains unchanged, as they are not modified in the loop head.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `i` is less than `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is less than `L1[i]`, `stdin` contains 0 lines. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1), otherwise `res` remains unchanged.**
