Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is an empty list, res is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000).**

The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `num`. Since `num` is between 1 and 1000, it is now a specific integer within this range. The second line initializes `L1` as an empty list. The third line initializes `res` as an empty list. No other variables are affected. Stdin now contains t-1 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000) because one line has been read to assign a value to `num`.
