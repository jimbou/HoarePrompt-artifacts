The only variables in the loop head are variables `i` and `num`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `num` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `num` must be greater than 1.
State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing one integer between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-2 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 1, `num` must be greater than 1**
