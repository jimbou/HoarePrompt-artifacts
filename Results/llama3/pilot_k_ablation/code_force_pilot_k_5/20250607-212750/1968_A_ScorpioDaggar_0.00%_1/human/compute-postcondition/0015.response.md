Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is 0, j is 2.**

The code appends the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`, and then breaks out of the loop. Since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, the expression evaluates to an integer. The value of `res` is now a list containing this integer. The values of `num`, `L1`, `stdin`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged.
