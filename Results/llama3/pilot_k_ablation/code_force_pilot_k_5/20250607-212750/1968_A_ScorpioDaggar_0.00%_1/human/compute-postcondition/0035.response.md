The only objects in the loop head are variables  j and L1[i], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable j. If j is less than L1[i] + 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, j is less than L1[i] + 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time j is increased by 1 and must be less than L1[i] + 1.
State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is less than L1[i] + 1**
