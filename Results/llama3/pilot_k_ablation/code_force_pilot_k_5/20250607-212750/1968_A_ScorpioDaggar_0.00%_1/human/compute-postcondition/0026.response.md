To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `j`, `L1`, `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 5, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 5.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 6. Since `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 5, it must be greater than or equal to 6 for the loop to execute again.

The other variables `num`, `res`, `stdin` are not involved in the loop head, so their states remain the same.

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 0, `j` is 6, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 6**
