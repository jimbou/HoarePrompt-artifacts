To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of the objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, and `L1[i]` must be greater than 1.

To execute the loop again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 4. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 4, since `j` is now 4.

The other variables, `num`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i`, are not part of the loop head and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num` + 1, `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 4, `j` is 4**
