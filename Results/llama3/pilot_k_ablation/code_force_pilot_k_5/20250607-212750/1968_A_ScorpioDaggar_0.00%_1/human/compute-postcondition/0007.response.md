The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and num, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `num` is greater than 2. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 3 and for the loop to execute again num must be greater than 3.
State: **`num` is an integer between 4 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing three integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-4 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 3, `num` must be greater than 3**
