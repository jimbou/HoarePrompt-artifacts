Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is greater than 1, j is 2.**

Explanation:
The first line appends the value of L1[i] // j * (j - 1) to the list res. Since L1[i] is divisible by j (i.e., L1[i] % j == 0), the expression L1[i] // j * (j - 1) evaluates to a valid integer value. The second line breaks out of the loop, but since there are no more lines to execute, the program terminates.

The initial state remains mostly unchanged, with the exception of the list res, which now contains an additional integer value. The value of i, j, and L1[i] remains the same, as they are not modified by the code. The stdin remains empty, as it was initially.
