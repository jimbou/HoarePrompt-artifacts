Output State: **`num` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing three integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-4 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 2, `num` must be greater than 2**

In this output state, the value of `L1` has been updated to include a new integer between 2 and 1000, which was input by the user. The value of `i` remains the same, and the other variables (`num`, `res`, and `stdin`) are unchanged. The condition that `num` must be greater than 2 is still valid.
