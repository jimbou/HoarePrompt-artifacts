Output State: **num is an integer between 0 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing num integers plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `num` is an integer between 0 and 1000, the list `L1` contains `num` integers between 2 and 1000, the list `res` contains `num` integers plus the result of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` contains `num` integers, the standard input `stdin` contains 0 lines, and the variable `i` is equal to `num`. This means that the loop has iterated over all elements in the list `L1` and has appended the result of the calculation to the list `res` for each element.
