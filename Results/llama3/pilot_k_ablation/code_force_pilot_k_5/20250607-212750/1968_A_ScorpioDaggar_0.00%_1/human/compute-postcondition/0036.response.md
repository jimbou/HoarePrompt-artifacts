Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is less than L1[i] + 1, stdin contains 0 lines**

The code snippet appends a new element to the `res` list, which is the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. This expression is evaluated using the current values of `L1[i]` and `j`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of the variables.

Note that the value of `res` is updated by appending a new element to the list, but the length of the list is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the final state of `res` is described as "a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1)", indicating that the list has been extended by one element.

All other variables, including `num`, `L1`, `i`, `L1[i]`, `j`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged by the code snippet.
