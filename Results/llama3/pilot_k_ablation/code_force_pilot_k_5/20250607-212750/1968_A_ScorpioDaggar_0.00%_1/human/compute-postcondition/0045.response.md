Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is less than L1[i] and greater than or equal to 3, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines.**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `L1` also remains unchanged as no operations are performed on it. The value of `i` remains less than `num` as it is not modified. The value of `L1[i]` remains at least 2 as it is not modified. The value of `j` remains less than `L1[i]` and greater than or equal to 3 as it is not modified. The list `res` now contains one additional integer which is the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The `stdin` remains empty as no input operations are performed.
