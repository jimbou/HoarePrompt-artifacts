Output State: **`num` is an integer between 5 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing five integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-6 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 4, `num` must be greater than 4**

In this output state, the value of `L1` has been updated to include a new integer between 2 and 1000, which was input by the user. The value of `stdin` has been updated to reflect that one line of input has been consumed. The values of `num`, `res`, and `i` remain unchanged.
