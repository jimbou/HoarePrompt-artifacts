Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] must be greater than or equal to 4, j is 4**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged, still an integer between 2 and 1001. The list `L1` also remains unchanged, containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000. The list `res` has been appended with the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, where `i` is equal to `num + 1` and `j` is 4. The stdin remains empty, containing 0 lines. The value of `i` remains equal to `num + 1`, and the value of `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 4. The value of `j` remains 4.
