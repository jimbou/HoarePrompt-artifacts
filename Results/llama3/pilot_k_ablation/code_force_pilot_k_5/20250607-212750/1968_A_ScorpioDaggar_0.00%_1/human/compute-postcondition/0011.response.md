Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is `num-1`, `num` must be greater than or equal to 0**

In natural language, this output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the variable `num` still holds its initial value between 1 and 1000. The list `L1` has been populated with `num` integers, each between 2 and 1000, which were input by the user during each iteration of the loop. The list `res` remains empty as it was not modified within the loop. The standard input `stdin` is now empty since all input lines have been consumed by the loop. The loop variable `i` has reached the value of `num-1`, indicating that the loop has executed `num` times. The condition on `num` being greater than or equal to 0 is a consequence of the loop executing at least once, but since `num` is defined to be between 1 and 1000, it will always be greater than 0.
