Postcondition: ***num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] must be greater than 6, j is 6. If L1[i] is divisible by j, res has one more element appended to it which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1).***
