To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The objects involved are `j` and `L1[i]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is at least 5, and `L1[i]` is at least 4.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `L1[i] + 1`. Since `j` is at least 5, we can increment it by 1 to make it 6. Similarly, `L1[i]` must be at least 5 to satisfy the condition `j < L1[i] + 1`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:

* `j` is 6
* `L1[i]` is at least 5

The other variables, `num`, `L1`, `res`, `stdin`, and `i`, are not affected by the loop head and remain unchanged.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 5, `j` is 6**
