To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and `L1[i]`. If `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is less than `L1[i]`, `L1[i]` is at least 2, and `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1.

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `i` is less than `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is less than `L1[i]` and greater than or equal to 3, `stdin` contains 0 lines. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1), otherwise `res` remains unchanged.**
