To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `j`, `L1`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 4, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is equal to `num + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 5. Since `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 4, it must be greater than or equal to 5 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `num`, `L1` (except for `L1[i]`), `res`, and `stdin` remains unchanged, as they are not involved in the loop head.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 5, `j` is 5**
