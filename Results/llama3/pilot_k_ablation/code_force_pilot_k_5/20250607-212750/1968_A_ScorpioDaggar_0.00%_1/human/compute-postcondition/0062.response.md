The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and L1[i], so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `L1[i]`. If `j` is less than `L1[i]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 5, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 5. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 6 and for the loop to execute again `L1[i]` must be greater than 6.
State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] must be greater than 6, j is 6. If L1[i] is divisible by j, res has one more element appended to it which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1).**
