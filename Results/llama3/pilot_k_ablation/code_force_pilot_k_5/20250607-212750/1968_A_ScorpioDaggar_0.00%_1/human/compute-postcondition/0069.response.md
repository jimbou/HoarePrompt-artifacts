Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, L1[num] is at least 2, j is at least 2.**

The code appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the `res` list, since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`. The `break` statement does not affect any variables. No other variables are modified.
