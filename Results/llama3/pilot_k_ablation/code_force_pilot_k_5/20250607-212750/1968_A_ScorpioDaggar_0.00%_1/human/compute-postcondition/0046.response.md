Postcondition: ***num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is less than L1[i] and greater than or equal to 3, stdin contains 0 lines. If L1[i] is divisible by j, then res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), otherwise res remains unchanged.***
