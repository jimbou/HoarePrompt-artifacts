Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is an empty list, res is an empty list, stdin contains t-1 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000).
Code of the loop:
for i in range(num):
    L1.append(int(input('Enter entry no.' + str(i + 1) + '- ')))


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing one integer between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-2 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `num` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing two integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-3 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 1, `num` must be greater than 1

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `num` is an integer between 3 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing three integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-4 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 2, `num` must be greater than 2

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `num` is an integer between 4 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing four integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-5 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 3, `num` must be greater than 3

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `num` is an integer between 5 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing five integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-6 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 4, `num` must be greater than 4




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
