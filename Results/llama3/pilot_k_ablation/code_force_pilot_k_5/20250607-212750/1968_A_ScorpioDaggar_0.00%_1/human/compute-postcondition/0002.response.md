Output State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing one integer between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains t-2 lines each containing an integer x (2 <= x <= 1000), `i` is 0, `num` must be greater than 0**

In this output state, the value of `L1` has been updated to include one integer between 2 and 1000, which was entered by the user as input. The value of `i` remains the same, which is 0. The values of `num`, `res`, and `stdin` remain unchanged. The condition that `num` must be greater than 0 is still valid.
