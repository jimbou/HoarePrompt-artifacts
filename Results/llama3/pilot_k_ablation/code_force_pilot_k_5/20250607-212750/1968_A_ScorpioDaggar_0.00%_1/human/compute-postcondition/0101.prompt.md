Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least `L1[i]`, `j` is `L1[i]` + 1, `num` must be greater than `num`
Code of the loop:
for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
    if L1[i] % j == 0:
        res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 2

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 3

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least 4, j is 4

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least 5, j is 5

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least 6, `j` is 6. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is updated with the new value, otherwise it remains unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
