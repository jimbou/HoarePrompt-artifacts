Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] must be greater than or equal to 5, j is 5, res has one more element appended to it which is L1[i] // j * (j - 1).**

In this output state, the value of `num` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. The list `L1` also remains the same as no changes are made to it. The list `res` has one more element appended to it, which is the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`. The value of `stdin` remains the same as it is not used in the code. The value of `i` remains the same as it is not modified by the code. The value of `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 5 as specified in the precondition. The value of `j` remains the same as it is not modified by the code.
