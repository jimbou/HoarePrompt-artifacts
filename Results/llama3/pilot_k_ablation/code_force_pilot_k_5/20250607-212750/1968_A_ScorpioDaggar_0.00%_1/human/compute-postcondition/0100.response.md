Postcondition: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least 6, `j` is 6. If `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, then `res` is updated with the new value, otherwise it remains unchanged.**
