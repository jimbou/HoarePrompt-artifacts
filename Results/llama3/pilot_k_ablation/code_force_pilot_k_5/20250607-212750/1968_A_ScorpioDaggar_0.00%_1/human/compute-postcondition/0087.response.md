Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least 2, j is 2.**

The code snippet consists of two lines. The first line appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j` (i.e., `L1[i] % j` equals 0), this expression evaluates to an integer. The second line breaks out of the loop, but since there is no loop in the provided code snippet, this line has no effect.

The initial state of `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged. Since `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` is appended to `res`. The value of `i` is `num + 1`, and `L1[i]` is at least 2. The value of `j` is 2.

The final state of the variables is as follows:

* `num` remains an integer between 2 and 1001.
* `L1` remains a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000.
* `res` is updated to contain one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`.
* `stdin` remains empty, containing 0 lines.
* `i` remains equal to `num + 1`.
* `L1[i]` remains at least 2.
* `j` remains equal to 2.

Note that the value of `L1[i]` is not modified by the code, and the value of `res` is updated by appending a new value to the list.
