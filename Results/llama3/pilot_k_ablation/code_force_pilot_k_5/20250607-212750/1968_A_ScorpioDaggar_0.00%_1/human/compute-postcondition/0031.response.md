To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop will execute if `L1[i]` is at least 2, because the range starts from 2.
2. Since `i` is equal to `num + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be within the bounds of the list `L1`. This means `i` should be less than `num`, because list indices in Python start from 0.
3. The value of `j` is not directly relevant to the loop head's state adjustment, but we know it will start from 2.

Considering these points, we can adjust the states as follows:

* `i` should be less than `num` to ensure it's within the bounds of the list `L1`.
* `L1[i]` should be at least 2 to ensure the loop executes.
* `j` will start from 2, but its initial value is not relevant to the loop head's state adjustment.

The other variables (`num`, `L1`, `res`, `stdin`) are not directly relevant to the loop head's state adjustment.

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is less than `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 2**
