The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and L1[i]. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables L1[i]. If L1[i] is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, j is not directly relevant to the loop head's state adjustment, L1[i] comparison is not relevant to the loop head's state adjustment does not ensure that the loop will execute , so it needs to be adjusted to L1[i] is greater than 1 and j is now 2.
State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num` + 1, `L1[i]` must be greater than 1, `j` is 2**
