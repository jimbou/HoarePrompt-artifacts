To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `L1[i]`. If `L1[i]` is at least 2, the loop can execute.

State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 0, `num` must be greater than or equal to 1, `L1[i]` must be at least 2, `j` is 2**
