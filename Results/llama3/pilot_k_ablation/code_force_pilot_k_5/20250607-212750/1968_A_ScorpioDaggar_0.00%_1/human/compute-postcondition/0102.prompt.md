Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is an empty list, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is `num-1`, `num` must be greater than or equal to 0
Code of the loop:
for i in range(num):
    for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):
        if L1[i] % j == 0:
            res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))
            break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, j is equal to L1[i] + 1, L1[i] is greater than or equal to L1[i] + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, j is not directly relevant to the loop head's state adjustment, L1[i] comparison is not relevant to the loop head's state adjustment.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] must be greater than or equal to L1[i], j is L1[i] + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, L1[i] is at least L1[i], j is L1[i] + 1

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num + 1, L1[i] is at least L1[i], j is L1[i] + 1




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
