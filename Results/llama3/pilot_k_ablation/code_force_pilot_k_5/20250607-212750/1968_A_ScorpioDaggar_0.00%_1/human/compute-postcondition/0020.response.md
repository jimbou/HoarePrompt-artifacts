The only variables in the loop head are variables  j and L1, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `L1[i]`. If `j` is less than `L1[i] + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 3, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute again `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 4 and for the loop to execute again `L1[i]` must be greater than or equal to 4.
State: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing two integers if `L1[i]` is divisible by 3, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is 0, `j` is 4, `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 4**
