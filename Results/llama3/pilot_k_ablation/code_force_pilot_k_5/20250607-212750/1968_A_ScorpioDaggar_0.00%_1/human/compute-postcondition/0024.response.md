Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is 0, j is 5, L1[i] is greater than or equal to 5**

The code snippet appends the value of `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res` and then breaks out of the loop. Since `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 5 and `j` is 5, the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` will be an integer. The value of `res` is updated by appending this integer to the list. The other variables remain unchanged.
