Postcondition: ***num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, j is less than L1[i] + 1, stdin contains 0 lines***
