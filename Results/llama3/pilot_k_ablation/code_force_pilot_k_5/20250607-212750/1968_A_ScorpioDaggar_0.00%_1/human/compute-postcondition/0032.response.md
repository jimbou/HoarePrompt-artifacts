Postcondition: **`num` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is less than `num`, `L1[i]` is at least 2, and the current value of `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`.**
