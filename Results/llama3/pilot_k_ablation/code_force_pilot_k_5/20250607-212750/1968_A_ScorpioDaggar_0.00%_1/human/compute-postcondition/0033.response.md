Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is less than num, L1[i] is at least 2, and the current value of L1[i] is divisible by j.**

The code snippet appends a new value to the `res` list, which is calculated as `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, and then breaks out of the loop. The value of `L1[i]` is at least 2 and is divisible by `j`, so the calculation will result in a non-negative integer. The `res` list now contains one more integer than before, and its length is increased by 1. The other variables, `num`, `L1`, `stdin`, and `i`, remain unchanged.
