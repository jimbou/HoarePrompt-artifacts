Output State: **num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1), stdin contains 0 lines, i is 0, j is 6, L1[i] is greater than or equal to 6**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `res.append(L1[i] // j * (j - 1))` and `break`. The first line appends the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` to the list `res`. Since `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 6 and `j` is 6, the expression evaluates to a non-negative integer. The second line, `break`, does not affect any variables.

After executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `num` remains an integer between 1 and 1000, as it is not modified by the code.
* `L1` remains a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, as it is not modified by the code.
* `res` is now a list containing one integer plus the result of the expression `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)`, which is a non-negative integer.
* `stdin` remains empty, containing 0 lines, as it is not modified by the code.
* `i` remains 0, as it is not modified by the code.
* `j` remains 6, as it is not modified by the code.
* `L1[i]` remains greater than or equal to 6, as it is not modified by the code.

Note that the value of `res` is updated by appending a new element to the list, but the length of the list is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state only describes the updated value of `res` without specifying its length.
