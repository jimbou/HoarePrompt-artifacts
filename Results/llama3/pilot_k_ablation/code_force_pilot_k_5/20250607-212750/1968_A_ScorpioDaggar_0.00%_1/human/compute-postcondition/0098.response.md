To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`. The objects involved are `j`, `L1`, and `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 5, `L1[i]` is at least 5, and `i` is equal to `num + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 6. Since `L1[i]` is at least 5, the loop can execute again as long as `L1[i]` is greater than or equal to 6.

The state of `i` remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop head.

The state of `num` is not modified in the loop head, so it remains an integer between 2 and 1001.

The state of `L1` is not modified in the loop head, so it remains a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000.

The state of `res` is not modified in the loop head, so it remains a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise it remains unchanged.

The state of `stdin` is not modified in the loop head, so it remains containing 0 lines.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise it remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least 6, `j` is 6**
