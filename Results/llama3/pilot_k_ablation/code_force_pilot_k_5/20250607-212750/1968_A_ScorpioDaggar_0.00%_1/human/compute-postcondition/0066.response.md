To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in range(num):`. The only objects in the loop head are `i` and `num`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `num + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `num`. Therefore, we need to adjust the value of `i` to be `num`.

The value of `num` remains the same, as it is not modified by the loop.

The other variables, `L1`, `res`, `stdin`, and `j`, are not part of the loop head and therefore their states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num`, `j` is `L1[i] + 1**
