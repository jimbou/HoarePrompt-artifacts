Output: **num is an integer between 0 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing num integers plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing num integers, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, and the elements of the list res are printed, each on a new line, where each element of res is either an integer between 2 and 1000, or an integer between 2 and 1000 plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j**
