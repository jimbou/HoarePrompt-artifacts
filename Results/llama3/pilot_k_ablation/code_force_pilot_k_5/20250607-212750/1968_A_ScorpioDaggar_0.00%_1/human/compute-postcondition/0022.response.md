Postcondition: ***num is an integer between 1 and 1000, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing two integers if L1[i] is divisible by 3, otherwise res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res is a list containing one integer, stdin contains 0 lines, i is 0, j is 4, L1[i] is greater than or equal to 4***
