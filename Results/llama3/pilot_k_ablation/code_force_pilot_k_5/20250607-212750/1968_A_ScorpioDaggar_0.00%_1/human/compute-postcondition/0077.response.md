To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`.

From the given state, we know that `j` is at least 4, and `L1[i]` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, and `L1[i]` must remain the same.

The adjusted state is:

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is at least 4, `j` is at least 5, and if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, `res` has one additional element which is `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1).**

Note that we only adjusted the state of `j`, which is the only variable in the loop head that needs to be updated for the loop to execute again.
