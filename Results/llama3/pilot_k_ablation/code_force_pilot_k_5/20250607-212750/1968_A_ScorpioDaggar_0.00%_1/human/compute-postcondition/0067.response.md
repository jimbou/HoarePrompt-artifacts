To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `j` and `L1[i]`. According to the code, the loop will execute if `L1[i]` is at least 2 (since the range starts from 2). Also, `j` should be within the range of 2 to `L1[i] + 1`. Since `i` is equal to `num`, we can replace `L1[i]` with `L1[num]`. Additionally, `j` should be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i] // j * (j - 1)` if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num`, `L1[num]` is at least 2, `j` is at least 2**
