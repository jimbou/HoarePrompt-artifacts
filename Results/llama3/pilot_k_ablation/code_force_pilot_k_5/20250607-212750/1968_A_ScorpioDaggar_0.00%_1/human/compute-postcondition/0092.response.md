To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is: `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`

The objects involved in the loop head are `j`, `L1`, and `i`.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `L1[i]`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 3, `L1[i]` is at least 2, and `i` is equal to `num + 1`.

For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 4. Since `L1[i]` is at least 2, it must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.

The state of `num`, `L1` (except for `L1[i]`), `res`, and `stdin` does not affect the loop execution, so they remain unchanged.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num + 1`, `L1[i]` is at least 4, `j` is 4**
