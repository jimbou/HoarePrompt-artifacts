Output State: **num is an integer between 2 and 1001, L1 is a list containing num integers between 2 and 1000, res is a list containing one integer plus L1[i] // j * (j - 1) if L1[i] is divisible by j, otherwise res remains unchanged, stdin contains 0 lines, i is equal to num, L1[i] is at least L1[i], j is L1[i] + 1**

This output state means that after the loop has executed all its iterations, the value of `num` remains unchanged, `L1` still contains `num` integers between 2 and 1000, and `res` has been updated to include the results of the loop's calculations for each `L1[i]`. The value of `i` remains equal to `num`, and `j` has reached its maximum value of `L1[i] + 1`. The state of `stdin` remains unchanged, containing 0 lines.
