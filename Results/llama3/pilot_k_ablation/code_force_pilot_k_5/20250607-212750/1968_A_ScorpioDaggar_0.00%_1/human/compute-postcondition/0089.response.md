To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to adjust the variables in the loop head according to the loop condition. The loop head is `for j in range(2, L1[i] + 1):`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 2, and `L1[i]` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `L1[i] + 1`. Since `j` is currently 2, we need to increment it by 1 to make it 3.

The state of `num`, `L1`, `res`, and `stdin` remains unchanged, as they are not part of the loop head.

The updated state is:

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num` + 1, `L1[i]` is at least 2, `j` is 3**
