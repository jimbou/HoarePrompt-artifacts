To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head. The loop head is `for i in range(num):`, so we can only adjust the states of `i` and `num`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `num`. If `i` is less than `num`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `num`, which means the loop has already executed `num` times.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes `num + 1`. However, this would mean that `i` is no longer less than `num`, so the loop would not execute again.

Therefore, the only way for the loop to execute one more time is if `num` is increased by 1, so `num` becomes `num + 1`. This would allow `i` to be incremented by 1 and still be less than `num`, allowing the loop to execute again.

State: **`num` is an integer between 2 and 1001, `L1` is a list containing `num` integers between 2 and 1000, `res` is a list containing one integer plus `L1[i]` // `j` * (`j` - 1) if `L1[i]` is divisible by `j`, otherwise `res` is a list containing one integer, `stdin` contains 0 lines, `i` is equal to `num` + 1, `j` is not directly relevant to the loop head's state adjustment, `L1[i]` comparison is not relevant to the loop head's state adjustment**
