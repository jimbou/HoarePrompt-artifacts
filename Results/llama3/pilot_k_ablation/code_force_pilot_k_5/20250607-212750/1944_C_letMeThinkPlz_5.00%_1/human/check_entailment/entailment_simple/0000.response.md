Reasoning:

The given program is correct. Here's why:

1.  The program correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
2.  It creates a counter dictionary to store the frequency of each element in the array.
3.  It then iterates over the range of possible MEX values (from 0 to n) and checks if the current value is present in the counter dictionary.
4.  If the current value is not present in the counter dictionary, it means that the current value is the MEX, and the program prints it.
5.  If the current value is present in the counter dictionary but its frequency is 1 and the `once` flag is not set, it means that the current value is the only occurrence of this value in the array, and the program sets the `once` flag to True and updates the answer to be the next value.
6.  If the current value is present in the counter dictionary and its frequency is greater than 1, or if the `once` flag is already set, the program continues to the next value.
7.  The program correctly handles the case where the MEX is the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list.

The program's logic is correct, and it should produce the expected output for the given problem.

Correctness: **True**
