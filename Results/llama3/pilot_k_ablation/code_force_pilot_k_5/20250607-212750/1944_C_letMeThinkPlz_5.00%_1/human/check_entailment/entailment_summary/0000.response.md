Reasoning:

The given program is correct. It correctly implements the strategy for Alice to maximize the score and Bob to minimize the score in the game.

The program uses a dictionary `counter` to count the occurrences of each number in the input array `arr`. It then iterates over the range of numbers from 0 to `n-1` and checks if the current number is not present in the array or appears only once in the array. If it finds such a number, it sets `ans` to that number and breaks the loop.

The program correctly handles the case where the input array contains all numbers from 0 to `n-1` by setting `ans` to `n` in that case.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input array contains a number that appears only once and is greater than the last element in the array by setting `ans` to that number plus one in that case.

The program's time complexity is O(n) and its space complexity is also O(n), which is efficient for the given constraints.

Correctness: **True**
