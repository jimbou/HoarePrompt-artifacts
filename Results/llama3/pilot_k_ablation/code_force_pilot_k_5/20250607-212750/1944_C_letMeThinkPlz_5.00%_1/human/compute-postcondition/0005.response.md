The only objects in the loop head are variables  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr.  If the list has at least 2 integers the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 integer, i is the first integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 integers and the i is the second integer in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` is empty**
