Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 1, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the first element in the list `arr` plus `n` if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the first element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is True if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1, otherwise `once` is False, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the value of `counter` has been updated to include the count of `i`, which is now 1. The values of `ans` and `once` have also been updated based on the count of `i` in `counter`. The other variables remain unchanged.
