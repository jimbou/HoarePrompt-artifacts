Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 2, ans is i + 2**

The code snippet assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, and then breaks out of the loop. Since `i` is `i + 2`, `ans` becomes `i + 2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
