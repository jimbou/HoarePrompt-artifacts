The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list  arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 3 elements the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 2 elements, i is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the i is the third element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1 and the count of the third element in `arr` is the current count of the third element in `arr` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the third element in the list.**
