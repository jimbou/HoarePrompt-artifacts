Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, `ans` is 0, `once` is False, and `stdin` is empty. The current value of `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, meaning that the count of the integer `i` in the original list is 0.**
