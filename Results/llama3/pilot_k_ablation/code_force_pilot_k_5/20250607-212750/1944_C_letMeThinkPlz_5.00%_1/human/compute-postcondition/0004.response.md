The code updates the value of `counter[i]` by incrementing it by 1. Since `counter` is an empty dictionary initially, `counter.get(i, 0)` will return 0 if `i` is not already a key in the dictionary. Therefore, `counter[i]` will be set to 1.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 1 as its value, `stdin` is empty**
