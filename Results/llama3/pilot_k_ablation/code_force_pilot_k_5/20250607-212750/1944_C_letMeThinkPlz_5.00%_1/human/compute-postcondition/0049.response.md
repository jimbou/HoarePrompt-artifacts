The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `i` is the last integer in the original list, which does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `i` is the first integer in the list `arr`. Also, `arr` must have at least 1 integer.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first integer in the list `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty**
