Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 4, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of each element in arr is the current count of the element in arr plus the number of times the element appears in arr, stdin is empty, i is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) equals 0, then ans is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) equals 1 and once is False, then ans is 4 and once is True. Otherwise, the values of ans and once remain unchanged.***
