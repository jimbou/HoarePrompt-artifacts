The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `i + 1` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, `stdin` is empty. If the count of `i + 1` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is `True`. If the count of `i + 1` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is `i + 2` and `once` is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
