Output State: `t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is `t`, `i` is the last element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the last element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is False, stdin is empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the variable `t` remains an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), the variable `_` remains 2, the variable `n` remains an integer, the list `arr` must have at least `t` elements, the dictionary `counter` will have a count of `t` for the last element `i` in the list `arr`, the variable `i` will be the last element in the list `arr`, the variable `ans` will be the last element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, the variable `once` will be False, and the stdin will remain empty.
