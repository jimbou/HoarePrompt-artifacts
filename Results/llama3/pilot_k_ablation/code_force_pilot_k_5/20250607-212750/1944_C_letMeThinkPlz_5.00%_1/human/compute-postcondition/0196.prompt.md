Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 4, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to t, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty, ans is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, once is True, i is the last element in the list, and ans is printed
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the first element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1 and the count of the third element in `arr` is the current count of the third element in `arr` plus 2, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the third element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1 and the count of the third element in `arr` is the current count of the third element in `arr` plus 2 and the count of the fourth element in `arr` is the current count of the fourth element in `arr` plus 4, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the fourth element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1 and the count of the third element in `arr` is the current count of the third element in `arr` plus 2 and the count of the fourth element in `arr` is the current count of the fourth element in `arr` plus 4 and the count of the fifth element in `arr` is the current count of the fifth element in `arr` plus 9, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the fifth element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
