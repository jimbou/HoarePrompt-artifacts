To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If `arr` has at least one more integer, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least one more integer, and `i` must be the next integer in the list `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the second integer in the list `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty**
