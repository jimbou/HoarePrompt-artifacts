Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 1, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, once is True, ans is i + 1.**

The code snippet consists of three lines. The first line sets the value of `once` to `True`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to `ans`. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect the state of any variables.

The initial state provides the following information: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, and `stdin` is empty. The state of `ans` and `once` depends on the count of `i + 1` in `counter`. If the count is 0, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is `True`. If the count is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is `i + 2` and `once` is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

Since the code sets `once` to `True` and `ans` to `i + 1`, the final state of these variables is `once` is `True` and `ans` is `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.
