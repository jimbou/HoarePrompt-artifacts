The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is `i + 2` and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 2**
