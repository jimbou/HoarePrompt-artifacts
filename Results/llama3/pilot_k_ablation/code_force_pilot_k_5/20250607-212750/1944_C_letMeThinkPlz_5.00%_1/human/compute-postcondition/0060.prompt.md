Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, i is the last integer in the original list, ans is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, once is True, and stdin is empty
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the first integer in the list `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 2 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the second integer in the list `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list `arr`, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 3 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, and `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `arr`, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, and `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 integers, `i` is the fifth integer in the list `arr`, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 5 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, and `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
