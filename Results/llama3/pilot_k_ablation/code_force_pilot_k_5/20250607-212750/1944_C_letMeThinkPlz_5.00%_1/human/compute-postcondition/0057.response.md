To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 5 integers, the loop can execute again for the fifth time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `arr`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 5 integers and `i` is the fifth integer in the list `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 integers, `i` is the fifth integer in the list `arr`, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, and `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty**
