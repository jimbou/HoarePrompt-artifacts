Output State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, i is the last integer in the list arr plus n - 1, stdin is empty, ans is the last integer in the list arr plus n - 1 if the count of i in counter is 0, otherwise ans is the last integer in the list arr plus n, once is False if the count of i in counter is 0, otherwise once is True.**

In this output state, the value of `n` has been updated to the integer value of the input. The list `arr` now contains the integers from the input. The dictionary `counter` is empty. The value of `i` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`. The state of `stdin` remains empty. The value of `ans` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1` if the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, otherwise `ans` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n`. The value of `once` is False if the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, otherwise `once` is True.
