The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If arr has at least 1 integer the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty. So for the loop to be executed  the list must have at least 1 integer and the i is the first integer in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is the first integer in the list, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty**
