Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of i is t, i is the last element in the list arr, ans is 0, once is False, stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 0, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of i is t, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then i is 0, ans is 1, and once is True. Otherwise, the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 3, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is i. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then i is 0, ans is 1, and once is True. Otherwise, the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: *t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 4, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is i. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then i is 0, ans is 1, and once is True. Otherwise, if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then once remains True. If counter.get(i, 0) is greater than 1, then the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 5, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is i. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then i is 0, ans is 1, and once is True. Otherwise, if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then once remains True. If counter.get(i, 0) is greater than 1, then the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 6, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is i and once is True. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1. Otherwise, if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then once remains True. If counter.get(i, 0) is greater than 1, then the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
