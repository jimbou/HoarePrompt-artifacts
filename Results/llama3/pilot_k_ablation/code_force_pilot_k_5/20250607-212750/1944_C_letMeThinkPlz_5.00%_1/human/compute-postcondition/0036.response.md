Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 1, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 1, ans is i + 1, once is True**

The code snippet does not modify the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, or `counter`, so their states remain unchanged. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, and the value of `i + 1` is assigned to `ans`. The variable `once` is set to `True`. The `break` statement does not affect the state of any variables.
