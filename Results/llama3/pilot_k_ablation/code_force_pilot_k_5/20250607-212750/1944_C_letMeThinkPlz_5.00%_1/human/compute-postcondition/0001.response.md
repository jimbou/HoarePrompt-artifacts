The only variable in the loop head is variable `_` and `t`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, `_` needs to be adjusted to 0 (the initial value of the loop variable in a `range` loop).
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0**
