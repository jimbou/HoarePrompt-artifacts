Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty**

In this final state, the initial values of `t` and `_` remain unchanged. The code introduces three new variables: `n`, `arr`, and `counter`. The value of `n` is an integer obtained from the first input, and `arr` is a list of integers obtained from the second input. The `counter` variable is initialized as an empty dictionary. After the code execution, stdin is empty, indicating that all inputs have been consumed.
