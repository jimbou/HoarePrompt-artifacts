Output: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to t, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of i is t, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is i and once is True. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1. Otherwise, if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then once remains True. If counter.get(i, 0) is greater than 1, then the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged, and the value of ans is being printed.**
