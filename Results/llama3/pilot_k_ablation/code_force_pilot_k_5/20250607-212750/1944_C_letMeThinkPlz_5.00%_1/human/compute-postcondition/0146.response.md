Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, and the second element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 2, and the third element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 4, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is not defined, `once` is not defined, `i` is the third element in the list**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to 4, since `i` is the third element in the list and its initial value in the dictionary was 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
