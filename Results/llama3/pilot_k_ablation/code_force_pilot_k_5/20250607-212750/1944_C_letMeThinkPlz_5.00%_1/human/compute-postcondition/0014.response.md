Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, stdin is empty**

This output state indicates that the loop has executed for all elements in the list `arr`. The variable `i` now holds the last integer from the original list, and the dictionary `counter` contains all integers from the original list as keys with their respective counts as values. The other variables, `t`, `_`, `n`, and `stdin`, remain unchanged as they were not affected by the loop.
