To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`. However, for the loop to execute, `i` should be the first element in the list `arr`. 

So, for the loop to be executed, the list `arr` must have at least 1 element and `i` is the first element in the list `arr`.

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `i` is the first element in the list `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the first element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1` if the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, otherwise `ans` is the first element in the list `arr` plus `n`, `once` is False if the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, otherwise `once` is True**
