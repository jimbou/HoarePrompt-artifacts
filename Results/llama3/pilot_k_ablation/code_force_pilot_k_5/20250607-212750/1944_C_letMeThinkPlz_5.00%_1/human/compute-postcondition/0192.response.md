To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `arr` has at least one more element. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the third element in the list, and `arr` has at least 3 elements.

For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` must be the fourth element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1 and the count of the third element in `arr` is the current count of the third element in `arr` plus 2 and the count of the fourth element in `arr` is the current count of the fourth element in `arr` plus 3, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the fourth element in the list.**
