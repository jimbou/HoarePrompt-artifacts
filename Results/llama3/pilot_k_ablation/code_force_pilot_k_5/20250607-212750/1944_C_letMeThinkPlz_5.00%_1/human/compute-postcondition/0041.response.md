Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 2, once is True, ans is i + 1**

The code block consists of three lines: `once = True`, `ans = i + 1`, and `break`. The first line assigns the value `True` to the variable `once`. The second line assigns the value of `i + 1` to the variable `ans`. The third line is a `break` statement, which does not affect any variables.

Since the `break` statement does not affect any variables, the output state only includes the changes made by the first two lines. The value of `once` is now `True`, and the value of `ans` is `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.
