Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `arr` is the current count of the element in `arr` plus the number of times the element appears in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is not True, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 5.**
