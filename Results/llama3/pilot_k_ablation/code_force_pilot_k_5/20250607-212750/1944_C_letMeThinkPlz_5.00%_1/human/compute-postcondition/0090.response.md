Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is `n` more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is True and `ans` is `i + 1`. If the count of `i` in `counter` is more than 1 or `once` is True, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is as follows:

The loop will iterate `n` times. In each iteration, it checks the count of the current integer `i` in the `counter` dictionary. If the count is 0, it sets `ans` to `i` and `once` to False. If the count is 1 and `once` is False, it sets `once` to True and `ans` to `i + 1`. If the count is more than 1 or `once` is True, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

After the loop finishes executing all `n` iterations, the state of the variables is as follows:

* `t` remains an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive).
* `_` remains 1.
* `n` remains an integer that must be greater than the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`.
* `arr` remains a list of integers that must have at least `n` integers.
* `counter` remains a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is `n` more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`.
* `i` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`.
* `stdin` remains empty.

The values of `ans` and `once` depend on the counts of the integers in the `counter` dictionary. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is True and `ans` is `i + 1`. If the count of `i` in `counter` is more than 1 or `once` is True, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.
