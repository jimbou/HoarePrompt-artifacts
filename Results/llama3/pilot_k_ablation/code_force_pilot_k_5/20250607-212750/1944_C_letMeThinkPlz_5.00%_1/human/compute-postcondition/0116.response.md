The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and `n`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 3, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of i is t, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then i is 0, ans is 1, and once is True. Otherwise, the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged.**
