The value of `counter[i]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `i` is the second integer in the list `arr`, and `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 1 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, the value of `counter[i]` is now 2 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 2 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the second integer in the list `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty**
