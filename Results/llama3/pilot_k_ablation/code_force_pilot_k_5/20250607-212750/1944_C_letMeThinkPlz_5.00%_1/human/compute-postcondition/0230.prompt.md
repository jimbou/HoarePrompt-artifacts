Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n).
Code of the loop:
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counter = {}
    for i in arr:
        counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1
    ans = 0
    once = False
    for i in range(n):
        if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
            ans = i
            break
        elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
            once = True
            ans = i + 1
            break
    print(ans)


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, ans is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, once is True, and stdin is empty, and the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, which is ans, is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is `n` more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `stdin` is empty. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is True and `ans` is `i + 1`. If the count of `i` in `counter` is more than 1 or `once` is True, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, and the value of `ans` is being printed

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to t, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of i is t, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is i and once is True. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then once is True and ans is i + 1. Otherwise, if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is True, then once remains True. If counter.get(i, 0) is greater than 1, then the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged, and the value of ans is being printed.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 3, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to t, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in the list and the value is the number of occurrences of that element, stdin is empty, ans is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, once is True, i is the last element in the list, and ans is printed

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: ans is the smallest number that is not in the counter dictionary or the smallest number that appears only once in the counter dictionary and has not been previously selected as the answer, once is True, and i is n-1, and ans is printed




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
