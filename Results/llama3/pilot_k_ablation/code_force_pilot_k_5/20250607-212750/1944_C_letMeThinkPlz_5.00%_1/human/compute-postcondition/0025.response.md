Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, stdin is empty, ans is i, once is True**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, and the second line breaks out of the loop. 

Since the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, the state of the variables changes as follows: `ans` becomes `i`, and `once` becomes `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

The final state of the variables is as follows: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is `i`, and `once` is `True`.
