Output State: **t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 3, n is an integer greater than t + 2 and greater than 0, arr is a list of integers with at least t + 2 elements, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in the list and the value is the number of occurrences of that element, once is True, ans is t + 3, i is t + 2, stdin is empty.**

In this final state, the value of `once` has been set to True, and the value of `ans` has been updated to `t + 3` based on the value of `i` which is `t + 2`. The rest of the variables remain unchanged.
