Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer, arr is a list of integers, counter is an empty dictionary, i is the last integer in the original list, ans is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, once is True, and stdin is empty**

Explanation:
The first line assigns the integer value of the input to `n`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The second line assigns a list of integers from stdin to `arr`. Since stdin is empty, this line does not affect the state of stdin. The third line initializes an empty dictionary `counter`. The values of `t`, `_`, `i`, `ans`, and `once` are not affected by the code snippet.
