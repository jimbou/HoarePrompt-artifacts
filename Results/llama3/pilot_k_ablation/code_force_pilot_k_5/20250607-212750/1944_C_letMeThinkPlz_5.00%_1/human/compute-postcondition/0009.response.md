The only variable in the loop head is variable `i` and list `arr`, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 4 integers the loop executes again for the fourth time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 4 integers and the `i` is the fourth integer in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with the third integer as a key and its value is increased by 1, `stdin` is empty**
