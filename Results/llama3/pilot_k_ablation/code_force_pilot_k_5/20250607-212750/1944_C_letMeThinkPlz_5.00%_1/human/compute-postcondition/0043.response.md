Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 2. If counter.get(i, 0) == 0, then ans is i + 2. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once), then once is True and ans is i + 1.***
