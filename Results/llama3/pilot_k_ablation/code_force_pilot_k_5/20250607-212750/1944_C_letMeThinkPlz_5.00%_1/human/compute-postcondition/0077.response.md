Output State: **t is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 1, n is an integer that must be greater than the last integer in the list arr plus 2, arr is a list of integers that must have at least n integers, counter is a dictionary with i as a key and its value is n more than the previous count of i in arr, i is the last integer in the list arr plus 2, once is True, ans is i + 1, stdin is empty.**

In this output state, the values of `t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `counter`, and `i` remain unchanged as they were not modified by the code. The code only modified the values of `once` and `ans`. The value of `once` is now True, and the value of `ans` is now `i + 1`. The stdin remains empty as it was initially.
