Output State: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the list as keys and their respective counts as values, `stdin` is empty.

In natural language, the output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `arr` is empty, the variable `i` holds the last integer from the list, and the dictionary `counter` contains all the integers from the list as keys with their respective counts as values. The other variables `t`, `_`, `n`, and `stdin` remain unchanged.
