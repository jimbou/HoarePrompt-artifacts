Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2 and at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `arr` is the current count of the element in `arr` plus the number of times the element appears in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2, and either `ans` is 1 if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, `ans` is 2 if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is 0 or `i` if `counter.get(i, 0)` is greater than 1 and `once` is False, or `ans` is 3 and `once` is True if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False.**
