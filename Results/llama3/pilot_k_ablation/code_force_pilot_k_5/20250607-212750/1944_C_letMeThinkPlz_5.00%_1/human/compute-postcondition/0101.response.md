To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for i in arr:`, which means we can only adjust the states of `i` and `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute again if `arr` has at least one more element. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` has at least 3 elements, and `i` is the third element in the list.

To execute the loop again, `arr` must have at least 4 elements, and `i` must be the fourth element in the list.

Here's the updated state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 3, `i` is the fourth element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the fourth element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is False**

Note that we didn't change the states of `t`, `_`, `n`, `counter`, `ans`, or `once` because they are not involved in the loop head.
