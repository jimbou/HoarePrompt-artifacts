To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `arr`.

According to the code, the loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element. Since `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive) and `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, we can infer that `arr` must have at least `t` elements.

Before the loop starts, `i` is the last element in the list. For the loop to execute, `i` should be the first element in the list.

Here is the adjusted state:

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, `i` is the first element in the list, and `ans` is printed**
