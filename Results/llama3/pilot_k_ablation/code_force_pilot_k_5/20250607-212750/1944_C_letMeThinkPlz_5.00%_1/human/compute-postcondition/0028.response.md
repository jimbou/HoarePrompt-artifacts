Postcondition: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, `stdin` is empty. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is `True`. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
