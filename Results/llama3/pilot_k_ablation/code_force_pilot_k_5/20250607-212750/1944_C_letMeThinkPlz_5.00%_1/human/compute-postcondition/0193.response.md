Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1 and the count of the third element in `arr` is the current count of the third element in `arr` plus 2 and the count of the fourth element in `arr` is the current count of the fourth element in `arr` plus 4, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the fourth element in the list.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` is still between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). The value of `_` is still 4. The value of `n` is still greater than or equal to `t`. The list `arr` still has at least 4 elements. The dictionary `counter` has been updated such that the count of the fourth element in `arr` is increased by 1. The `stdin` is still empty. The value of `ans` is still the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list. The value of `once` is still True. The value of `i` is still the fourth element in the list.
