The code snippet consists of two lines that assign values to variables. The first line assigns 0 to the variable `ans`, and the second line assigns `False` to the variable `once`. 

The initial state provided includes several variables: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is an empty list, `i` is the last integer in the original list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, and stdin is empty.

After executing the code snippet, the values of `ans` and `once` are updated. `ans` becomes 0, and `once` becomes `False`. The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, ans is 0, once is False, and stdin is empty.**
