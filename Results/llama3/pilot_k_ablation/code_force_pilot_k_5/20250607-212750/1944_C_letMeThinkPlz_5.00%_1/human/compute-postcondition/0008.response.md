The value of `counter[i]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. The current value of `counter[i]` is either 0 or some positive integer, since `i` is the third integer in the list `arr` and `counter` is a dictionary with the third integer as a key. The value of `i` is the third integer in the list `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 integers, `i` is the third integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with the third integer as a key and its value is increased by 1, `stdin` is empty**
