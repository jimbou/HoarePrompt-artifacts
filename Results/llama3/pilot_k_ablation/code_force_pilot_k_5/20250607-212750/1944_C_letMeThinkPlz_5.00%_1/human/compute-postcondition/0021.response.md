Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, arr is an empty list, i is 0, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, ans is 1, once is True, and stdin is empty. The count of i in counter is 1.**

In this output state, the value of `once` has been changed to `True`, and the value of `ans` has been updated to `i + 1`, which is 1 since `i` is 0. All other variables remain unchanged.
