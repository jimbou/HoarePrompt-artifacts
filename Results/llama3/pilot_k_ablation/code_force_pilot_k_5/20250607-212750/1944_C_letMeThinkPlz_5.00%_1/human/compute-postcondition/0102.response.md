The value of `counter[i]` is incremented by 1, where `i` is the fourth element in the list `arr`. The previous value of `counter[i]` is 3. Therefore, the new value of `counter[i]` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 4, `i` is the fourth element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the fourth element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is False**
