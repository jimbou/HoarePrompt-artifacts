Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 3, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to t, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is an empty dictionary, stdin is empty, ans is not defined, once is not defined
Code of the loop:
for i in arr:
    counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is not defined, `once` is not defined, `i` is the first element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, and the second element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 2, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is not defined, `once` is not defined, `i` is the second element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, and the second element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 2, and the third element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 4, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is not defined, `once` is not defined, `i` is the third element in the list

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, and the second element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 2, and the third element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 4, and the fourth element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 9, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is not defined, `once` is not defined, `i` is the fourth element in the list.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the key is the first element in the list and the value is 1, and the second element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 2, and the third element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 4, and the fourth element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 9, and the fifth element in the list is also a key in the dictionary with a value of 17, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is not defined, `once` is not defined, `i` is the fifth element in the list.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
