Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is the second integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and 2 as its value, `stdin` is empty**

The code increments the value of `counter[i]` by 1. Since `counter[i]` was initially 1, its new value is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
