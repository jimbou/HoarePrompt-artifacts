Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 2, n is an integer that must be greater than 3, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is i. If counter.get(i, 0) is not 0, then if counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and once is False, then i is 0, ans is 1, and once is True. Otherwise, the values of i, ans, and once remain unchanged.***
