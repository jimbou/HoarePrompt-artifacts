Output State: **`t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in the list `arr`, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is 4 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `ans` is the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1, and `once` is True, and `stdin` is empty**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to be 4 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, because the previous count was 3 more than the previous count of `i` in `arr` and we added 1 to it. The other variables remain unchanged.
