Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 4, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to t, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of each element in arr is the current count of the element in arr plus the number of times the element appears in arr, stdin is empty, ans is 0, once is False, and i is the last element in the list.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t` and at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `arr` is the current count of the element in `arr` plus the number of times the element appears in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, and `i` is 0. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, then `ans` is 0 and `once` is False. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is greater than 0, then if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is True. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t` and at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `arr` is the current count of the element in `arr` plus the number of times the element appears in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 1, `ans` is 1 if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, otherwise `ans` is 2 if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `once` is False, otherwise `ans` is 0 or `i`, and `once` is True if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0 or 1 and `once` is False, otherwise `once` is False.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 2 and at least 3, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `arr` is the current count of the element in `arr` plus the number of times the element appears in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 2. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, then `ans` is 2 and `once` is True. Otherwise, if `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1, then `ans` is 2 if `once` is False, otherwise `ans` is 3 and `once` is True. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is greater than 1, then `ans` is 0 or `i` if `once` is False, otherwise `ans` is 3 and `once` is True.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 4, n is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t elements, counter is a dictionary where the count of each element in arr is the current count of the element in arr plus the number of times the element appears in arr, stdin is empty, i is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) equals 0, then ans is 3. If counter.get(i, 0) equals 1 and once is False, then ans is 4 and once is True. Otherwise, the values of ans and once remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to 4, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of each element in `arr` is the current count of the element in `arr` plus the number of times the element appears in `arr`, `stdin` is empty, `i` is 4. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is 4. Otherwise, if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is not True, then `once` is set to True and `ans` is 5.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
