The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from the standard input and assigns it to the variable `t`. The initial state mentions that the first line of stdin contains a single integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 2 * 10^4) — the number of test cases.

After executing the code, the value of `t` is assigned the integer value from the input, which is between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). The stdin now contains the remaining test cases, which includes the description of each test case.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), stdin contains multiple test cases, where each test case consists of a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^5) followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, …, a_n` (0 ≤ a_i < n).**
