The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t + 1`, `n` is greater than `t + 2`. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is `t + 2` and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than `t + 2`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than `t + 2` and greater than 0, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t + 2` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in the list and the value is the number of occurrences of that element, `stdin` is empty. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. If `counter.get(i, 0)` is 1 and `(not once)`, then `once` is True and `ans` is `t + 2`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, `i` is `t + 2**
