To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved. In this case, the loop head is `for i in arr:`.

From the given state, we know that `i` is the second element in the list `arr`, and `arr` must have at least 2 elements. To execute the loop again, `arr` must have at least 3 elements, and `i` should be the third element in the list.

The other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `counter`, `ans`, and `once`) are not directly involved in the loop head, so their states do not need to be adjusted.

Therefore, the adjusted state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 2, `i` is the third element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the third element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is False.**
