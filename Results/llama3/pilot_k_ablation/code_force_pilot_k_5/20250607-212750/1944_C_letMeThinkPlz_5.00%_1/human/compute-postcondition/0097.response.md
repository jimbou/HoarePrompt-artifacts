The only object in the loop head is variable  i and list arr, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list arr.  If the list has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, arr has at least 1 element, i is the first element in the list arr. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 2 elements and the i is the second element in the list.
State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 1, `i` is the second element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the second element in the list `arr` plus `n` if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1, otherwise `ans` is the second element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is True if the count of `i` in `counter` is 1, otherwise `once` is False, stdin is empty.**
