The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and n, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than `i`.
State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, `stdin` is empty. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is 1 and `once` is `True`. Otherwise, `ans` remains 0 and `once` remains `False`.**
