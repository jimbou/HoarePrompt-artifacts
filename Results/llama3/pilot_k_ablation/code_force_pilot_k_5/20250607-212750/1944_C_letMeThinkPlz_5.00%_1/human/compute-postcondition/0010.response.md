Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 4 integers, `i` is the fourth integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with the third integer as a key and its value is increased by 1, and the value of `i` is also a key in `counter` with its value increased by 1.**

In natural language, the output state is: The value of `t` remains between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), the value of `_` is still 0, the value of `n` is still an integer, the list `arr` still has at least 4 integers, and `i` is still the fourth integer in the list. The dictionary `counter` now has two keys: the third integer in the list with its value increased by 1, and the value of `i` with its value increased by 1.
