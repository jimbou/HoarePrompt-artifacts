The code `counter[i] = counter.get(i, 0) + 1` increments the value of `i` in the `counter` dictionary by 1. Since `i` is already a key in `counter` with its value increased by 1, the new value of `i` in `counter` will be increased by 1 again.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 5 integers, `i` is the fifth integer in the list, `counter` is a dictionary with the third integer as a key and its value is increased by 1, and the value of `i` is also a key in `counter` with its value increased by 2**
