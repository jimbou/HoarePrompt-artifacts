Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 3, `i` is the third element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the third element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been updated to 3, as it was previously 2 and the code increments it by 1. The other variables remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code.
