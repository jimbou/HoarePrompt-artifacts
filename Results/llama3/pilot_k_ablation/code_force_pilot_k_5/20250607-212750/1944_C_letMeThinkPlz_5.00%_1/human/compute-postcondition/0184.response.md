To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop head and adjust the states of the objects involved.

The loop head is `for _ in range(t):`. The only objects in the loop head are `_` and `t`.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `_` and `t`. If `_` is less than `t`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, and `t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `_` must be incremented by 1, so `_` becomes 4. The value of `t` remains the same.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, `counter` is a dictionary where each key is an element in the list and the value is the number of occurrences of that element, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, `i` is the last element in the list, and `ans` is printed**
