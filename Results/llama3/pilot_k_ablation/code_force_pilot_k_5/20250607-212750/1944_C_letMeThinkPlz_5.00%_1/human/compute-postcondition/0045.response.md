The `print(ans)` statement will print the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1.

Since the exact original list is not provided, we can't determine the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest integer that meets the specified conditions.

Output: **the smallest integer that is not in the original list or is in the original list but has a count of 1**
