Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, stdin is empty. If the count of i in counter is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, then ans is 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and once remains False.***
