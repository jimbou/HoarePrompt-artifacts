Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer between 0 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 1, `n` is an integer that must be greater than the last integer in the list `arr` plus 4, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` integers, `counter` is a dictionary with `i` as a key and its value is `n` more than the previous count of `i` in `arr`, `i` is the last integer in the list `arr` plus 4, `stdin` is empty. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is False. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is False, then `once` is True and `ans` is `i + 1`. If the count of `i` in `counter` is more than 1 or `once` is True, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
