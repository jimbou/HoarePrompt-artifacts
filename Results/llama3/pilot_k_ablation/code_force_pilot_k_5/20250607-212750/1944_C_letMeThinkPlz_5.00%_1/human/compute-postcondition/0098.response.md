Output State: **`t` is an integer between 2 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 2, `n` is an integer, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of `i` is 2, `i` is the second element in the list `arr`, `ans` is the second element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, `once` is False.**

In this output state, the value of `counter[i]` has been incremented by 1, so it is now 2. As a result, the value of `ans` has changed to the second element in the list `arr` plus `n - 1`, and the value of `once` has changed to False. The other variables remain unchanged.
