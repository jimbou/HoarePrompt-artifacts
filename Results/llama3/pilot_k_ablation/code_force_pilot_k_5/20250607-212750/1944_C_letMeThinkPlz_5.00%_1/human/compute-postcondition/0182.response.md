The code prints the value of `ans`, which is the smallest number that is not in the list `arr` or the smallest number that appears only once in the list `arr` and is greater than the last element in the list `arr`. The value of `ans` is determined by the contents of the list `arr` and the value of `i`, which is the last element in the list `arr`.

Since the exact contents of the list `arr` are not provided, we can't compute the exact numerical value of `ans`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the smallest number that meets the specified conditions.

Output: **the smallest number that is not in the list arr or the smallest number that appears only once in the list arr and is greater than the last element in the list arr**
