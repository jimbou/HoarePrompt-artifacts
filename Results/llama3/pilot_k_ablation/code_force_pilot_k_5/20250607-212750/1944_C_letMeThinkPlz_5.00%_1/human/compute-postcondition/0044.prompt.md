Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer, arr is an empty list, i is the last integer in the original list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, ans is 0, once is False, and stdin is empty.
Code of the loop:
for i in range(n):
    if counter.get(i, 0) == 0:
        ans = i
        break
    elif counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and not once:
        once = True
        ans = i + 1
        break


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: *t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than 0, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, stdin is empty. If the count of i in counter is 0, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If the count of i in counter is 1 and once is False, then ans is 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans remains 0 and once remains False.

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, `stdin` is empty. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is `True`. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**: `t` is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 0, `n` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `arr` is an empty list, `counter` is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i` and `once` is `True`. If the count of `i` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is `True`. If the count of `i + 1` in `counter` is 0, then `ans` is `i + 1` and `once` is `True`. If the count of `i + 1` in `counter` is 1 and `once` is `False`, then `ans` is `i + 2` and `once` is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 4 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 1. If counter.get(i, 0) == 0, then ans is i. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and once is False, then ans is i + 1 and once is True. Otherwise, ans and once remain unchanged.

**Output State after the loop executes 5 times**: *t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 2, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 2. If counter.get(i, 0) == 0, then ans is i + 2. If counter.get(i, 0) == 1 and (not once), then once is True and ans is i + 1.




What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
