Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, i is i + 1, ans is i, once is unchanged**

The code snippet consists of two lines: `ans = i` and `break`. The first line assigns the value of `i` to `ans`, effectively updating the value of `ans`. The second line, `break`, terminates the loop or block of code it is part of, but since there is no loop or block defined in the provided code snippet, its effect is not applicable in this context.

Given the initial state, the only variable affected by the code is `ans`, which is assigned the value of `i`. All other variables (`t`, `_`, `n`, `arr`, `counter`, `i`, and `once`) remain unchanged as they are not modified by the provided code snippet.
