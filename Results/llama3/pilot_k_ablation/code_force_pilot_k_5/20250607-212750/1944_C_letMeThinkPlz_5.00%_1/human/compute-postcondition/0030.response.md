Output State: **t is an integer between 1 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 0, n is an integer greater than i + 1, arr is an empty list, counter is a dictionary with all integers from the original list as keys and their respective counts as values, ans is i, once is True if the count of i + 1 in counter is 0 or 1 and once was False, otherwise once remains unchanged.**

In this output state, the value of `ans` has been updated to `i`, and the value of `once` has been updated based on the count of `i + 1` in the `counter` dictionary and the original value of `once`. All other variables remain unchanged.
