According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `t` elements, so it needs to be adjusted to `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element and `i` is now the first element in the list.

State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 3, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `counter` is an empty dictionary, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is not defined, `once` is not defined, `i` is the first element in the list**
