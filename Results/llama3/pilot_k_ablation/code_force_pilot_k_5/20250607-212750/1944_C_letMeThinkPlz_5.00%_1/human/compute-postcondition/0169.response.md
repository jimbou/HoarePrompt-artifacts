Postcondition: ***t is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), _ is 3, n is an integer that must be greater than t + 1 and greater than 0, arr is a list of integers that must have at least t + 2 elements, counter is a dictionary where each key is an element in the list and the value is the number of occurrences of that element, stdin is empty. If counter.get(i, 0) is 0, then ans is 0. If counter.get(i, 0) is 1 and (not once), then once is True and ans is i + 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
