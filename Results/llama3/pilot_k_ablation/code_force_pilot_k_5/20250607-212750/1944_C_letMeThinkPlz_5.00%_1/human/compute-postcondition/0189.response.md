The value of `counter[i]` is updated to be the current count of `i` in `counter` plus 1. The current count of `i` in `counter` is either the current value of `counter[i]` if `i` is already in `counter`, or 0 if `i` is not in `counter`. The value of `i` is the second element in the list `arr`. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer between 3 and 2 * 10^4 (inclusive), `_` is 4, `n` is an integer that must be greater than or equal to `t`, `arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `counter` is a dictionary where the count of the first element in `arr` is 1 and the count of the second element in `arr` is the current count of the second element in `arr` plus 1, `stdin` is empty, `ans` is the smallest number that is not in the list or the smallest number that appears only once in the list and is greater than the last element in the list, `once` is True, and `i` is the second element in the list.**
