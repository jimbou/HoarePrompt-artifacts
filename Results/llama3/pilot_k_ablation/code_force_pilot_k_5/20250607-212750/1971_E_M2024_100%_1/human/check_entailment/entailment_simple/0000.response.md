Reasoning:

The given Python program is designed to solve the problem described. It first reads the number of test cases, then for each test case, it reads the final destination `n`, the number of points `k`, and the number of queries `q`. It then reads the `k` points `a` and their corresponding times `b`.

The program calculates the differences between consecutive points `ad` and their corresponding time differences `bd`. It also calculates the speed `v` at each point by dividing the distance difference by the time difference.

For each query, the program uses binary search to find the segment where the query point `ql` lies. If the query point is exactly at a known point, it prints the corresponding time. Otherwise, it calculates the time by adding the time at the start of the segment and the time it takes to travel from the start of the segment to the query point at the speed of the segment.

The program correctly handles the case where the query point is at the start or end of a segment and calculates the time accordingly.

Correctness: **True**
