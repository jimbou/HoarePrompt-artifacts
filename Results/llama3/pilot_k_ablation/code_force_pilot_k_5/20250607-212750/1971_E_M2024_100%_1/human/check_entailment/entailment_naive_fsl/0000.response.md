Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to calculate the time taken by the car to reach a certain point based on the given distances and times. It uses binary search to find the appropriate segment of the journey and then calculates the time based on the speed of that segment.

The program handles all edge cases correctly, including when the query point is exactly at one of the known points, and when the query point is between two known points. It also handles the case when the query point is beyond the last known point.

The use of binary search ensures that the program runs efficiently even for large inputs. The calculations for the time taken are also correct, taking into account the speed of the segment and the distance traveled.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
