Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(b)` integers, `ad` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 2] / bd[len(a) - 2]`, `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `i` is 2, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`, nothing is printed, `t` is at least 2, stdin contains 0 inputs, and nothing is printed.**

In this output state, the value of `v` has been updated by appending the result of `ad[i] / bd[i]`, where `i` is 2. The other variables remain unchanged.
