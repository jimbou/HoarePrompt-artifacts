To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the states of objects in the loop head, which are the variable `i` and the list `b`. According to the code, the loop will execute if the length of `b` is at least 2, because the loop starts from index 1 and goes up to the second last index of `b`. 

Since `i` is the loop variable, it should be initialized to 1, which is the starting index of the loop. The length of `b` should be at least 2 for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 2 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 1**
