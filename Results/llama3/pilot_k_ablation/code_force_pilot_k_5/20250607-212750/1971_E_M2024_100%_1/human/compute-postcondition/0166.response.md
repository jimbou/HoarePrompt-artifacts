Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is an integer and must be greater than 3, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 4, ql is an integer equal to ql - a[s-1], m is an integer equal to m + b[s-1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].**

The code modifies the values of `ql`, `m`, and `s` while keeping all other variables unchanged. The value of `ql` is reduced by `a[s-1]`, `m` is incremented by `b[s-1]` and then further incremented by the product of `bd[s]` and the integer division of `ql` by `ad[s]`, and `s` remains the same as it was not modified by the code.
