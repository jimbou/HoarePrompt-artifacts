Output State: **t is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, _ is 0, n is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, q is a non-negative integer such that 3 <= q <= 10^5, a is a list of at least k+1 integers, b is a list of at least k+1 integers, ad is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], bd is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], v is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], i is 1, l is 3, ql is an integer such that ql = ql - a[s - 1], m is an integer such that m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s].**

The code modifies the values of `ql` and `m`. The first line subtracts the value of `a[s - 1]` from `ql`, updating its value. The second line adds the value of `b[s - 1]` to `m`. The third line adds the result of the integer division of `bd[s] * ql` by `ad[s]` to `m`, further updating its value. No other variables are affected by the code.
