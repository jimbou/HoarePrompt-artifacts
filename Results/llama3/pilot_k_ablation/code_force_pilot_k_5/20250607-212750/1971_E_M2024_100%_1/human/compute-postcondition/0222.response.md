The code prints the value of `b[s]`, where `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`, and `ql` is an integer read from stdin.

Since the exact value of `ql` is not provided, we can't determine the exact value of `s`. However, based on the structure of the problem, the print statement will output the value of `b[s]` corresponding to the value of `s` that satisfies the condition `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`.

Output: **b[s] (where s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and ql is an integer read from stdin)**
