Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least 4 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing five integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], b[3] - b[2], and b[4] - b[3], stdin contains multiple test cases minus one, `i` is 3**

In this output state, the value of `bd` has been updated by appending the difference between `b[4]` and `b[3]`, which is `b[i] - b[i - 1]` since `i` is 3. The other variables remain unchanged.
