The only variable in the loop head is variable `l`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `l` and `q`. If `l` is less than `q`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is 1, `q` is at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `l` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is at least 2, `a` is a list of at least `len(a)` integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(a)` + `len(b)` - 1 integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1]` - `a[0]`, `a[2]` - `a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1]` - `a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers 0, `b[1]` - `b[0]`, `b[2]` - `b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1]` - `b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `ad[1]` / `bd[1]`, `ad[2]` / `bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 1]` / `bd[len(a) - 1]`, `i` is 1, `l` is 2, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is an integer equal to `b[s-1]` plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, nothing is printed, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains -1 inputs, and this is printed: `m` (where `m` is an integer equal to `b[s-1]` plus `bd[s]` times `ql` divided by `ad[s]`)**
