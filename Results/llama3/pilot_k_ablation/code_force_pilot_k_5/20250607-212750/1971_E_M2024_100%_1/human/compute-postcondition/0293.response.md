The only variables in the loop head are variables  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers. For the loop to execute again `i` is increased by 1 so `i` is 5 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be a list of at least 5 integers.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 5 integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(a) + len(b) - 1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1]` - `a[0]`, `a[2]` - `a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1]` - `a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers 0, `b[1]` - `b[0]`, `b[2]` - `b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1]` - `b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing 5 integers 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, `ad[3] / bd[3]`, and `ad[4] / bd[4]`, `i` is 5, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1]` < `ql` <= `a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `t` is at least 1, `stdin` contains 0 inputs.**
