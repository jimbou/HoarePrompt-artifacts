To ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the state of the variable `t` and the loop variable `_` (which is a throwaway variable and doesn't need a specific value, but its presence indicates the loop will execute). According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 1, the loop can execute.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, stdin contains multiple test cases. Each test case contains four lines of input. The first line contains three integers n, k, and q. The second and third lines contain k integers. The fourth line contains q integers. n, k, and q are non-negative integers such that 1 <= k, q <= 10^5 and k <= n <= 10^9. The sum of k over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5, and the sum of q over all test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.**
