Postcondition: **n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is at least 4, a is a list of at least len(a) integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing 1 integer 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing 1 integer 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing 1 integer 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 2] / bd[len(a) - 2], ad[i] / bd[i], i is 1, l is 3, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is an integer equal to the sum of b[s-1] and the integer division of (bd[s] * ql) by ad[s], s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql + a[s-1] <= a[s], nothing is printed, t is at least 2, stdin contains -1 inputs, and nothing is printed, and m is printed, m (where m is the updated value). If a[s] is equal to ql, then b[s] is printed and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, no action is taken, and m is printed followed by a space, m is 0, i is 1, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql + a[s-1] <= a[s], and b[s] is printed followed by a space, and m is printed followed by a space, and b[s] is printed followed by a space, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
