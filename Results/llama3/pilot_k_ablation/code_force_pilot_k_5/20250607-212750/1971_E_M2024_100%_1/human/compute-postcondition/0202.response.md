The only variable in the loop head is variable `i`, so we can only adjust that one. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `a`. If `i` is less than the length of `a`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `a` is a list of at least 3 integers. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of at least `k+1` integers, `ad` is a list containing `len(a)` integers 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing `len(b)` integers 0, `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing 3 integers 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, `i` is 3, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer such that `ql = ql - a[s - 1] - a[s - 1] - ... - a[s - 1]` (q times), `m` is an integer such that `m = m + b[s - 1] + b[s - 1] + ... + b[s - 1]` (q times) + `bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s] + ... + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]` (q times), and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`, and nothing is printed, `_` is equal to `t` and `t` must be greater than `t`.**
