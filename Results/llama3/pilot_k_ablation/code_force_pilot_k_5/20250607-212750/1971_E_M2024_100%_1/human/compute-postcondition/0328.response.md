Output: **n is unchanged, k is unchanged, q is unchanged, a is unchanged, b is unchanged, ad is unchanged, bd is unchanged, v is unchanged, i is 1, m is increased by the value of b[s - 1] and then further increased by the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, t is unchanged, ql is decreased by the value of a[s - 1], l is increased by 1, stdin contains -1 inputs if a[s] is equal to ql, otherwise it contains -2 inputs, and the value of m is printed, and the value of b[s] is printed**
