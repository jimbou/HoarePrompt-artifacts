Postcondition: **The program continues to the next iteration of the loop if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, otherwise no action is taken. In both cases, the values of `n`, `k`, `q`, `a`, `b`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `i`, `l`, `ql`, `m`, `s`, and `t` remain unchanged, and nothing is printed. The stdin contains -1 inputs if `a[s]` is equal to `ql`, otherwise it contains -2 inputs.**
