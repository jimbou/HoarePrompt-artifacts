Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of k+1 integers that must have at least 10 elements, `b` is a list of k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing six integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], a[5] - a[4], a[7] - a[6], and a[9] - a[8], `bd` is a list containing a single integer 0, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one. Each remaining test case contains three lines of input. The first line contains q integers, i is 9**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that the list `ad` now contains an additional element, which is the difference between the 10th and 9th elements of list `a`. The value of `i` is still 9, and the stdin still contains multiple test cases minus one, with each remaining test case containing three lines of input, the first line containing q integers.
