Output State: **n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is an integer, a is a list of at least len(a) integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing 1 integer 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing 1 integer 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing 1 integer 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 2] / bd[len(a) - 2], ad[i] / bd[i], i is len(a) - 1, l is q, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is m plus b[s-1] plus the integer division of bd[s] times ql by ad[s], s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], nothing is printed, t is at least 2, stdin contains 0 inputs, and nothing is printed.**

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `v` contains the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, and the variable `i` has reached the second last index of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
