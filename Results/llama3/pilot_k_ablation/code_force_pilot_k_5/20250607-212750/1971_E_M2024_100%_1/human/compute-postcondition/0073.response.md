The code prints the value of `m` which is an integer such that `m = m + b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s]`, where `bd[s]` is the `s-th` element of the list `bd` which is `b[s] - b[s-1]`, `ad[s]` is the `s-th` element of the list `ad` which is `a[s] - a[s-1]`, `ql` is an integer such that `ql = ql - a[s - 1]`, `b[s-1]` is the `(s-1)th` element of the list `b`, and `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`.
