The only variable in the loop head is variable  i and a, so we can only adjust those ones. According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `a`. If `i` is less than `len(a)`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `a` is a list of at least 2 integers. For the loop to execute again `i` must be increased by 1 so `i` is 3 and for the loop to execute again `a` must be a list of at least 3 integers.
State: **`t` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, `_` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= n <= 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= q <= 10^5, `a` is a list of at least 3 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[3] - a[2], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing three integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], `i` is 3, stdin contains multiple test cases minus one.**
