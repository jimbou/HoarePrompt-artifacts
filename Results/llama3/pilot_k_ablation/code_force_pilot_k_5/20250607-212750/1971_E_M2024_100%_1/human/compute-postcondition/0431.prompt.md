Given a Python loop, an initial execution state, and the output states after the first 5 iterations of the loop, determine the output state after all the executions of the loop have finished. 

You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**

Initial State: Output State: `n` is an integer, `k` is at least 1 and less than the length of `a`, `q` is an integer, `a` is a list of at least `len(a)` integers, `b` is a list of at least `len(b)` integers, `ad` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `a[1] - a[0]`, `a[2] - a[1]`, ..., `a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2]`, `bd` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `b[1] - b[0]`, `b[2] - b[1]`, ..., `b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2]`, `v` is a list containing 1 integer 0, `ad[1] / bd[1]`, `ad[2] / bd[2]`, ..., `ad[len(a) - 2] / bd[len(a) - 2]`, `ad[i] / bd[i]`, `i` is `len(a) - 1`, `l` is `q`, `ql` is an integer equal to the input minus `a[s-1]`, `m` is `m` plus `b[s-1]` plus the integer division of `bd[s]` times `ql` by `ad[s]`, `s` is an integer such that `a[s-1] < ql <= a[s]`, nothing is printed, `t` is at least 2, stdin contains 0 inputs, and nothing is printed.

The output state after the loop executes all the iterations is that the list `v` contains the ratios of the differences between consecutive elements in `a` and `b`, and the variable `i` has reached the second last index of `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Code of the loop:
for l in range(q):
    m = 0
    i = 1
    ql = int(input())
    s = bisect_left(a, ql)
    if a[s] == ql:
        print(b[s], end=' ')
        continue
    ql -= a[s - 1]
    m += b[s - 1]
    m += bd[s] * ql // ad[s]
    print(m, end=' ')


The output state after the loop executes the first 5 of times includes what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times:

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: n is an integer, k is at least 1 and less than the length of a, q is at least 1, a is a list of at least len(a) integers, b is a list of at least len(b) integers, ad is a list containing 1 integer 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[len(a) - 1] - a[len(a) - 2], bd is a list containing 1 integer 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[len(b) - 1] - b[len(b) - 2], v is a list containing 1 integer 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[len(a) - 2] / bd[len(a) - 2], ad[i] / bd[i], i is 1, l is 0, ql is an integer equal to the input minus a[s-1], m is b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s], s is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql + a[s-1] <= a[s], nothing is printed, t is at least 2, stdin contains -1 inputs, and nothing is printed, and m is printed, m (where m is b[s - 1] plus bd[s] times ql divided by ad[s])

What is the ouput state after the loop executes all the iterations? Change the values of only the variables in the loop head and body.The state of the other variables in the precondition that are not affected by the loop head and body must remain unchanged.
In your response strictly use the format: Output State: **the output state you calculate.**, and describe this output state in Natural language easily understandable by humans.
