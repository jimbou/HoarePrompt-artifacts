Output State: **n, k, q, a, ad, bd, v, t are unchanged, i is 1, m is increased by the value of b[s - 1] and then further increased by the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s], s is the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order, ql is decreased by the value of a[s - 1], l is increased by 1, and the value of m is printed. If a[s] is equal to ql, stdin contains -1 inputs, the value of b[s] is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, stdin contains -2 inputs.**

In this output state, the values of n, k, q, a, ad, bd, v, and t remain unchanged. The value of i is still 1. The value of m has been modified in two steps: first, it was increased by the value of b[s - 1], and then it was further increased by the product of bd[s] and ql divided by ad[s]. The value of s is still the insertion point of ql in a to maintain sorted order. The value of ql has been decreased by the value of a[s - 1]. The value of l has been increased by 1. The value of m has been printed. If a[s] is equal to ql, stdin contains -1 inputs, the value of b[s] is printed, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, stdin contains -2 inputs.
