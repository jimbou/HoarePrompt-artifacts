Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^5, `q` is an integer and must be greater than 1, `a` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `b` is a list of at least k+1 integers, `ad` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, a[1] - a[0], a[2] - a[1], ..., a[k] - a[k-1], `bd` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, b[1] - b[0], b[2] - b[1], ..., b[k] - b[k-1], `v` is a list containing k+1 integers 0, ad[1] / bd[1], ad[2] / bd[2], ..., ad[k] / bd[k], `i` is 1, `l` is 2, `ql` is an integer equal to the input integer, `m` is an integer equal to b[s - 1] + bd[s] * ql // ad[s], and `s` is an integer such that a[s-1] < ql <= a[s], and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**

In natural language, the output state is the same as the initial state, with no changes to the variables. The only effect of the `continue` statement is to skip to the next iteration of the loop, without executing any further code in the current iteration.
