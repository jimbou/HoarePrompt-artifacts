Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `q`, `ad`, `bd`, `v`, `t` are unchanged, `i` is 1, `m` is increased by the value of `b[s - 1]` and then further increased by the product of `bd[s]` and `ql` divided by `ad[s]`, `s` is the insertion point of `ql` in `a` to maintain sorted order, `ql` is decreased by the value of `a[s - 1]`, `l` is 2, and the value of `m` is printed, `m` is 0, `ql` is an integer from stdin, `s` is an integer. If `a[s]` equals `ql`, the value of `b[s]` is printed, and we skip the rest of the code in the current loop iteration.***
